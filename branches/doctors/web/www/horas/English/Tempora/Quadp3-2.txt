Lesson from the book of Genesis
!Gen 14:8-12
8 And the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrha, and the king of Adama, and the king of Seboim, and the king of Bala, which is Segor, went out: and they set themselves against them in battle array in the woodland vale:
9 To wit, against Chodorlahomor king of the Elamites, and Thadal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Sennaar, and Arioch king of Pontus: four kings against five.
10 Now the woodland vale had many pits of slime. And the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrha turned their backs and were overthrown there: and they that remained fled to the mountain.
11 And they took all the substance of the Sodomites, and Gomorrhites, and all their victuals, and went their way:
12 And Lot also, the son of Abram's brother, who dwelt in Sodom, and his substance.

!Gen 14:13-16
13 And behold one that had escaped told Abram the Hebrew, who dwelt in the vale of Mambre the Amorrhite, the brother of Escol, and the brother of Aner: for these had made league with Abram.
14 Which when Abram had heard, to wit, that his brother Lot was taken, he numbered of the servants born in his house, three hundred and eighteen well appointed: and pursued them to Dan.
15 And dividing his company, he rushed upon them in the night: and defeated them, and pursued them as far as Hoba, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16 And he brought back all the substance, and Lot his brother, with his substance, the women also the people.

19 Blessed him, and said: Blessed be Abram by the most high God, who created heaven and earth.
20 And blessed be the most high God, by whose protection the enemies are in thy hands. And he gace him the tithes of all.
