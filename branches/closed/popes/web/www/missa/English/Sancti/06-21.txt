[Oratio]
O God, bestower of heavenly gifts, Who in the angelic youth Aloysius joined~
wondrous innocence of life to an equally wondrous love of penance; grant, by his~
merits and prayers, that we who have not followed him in his innocence may~
imitate him in his penance.

Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus
!Eccli 31:8-11
Happy the man found without fault, who turns not aside after gain, nor puts his trust in money nor in treasures! Who is he, that we may praise him? For he had done wonders in his life. He has been tested by gold and come off safe, and this remains his glory forever; he could have sinned but did not, could have done evil but would not, so that his possessions are secure in the Lord, and the assembly of the Saints shall recount his alms.

[Graduale]
!Ps 70:5-6
My trust, O Lord, from my youth; on You I depend from birth; from my mother’s~
womb You are my strength.
!Ps 40:13
V. But because of my integrity You sustain me and let me stand before You~
forever. Alleluia, alleluia.
!Ps 64:5
V. Happy the man You choose, and bring to dwell in Your courts. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 22:29-40
At that time, Jesus answered and said to the Sadducees, You err because you know~
neither the Scriptures nor the power of God. for at the Resurrection they will~
neither marry nor be given in marriage, but will be as angels of God in heaven.~
But as to the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you~
by God, saying, ‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of~
Jacob’? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. And when the crowds~
heard this, they marveled at His teaching. But the Pharisees, hearing that He~
had silenced the Sadducees, gathered together. And one of them, a doctor of the~
Law, putting Him to the test, asked Him, Master, which is the great commandment~
in the Law? Jesus said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with your whole~
heart, and with your whole soul, and with your whole mind.’ This is the greatest~
and the first commandment. And the second is like it, ‘You shall love your~
neighbor as yourself.’ On these two commandments depend the whole Law and the~
Prophets.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 23:3-4
Who can ascend the mountain of the Lord? or who may stand in His holy place? He~
whose hands are sinless, whose heart is clean.

[Secreta]
Make us take our place, O Lord, at Your heavenly banquet clothed in the~
wedding-garment which the loving preparation and constant tears of blessed~
Aloysius adorned with precious pears.

[Communio]
!Ps 77:24-25
He gave them heavenly bread; the bread of the angels was eaten by men.

[Postcommunio]
Grant, O Lord, that we who have been fed with the food of angels may angelic~
lives, and, following the example of him whom we honor today, may we spend our~
days in unceasing thanksgiving.
