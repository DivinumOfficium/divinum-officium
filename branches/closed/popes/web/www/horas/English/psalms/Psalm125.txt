125:1 (A gradual canticle.) When the Lord brought back the captivity of Sion, we became like men comforted.
125:2 Then was our mouth filled with gladness; and our tongue with joy. Then shall they say among the Gentiles: The Lord hath done great things for them.
125:3 The Lord hath done great things for us: we are become joyful.
125:4 Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as a stream in the south.
125:5 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
125:6 Going they went and wept, casting their seeds.
125:7 But coming they shall come with joyfulness, carrying their sheaves.
