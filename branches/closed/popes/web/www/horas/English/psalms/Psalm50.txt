50:1 (Unto the end, a psalm of David,)
50:2 (When Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had sinned with Bethsabee. [2 Kings 12.])
50:3 Have mercy on me, O God, according to thy great mercy. And according to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my iniquity.
50:4 Wash me yet more from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
50:5 For I know my iniquity, and my sin is always before me.
50:6 To thee only have I sinned, and have done evil before thee: that thou mayst be justified in thy words, and mayst overcome when thou art judged.
50:7 For behold I was conceived in iniquities; and in sins did my mother conceive me.
50:8 For behold thou hast loved truth: the uncertain and hidden things of thy wisdom thou hast made manifest to me.
50:9 Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed: thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow.
50:10 To my hearing thou shalt give joy and gladness: and the bones that have been humbled shall rejoice.
50:11 Turn away thy face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.
50:12 Create a clean heart in me, O God: and renew a right spirit within my bowels.
50:13 Cast me not away from thy face; and take not thy holy spirit from me.
50:14 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and strengthen me with a perfect spirit.
50:15 I will teach the unjust thy ways: and the wicked shall be converted to thee.
50:16 Deliver me from blood, O God, thou God of my salvation: and my tongue shall extol thy justice.
50:17 O Lord, thou wilt open my lips: and my mouth shall declare thy praise.
50:18 For if thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would indeed have given it: with burnt offerings thou wilt not be delighted.
50:19 A sacrifice to God is an afflicted spirit: a contrite and humbled heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
50:20 Deal favourably, O Lord, in thy good will with Sion; that the walls of Jerusalem may be built up.
50:21 Then shalt thou accept the sacrifice of justice, oblations and whole burnt offerings: then shall they lay calves upon thy altar.
