3:1 Why, O Lord, are they multiplied that afflict me? * many are they who rise up against me.
3:2 Many say to my soul: * There is no salvation for him in his God.
3:3 But thou, O Lord art my protector, * my glory, and the lifter up of my head.
3:4 I have cried to the Lord with my voice: * and he hath heard me from his holy hill.
3:5 I have slept and taken my rest: * and I have risen up, because the Lord hath protected me.
3:6 I will not fear thousands of the people, surrounding me: * arise, O Lord; save me, O my God.
3:7 For thou hast struck all them who are my adversaries without cause: * thou hast broken the teeth of sinners.
3:8 Salvation is of the Lord: * and thy blessing is upon thy people.
