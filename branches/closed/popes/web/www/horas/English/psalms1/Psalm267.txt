(Canticum Isaae * Isa 33:13-18)
 33:13 Hear, you that are far off, what I have done, and you that are near know my strength.
33:14 The sinners in Sion are afraid, trembling hath seized upon the hypocrites. Which of you can dwell with devouring fire? which of you shall dwell with everlasting burnings?
33:15 He that walketh in justices, and speaketh truth, that casteth away avarice by oppression, and shaketh his hands from all bribes, that stoppeth his ears lest he hear blood, and shutteth his eyes that he may see no evil.
33:16 He shall dwell on high, the fortifications of rocks shall be his highness: bread is given him, his waters are sure.
33:17 His eyes shall see the king in his beauty, they shall see the land far off.
33:18 Thy heart shall meditate fear: where is the learned? where is he that pondereth the words of the law? where is the teacher of little ones?
