02-15# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 13: How Lauds Are to Be Said On Ferias
_
But on ferias let the office of Lauds be thus recited, namely, in such wise that the sixty-sixth psalm is said without antiphon, somewhat slowly as on the Lord’s days, that all may assemble for the fiftieth which is to be said with antiphon. After it let other two psalms be said, as usual; namely, on Monday the fifth and thirty-fifth; on Tuesday the forty-second and fifty-sixth; on Wednesday the sixty-third and sixty-fourth; on Thursday the eighty-seventh and the eighty-ninth; on Friday the seventy-fifth and ninety-first; and on Saturday the hundred and forty-second and the canticle from Deuteronomy, which is to be divided into two Glorias, for on other days let a canticle from the prophets be said, each on its proper day, as in the psalter of the Roman Church. After this let the Laudates follow, then one lection from the Apostle to be recited from memory, responsory, hymn, versicle, Gospel canticle, litany: and that is the end.
