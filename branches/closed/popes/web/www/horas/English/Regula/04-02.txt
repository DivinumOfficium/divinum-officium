04-02# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 51: Concerning Brethren Who Do Not Go Far Away
_
Let not a brother who is sent out on any business but hopes to return to the monastery the same day presume to take food while out, even though he be frankly invited to do so by anyone, unless by chance it has been so ordered him by his abbot. And if he shall have done otherwise, let him be excommunicated.
