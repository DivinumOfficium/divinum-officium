Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, elect,

the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace~
unto you and peace be multiplied.
3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his~
great mercy hath regenerated us unto a lively hope, by the resurrection of Jesus~
Christ from the dead,
4 Unto an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that can not fade,~
reserved in heaven for you,
5 Who, by the power of God, are kept by faith unto salvation, ready to be~
revealed in the last time.

!1 Pet 1:6-12
6 Wherein you shall greatly rejoice, if now you must be for a little time made~
sorrowful in divers temptations:
7 That the trial of your faith (much more precious than gold which is tried by~
the fire) may be found unto praise and glory and honour at the appearing of~
Jesus Christ:
8 Whom having not seen, you love: in whom also now, though you see him not, you~
believe: and believing shall rejoice with joy unspeakable and glorified;
9 Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.
10 Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and diligently searched, who~
prophesied of the grace to come in you.
11 Searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ in them did~
signify: when it foretold those sufferings that are in Christ, and the glories~
that should follow:
12 To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to you they ministered~
those things which are now declared to you by them that have preached the gospel~
to you, the Holy Ghost being sent down from heaven, on whom the angels desire to~
look.

!1 Pet 1:13-21
13 Wherefore having the loins of your mind girt up, being sober, trust perfectly~
in the grace which is offered you in the revelation of Jesus Christ,
14 As children of obedience, not fashioned according to the former desires of~
your ignorance:
15 But according to him that hath called you, who is holy, be you also in all~
manner of conversation holy:
16 Because it is written: You shall be holy, for I am holy.
17 And if you invoke as Father him who, without respect of persons, judgeth~
according to every one's work: converse in fear during the time of your~
sojourning here.
18 Knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as gold or silver,~
from your vain conversation of the tradition of your fathers:
19 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb unspotted and undefiled,
20 Foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but manifested in the~
last times for you,
21 Who through him are faithful in God, who raised him up from the dead, and~
hath given him glory, that your faith and hope might be in God.

[Lectio4]
From the Book written by St Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, on belief in the~
Resurrection.
!After middle
Since it was impossible that the Wisdom of God could die, and that which could~
not die could not rise from the dead, He took to Himself Flesh Which could die,~
that That Whose nature it was to die might die, and rise again. Neither was it~
possible that the resurrection of the dead should come otherwise than by man,~
"for since by man came death, by Man came also the resurrection of the dead." (1~
Cor. xv. 21.) Man He rose since Man He died, the Manhood quickened but the~
Godhead Quickener. Man then, as touching the Flesh God now, over all things.~
For now we know Christ no longer after the Flesh, but we owe it to the Flesh~
that we know Him as "become the First-fruits of them that slept" (1 Cor. xv. 23)~
"and the First-begotten of the dead" (Apoc. i. 5.)

[Responsory4]
R. Bless ye God in the congregations Alleluia.
* Even the Lord, ye that are of the fountains of Israel Alleluia, Alleluia.
V. Sing forth the honour of His Name, make His praise glorious.
R. Even the Lord, ye that are of the fountains of Israel Alleluia, Alleluia.

[Lectio5]
The first-fruits are of the same kind and nature as the other fruits, and they~
are brought as an offering to God l to win His blessing on the in-gathering, an~
holy offering made on behalf of all, and as it were the homage of restored~
nature. Christ then is the First-fruits of them that sleep. But is He the~
First-fruits of only His own loved ones that fall asleep in Him, and lie as it~
were untouched by death, wrapt in a sweet slumber Or is He the First-fruits of~
all the dead? But "as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made~
alive." (1 Cor. xv. 22.) So that, as in Adam were the first-fruits of the death~
wherein all die, even so in Christ were the first-fruits of the resurrection,~
wherein all rise again. But let no man be hopeless, neither let it be a grief to~
the righteous to remember that to rise again will be common to all men, when he~
looketh for that day wherein the harvest of his life will nobly realise itself.~
All shall rise again, "but," as saith the Apostle (23,) "every man in his own~
order." The harvest of God's mercy will be for all, but in reward one man shall~
differ from another.

[Responsory5]
R. With my whole heart Alleluia have I sought thee Alleluia.
* O let me not wander from thy commandments Alleluia, Alleluia.
V. Blessed art Thou, O Lord teach me thy statutes.
R. O let me not wander from thy commandments Alleluia, Alleluia.

[Lectio6]
I tell you how grievous an outrage against God it is not to believe in the~
resurrection. If we shall Is this not rise again, then did Christ die in vain,~
then is Christ not risen For if [if He rose at all,] He rose for us, and if He~
had not us to rise for, then He is plainly not risen. In Him the world, in Him~
the heavens, in Him the earth rose again. For there shall be " a new heaven, and a~
new earth" (Apoc. xxi. 1.) For Himself He needed not to rise Whom the bands of~
death held not. For although He died as Man, yet was He free in the netherworld~
itself. Wouldest thou hear how free "I am as a man that hath no strength, free~
among the dead" (Ps. Ixxxvii. 6.) O how free Who was able to take up his life~
again at will (John x. 18), even as it is written that He said " Destroy this~
Temple, and in three days I will raise it up " (John ii. 19.) O how free Who~
descended into hell only to redeem others therefrom.

[Responsory6]
R. Sing us a song Alleluia.
* How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land Alleluia, Alleluia.
V. There they that carried us away captive required of us a song.
R. How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land Alleluia, Alleluia.

R. How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land Alleluia, Alleluia.

From the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 16:23-3
At that time Jesus said unto His disciples Amen, Amen, I say unto you~
Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in My Name, He will give it you. And so on.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop of Hippo.
!102nd Tract on Jonh.
We have now to consider these words of the Lord " Amen, Amen, I say unto you~
Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in My Name, He will give it you." It hath~
already been said in the earlier part of this discourse of the Lord, for the~
sake of some who ask the Father in Christ's Name and receive not, that~
whatsoever is asked, which tendeth not to salvation, is not asked in the Name of~
the Saviour. By the words "In My Name "we must not understand the vocalization~
of letters and syllables, but the meaning of what is said, the honest and true~
meaning.

[Responsory7]
R. I will sing a new song unto thee, O God Alleluia.
* Upon a psaltery of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee. Alleluia,~
Alleluia.
V. Thou art my God, and I will praise thee Thou art my God, and I will exalt~
thee.
R. Upon a psaltery of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee. Alleluia,~
Alleluia.

[Lectio8]
Therefore, whosoever thinketh of Christ as he ought not to think of the Only Son~
of God, such an one doth not ask anything in Christ's Name, although he do~
actually utter letters and syllables to that effect, because by these sounds he~
meaneth not the Real Christ, but a fancied being who hath no existence except in~
the speaker's imagination. But on the other hand, whosoever thinketh of Christ~
as he ought to think, the same asketh in Christ's Name, and receiveth, provided~
only it be nothing against his own everlasting salvation but if it is good for~
him to receive, he receiveth. Some things are not given at once, but kept over~
till a more fitting season. Such is the true interpretation of the words " He~
will give it you " namely, that those things will be given which are good for~
them to ask. All the Saints also are heard when they ask for themselves, but not~
necessarily when they ask for their friends, or their enemies, or others, even~
as it is written, not simply " He will give it " but "He will give it you."

[Responsory8]
R. It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord Alleluia
* And to sing praises Alleluia.
V. Upon an instrument of ten strings, upon the harp with a solemn sound.
R. And to sing praises Alleluia.
&Gloria
R. And to sing praises Alleluia.

[Lectio9]
Hitherto saith the Lord, have ye asked nothing in My Name ask, and ye shall~
receive, that your joy may be full." This their joy, whereof He saith that it~
shall be full, is to be understood not of fleshly but of spiritual joy and~
when that joy is so great that it can be increased no more, then shall it~
without doubt be full. Whatsoever therefore we ask for the fulfilling of this~
joy, (that is, if we thereby mean grace, if we ask for that life which is the~
really blessed one,) that is a thing which it is meet to ask in Christ's Name.~
If we ask anything else than this, we ask nothing, although we do actually ask~
something, because all things are nothing in comparison with this.

Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 16:23-3
16:23 And in that day you shall not ask me any thing. Amen, amen I say to you: if you ask the Father any thing in my name, he will give it you.
16:24 Hitherto you have not asked any thing in my name. Ask, and you shall receive; that your joy may be full.
16:25 These things I have spoken to you in proverbs. The hour cometh, when I will no more speak to you in proverbs, but will shew you plainly of the Father.
16:26 In that day you shall ask in my name; and I say not to you, that I will ask the Father for you:
16:27 For the Father himself loveth you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.
16:28 I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again I leave the world, and I go to the Father.
16:29 His disciples say to him: Behold, now thou speakest plainly, and speakest no proverb.
16:30 Now we know that thou knowest all things, and thou needest not that any man should ask thee. By this we believe that thou camest forth from God.
16:31 Jesus answered them: Do you now believe?
16:32 Behold, the hour cometh, and it is now come, that you shall be scattered every man to his own, and shall leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
16:33 These things I have spoken to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you shall have distress: but have confidence, I have overcome the world.
