[Hymnus Vespera]
O Jesu Life, spring of the soul!
The Father's power and glory bright!
thee with the Angels we extol;
From thee they draw their life and light.
_
thy thousand thousand hosts are spread
Embattled o'er the azure sky;
But Michael bears thy standard dread,
And lifts the mighty Cross on high.
_
He in that Sign the rebel power.
Did with their Dragon Prince expel;
And hurled them from the heaven.' high towers,
Down like a thunderbolt to hell.
_
Grant us, with Michael, still, Lord,
Against the prince of pride to fight;
So may a crown be our reward,
Before the Lamb's pure throne of light.
_
To God the Father, with the Son
And Holy Paraclete, with thee,
As evermore hath been before,
Be glory through eternity.
Ámen.

Olvasmány Dániel próféta könyvébõl
!Dan 7:9-11
9 Amint néztem, egyszer csak trónokat állítottak fel, és az Õsöreg leült. Ruhája fehér volt, mint a hó, fején a haj tiszta, mint a gyapjú. Trónja lobogó lángból volt, kerekei meg izzó parázsból.
10 Tûzfolyó eredt belõle és folyt tovább. Ezerszer ezren szolgáltak neki, és tízezerszer tízezren álltak elõtte. Ítéletet tartottak, és felnyitották a könyveket.
11 Aztán láttam az elbizakodott beszédek elhangzása után, amelyeket a szarv hirdetett, magam láttam, hogy megölték a vadállatot, testét darabokra vágták és tûzre vetették.

[Responsory1]
R. There was silence in heaven while the dragon fought against Michael the Archangel.
* I heard the voice of thousands of thousands, saying Salvation, and honour, and power unto God the Almighty. (Alleluia.)
V. Thousands of thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times hundreds of thousands stood before Him.
R. I heard the voice of thousands of thousands, saying Salvation, and honour, and power unto God, the Almighty. (Alleluia.)

[Lectio2]
!Dan 10:4-8
4 Az elsõ hónap huszonnegyedik napján a nagy folyam, vagyis a Tigris partján voltam.
5 Amikor körülnéztem, egyszerre egy gyolcsruhába öltözött férfit láttam. Derekát színarany övezte.
6 Teste ragyogott, mint a drágakõ, arca, mint a villám, szeme, mint a lobogó tûz, karja és lába, mint a csiszolt érc felülete, szavának hangja meg, mint a tömeg zúgása.
7 De csak én, Dániel, láttam ezt a látomást. A férfiak, akik velem voltak, nem látták a látomást, mert akkora félelem fogta el õket, hogy elfutottak és elrejtõztek.
8 Ahogy így magamra maradtam, s elõttem a nagy látomás: minden erõm elhagyott, arcom halálsápadt lett, s csaknem összeestem.

[Responsory2]
R. An Angel stood at the Altar of the temple, having a golden censer in his hand and there was given unto him much incense
* And the smoke of the incense ascended up before the Lord, out of the Angel's hand. (Alleluia.)
V. Before the Angels will I sing praise unto thee; I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy Name, O Lord.
R. And the smoke of the incense ascended up before the Lord, out of the Angel's hand. (Alleluia.)

[Lectio3]
!Dan 10:9-14
9 Amikor meghallottam a hangját, amint beszélt, szavának hallatára elájultam és elvágódtam arccal a föld felé.
10 Ekkor megérintett egy kéz, s térdemre és tenyeremre segített.
11 Majd azt mondta nekem: "Dániel, te kedvelt férfiú! Értsd meg a szavakat, amelyeket hozzád intézek! Állj fel, mert hozzád szól a küldetésem." Azután, hogy közölte velem ezeket a szavakat, remegve felálltam.
12 Ekkor így szólt hozzám: "Ne félj, Dániel! Mert az elsõ naptól fogva, amikor elhatároztad, hogy az igazság ismeretére törekedve vezekelsz a te Istened színe elõtt, könyörgésed meghallgatásra talált. Éppen a könyörgésed miatt kellett hozzád jönnöm.
13 A perzsák országának (angyal) fejedelme huszonegy napon át ellenállt nekem. De Mihály, az egyik legfõbb fejedelem, segítségemre jött. Ott is hagytam, hogy küzdjön meg a perzsák királyával,
14 magam pedig eljöttem, hogy tudtodra adjam: mi fog történni népeddel a végsõ napokban, mert a látomás azokról a napokról szól."

[Responsory3]
R. Before the Angels will I sing praise unto thee, and will worship toward thy holy temple

[Lectio4]
That the blessed Archangel Michael hath oftentimes been seen of men is attested on the authority of the Holy Bible, and also by the ancient traditions of the Saints. For this reason such visions are held in remembrance in many places. As of old time did the Synagogue of the Jews, so now doth the Church of God~
venerate Michael as her watcher and defender. But during the Popedom of Gelasius I. the summit of Mount Gargano in Apulia, at whose foot lieth the town of Siponto, was the scene of an extraordinary appearance of this same Archangel Michael.

[Responsory4]
R. This is Michael, who to battle leads the armies of the skies
* Whosoever on him calleth blessed within his wardship lies. His a prayer whose voice availing aids from earth toward heaven to rise. (Alleluia.)
V. The Archangel Michael is the Vice-Roy of Paradise, and the Angels that are the dwellers therein, do hold him in worship.
R. Whosoever on him calleth blessed within his wardship lies. His a prayer whose voice availing aids from earth toward heaven to rise. (Alleluia.)

[Lectio5]
And it came to pass on this wise. A certain man had a bull grazing with the flock upon Mount Gargano, and it strayed. And when they had sought it for a long while they found it jammed in the mouth of a cavern. Then one that stood there shot an arrow at it to slay it, but the arrow turned round and came back against him that had shot it. They therefore that saw it, and all those that heard it, were sore afraid because of that which had come to pass, so that no man dared any more to draw near to the cavern. But when they had sought counsel of the Bishop of Siponto, he answered, that it behoved to seek the interpretation from God, and proclaimed three days of fasting and prayer.

[Responsory5]
R. Where Angels lead the spirits of the blessed dead the glad procession moves with Michael at its head
* To lead them into the garden of Eden. (Alleluia.)
V. Lord, send thy Holy Spirit from heaven the Spirit of wisdom and understanding.
R. To lead them into the garden of Eden. (Alleluia.)

[Lectio6]
After three days the Archangel Michael gave warning to the Bishop that that place was under his protection, and that he had thus pointed out by a sign that he wished that worship should be offered to God there, with remembrance of himself and of the Angels. Then the Bishop and the citizens made haste and came to the cavern and when they found that the form thereof was somewhat after the fashion of a Church, they began to perform the public worship of God therein which sanctuary hath been glorified with many miracles. It was not long after these things that Pope~
Boniface IV. hallowed the Church of St Michael on Hadrian's Mole at Rome, on the 29th day of September, on the which day the Church also holdeth in remembrance All Angels. But this present day is hallowed in remembrance of the manifestation of the Archangel Michael.

[Responsory6]
R. At that time shall Michael stand up, which standeth for your children.
* And there shall be a time, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time. (Alleluia)
V. At that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the Book of Life.
R. And there shall be a time, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time. (Alleluia)
&Gloria
R. And there shall be a time, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time. (Alleluia)

[Lectio7]
From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 18:1-10
At that time Came the disciples unto Jesus, saying Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? And so on. 
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Bk. iii. Comm. on Matth. xviii.
After the finding of the piece of money in the fish's mouth, after the payment of the tribute, what meaneth this sudden question of the Apostles? Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? They had seen that the same tribute-money was paid for Peter as for the Lord, and from this equality of reckoning they gathered that Peter was Prince of all the Apostles, seeing that he had been~
appraised at the same price as his Master. Therefore they ask, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? And Jesus, seeing their thoughts, and understanding wherefore they erred, is fain to take away the desire of glory by the love of lowliness.

[Responsory7]
R. Be not ye afraid before the Gentiles but in your hearts, worship ye the Lord, and fear Him
* For His Angel is with you. (Alleluia.)
V. An Angel stood at the Altar of the Temple, having a golden censer in his hand.
R. For His Angel is with you. (Alleluia.)

[Lectio8]
Therefore, if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee for it must needs be that offences come, but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!  because by his sin he maketh, and maketh to be his own work, that which must needs be in the world. Away, then, with every affection and every kinship, lest thy love should throw a stumbling-block before a single~
believer. Be there any, saith He, who is as near to thee as thine hand, thy foot, or thine eye, useful, careful, far - seeing, but who layeth a stumbling-block before thee, and whose diverse way of life may draw thee to hell it is better for thee to lose such an one and thy worldly happiness with him, than to live surrounded by them that are near and needful to thee, and to pile up unto thyself damnation.

[Responsory8]
R. The Archangel Michael came to help God's people.
* He arose to succour the spirits of the righteous. (Alleluia.)
V. An Angel stood at the Altar of the Temple, having a golden censer in his hand.
R. He arose to succour the spirits of the righteous. (Alleluia.)
&Gloria
R. He arose to succour the spirits of the righteous. (Alleluia.)

[Lectio9]
I say unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of My~
Father. Above, He had said that every tie of kinship or of convenience which might become a stumbling-block, albeit close and needful as hand, or foot, or eye, was to be cut off, but here He softeneth the hardness of that precept Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones. Hardness, saith He, I command not save as teaching tenderness withal; in heaven their Angels do always~
behold the face of My Father. Oh, how great is the dignity of souls, whereof every one hath from its birth an Angel appointed to guard it! Hence, we read in the Revelation of John Unto the Angel of the Church of Ephesus, (and so of the others,) write, (ii. I, &c.) And the Apostle (Paul) also saith The woman (that is, in the Church) ought to have a covering on her head, because of the~
Angels, (i Cor. xi. 10.) The Hy7nn, We praise thee, O God, &c, is said.
