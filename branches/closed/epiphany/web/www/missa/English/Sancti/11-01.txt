Lesson from the book of Revelations
!Apoc 7:2-12
In those days, behold, I John, saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God; and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, who had it in their power to harm the earth and the sea, saying, Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads. And I heard the number of those who were sealed, a hundred and forty-four thousand sealed, out of every tribe of the children of Israel; of the tribe of Juda, twelve thousand sealed; of the tribe of Ruben, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Aser, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Nephthali, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Manasses, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Zabulon, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand sealed. After this I saw a great multitude which no man could number, out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, and with palms in their hands. And they cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation belongs to our God Who sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb. And all the angels were standing round about the throne, and the elders and the four living creatures; and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshipped God, saying, Amen. Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and strength to our God forever and ever. Amen.

Blessed are the poor is spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are~
the meek, for they shall possess the earth. Blessed are they who mourn, for they~
shall be comforted. Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for justice, for they~
shall be satisfied. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.~
Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall see God. Blessed are the~
peacemakers for they shall be called children of God. Blessed are they who~
suffer persecution for justice’ sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.~

say all manner of evil against you, for My sake. Rejoice and exult, because your~
reward is great in heaven.
