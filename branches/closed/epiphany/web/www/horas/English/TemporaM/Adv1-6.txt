Lesson from the book of Isaias
!Isa 7:1-3
1 And it came to pass in the days of Achaz the son of Joathan, the son of Ozias,~
king of Juda, that Basin king of Syria, and Phacee the son of Romelia king of~
Israel, came up to Jerusalem, to fight against it: but they could not prevail~
over it.
2 And they told the house of David, saying: Syria hath rested upon Ephraim, and~
his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the woods are~
moved with the wind.
3 And the Lord said to Isaias: Go forth to meet Achaz, thou and Jasub thy son~
that is left, to the conduit of the upper pool, a in the way of the fuller's~
held.

!Isa 7:4-6
4 And thou shalt say to him: See thou be quiet: fear not, and let not thy heart~
be afraid of the two tails of these fire brands, smoking with the wrath of the~
fury of Rasin king of Syria, end of the son of Romelia.
5 Because Syria hath taken counsel against thee, unto the evil of Ephraim and~
the son of Romelia, saying:
6 Let us go up to Juda, and rouse it up, and draw it away to us, and make the~
son of Tabeel king in the midst thereof.

!Isa 7:10-15
10 And the Lord spoke again to Achaz, saying:
11 Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God either unto the depth of hell, or unto~
the height above.
12 And Achaz said: I will not ask, and I will not tempt the Lord.
13 And he said: Hear ye therefore, O house of David: Is it a small thing for you~
to be grievous to men, that you are grievous to my God also?
14 Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign. Behold a virgin shall~
conceive, and bear a son, and his name shall be called Emmanuel.
15 He shall eat butter and honey, that he may know to refuse the evil, and to~
choose the good.
