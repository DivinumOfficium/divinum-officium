26:1 (The psalm of David before he was anointed.) The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear? The Lord is the protector of my life: of whom shall I be afraid?
26:2 Whilst the wicked draw near against me, to eat my flesh. My enemies that trouble me, have themselves been weakened, and have fallen.
26:3 If armies in camp should stand together against me, my heart shall not fear. If a battle should rise up against me, in this will I be confident.
26:4 One thing I have asked of the Lord, this will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life. That I may see the delight of the Lord, and may visit his temple.
26:5 For he hath hidden me in his tabernacle; in the day of evils, he hath protected me in the secret place of his tabernacle.
26:6 He hath exalted me upon a rock: and now he hath lifted up my head above my enemies. I have gone round, and have offered up in his tabernacle a sacrifice of jubilation: I will sing, and recite a psalm to the Lord.
26:7 Hear, O Lord, my voice, with which I have cried to thee: have mercy on me and hear me.
26:8 My heart hath said to thee: My face hath sought thee: thy face, O Lord, will I still seek.
26:9 Turn not away thy face from me; decline not in thy wrath from thy servant. Be thou my helper, forsake me not; do not thou despise me, O God my Saviour.
26:10 For my father and my mother have left me: but the Lord hath taken me up.
26:11 Set me, O Lord, a law in thy way, and guide me in the right path, because of my enemies.
26:12 Deliver me not over to the will of them that trouble me; for unjust witnesses have risen up against me; and iniquity hath lied to itself.
26:13 I believe to see the good things of the Lord in the land of the living.
26:14 Expect the Lord, do manfully, and let thy heart take courage, and wait thou for the Lord.
