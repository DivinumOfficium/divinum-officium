49:1 (A psalm for Asaph.) The God of gods, the Lord hath spoken: and he hath called the earth. From the rising of the sun, to the going down thereof:
49:2 Out of Sion the loveliness of his beauty.
49:3 God shall come manifestly: our God shall come, and shall not keep silence. A fire shall burn before him: and a mighty tempest shall be round about him.
49:4 He shall call heaven from above, and the earth, to judge his people.
49:5 Gather ye together his saints to him: who set his covenant before sacrifices.
49:6 And the heavens shall declare his justice: for God is judge.
49:7 Hear, O my people, and I will speak: O Israel, and I will testify to thee: I am God, thy God.
49:8 I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices: and thy burnt offerings are always in my sight.
49:9 I will not take calves out of thy house: nor he goats out of thy flocks.
49:10 For all the beasts of the woods are mine: the cattle on the hills, and the oxen.
49:11 I know all the fowls of the air: and with me is the beauty of the field.
49:12 If I should be hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.
49:13 Shall I eat the flesh of bullocks? or shall I drink the blood of goats?
49:14 Offer to God the sacrifice of praise: and pay thy vows to the most High.
49:15 And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.
49:16 But to the sinner God hath said: Why dost thou declare my justices, and take my covenant in thy mouth?
49:17 Seeing thou hast hated discipline: and hast cast my words behind thee.
49:18 If thou didst see a thief thou didst run with him: and with adulterers thou hast been a partaker.
49:19 Thy mouth hath abounded with evil, and thy tongue framed deceits.
49:20 Sitting thou didst speak against thy brother, and didst lay a scandal against thy mother's son:
49:21 These things hast thou done, and I was silent. Thou thoughtest unjustly that I should be like to thee: but I will reprove thee, and set before thy face.
49:22 Understand these things, you that forget God; lest he snatch you away, and there be none to deliver you.
49:23 The sacrifice of praise shall glorify me: and there is the way by which I will shew him the salvation of God.
