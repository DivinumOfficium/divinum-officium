35:1 (Unto the end, for the servant of God, David himself.)
35:2 The unjust hath said within himself, that he would sin: there is no fear of God before his eyes.
35:3 For in his sight he hath done deceitfully, that his iniquity may be found unto hatred.
35:4 The words of his mouth are iniquity and guile: he would not understand that he might do well.
35:5 He hath devised iniquity on his bed, he hath set himself on every way that is not good: but evil he hath not hated.
35:6 O Lord, thy mercy is in heaven, and thy truth reacheth even to the clouds.
35:7 Thy justice is as the mountains of God, thy judgments are a great deep. Men and beasts thou wilt preserve, O Lord:
35:8 O how hast thou multiplied thy mercy, O God! But the children of men shall put their trust under the covert of thy wings.
35:9 They shall be inebriated with the plenty of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the torrent of thy pleasure.
35:10 For with thee is the fountain of life; and in thy light we shall see light.
35:11 Extend thy mercy to them that know thee, and thy justice to them that are right in heart.
35:12 Let not the foot of pride come to me, and let not the hand of the sinner move me.
35:13 There the workers of iniquity are fallen, they are cast out, and could not stand.
