113:1 When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a barbarous people: 
113:2 Judea made his sanctuary, Israel his dominion. 
113:3 The sea saw and fled: Jordan was turned back. 
113:4 The mountains skipped like rams, and the hills like the lambs of the flock. 
113:5 What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou didst flee: and thou, O Jordan, that thou wast turned back?
113:6 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams, and ye hills, like lambs of the flock? 
113:7 At the presence of the Lord the earth was moved, at the presence of the God of Jacob: 
113:8 Who turned the rock into pools of water, and the stony hill into fountains of waters. 
113:9 Not to us, O Lord, not to us; but to thy name give glory. 
113:10 For thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake: lest the gentiles should say: Where is their God?
113:11 But our God is in heaven: he hath done all things whatsoever he would. 
113:12 The idols of the gentiles are silver and gold, the works of the hands of men. 
113:13 They have mouths and speak not: they have eyes and see not. 
113:14 They have ears and hear not: they have noses and smell not. 
113:15 They have hands and feel not: they have feet and walk not: neither shall they cry out through their throat.
113:16 Let them that make them become like unto them: and all such as trust in them. 
113:17 The house of Israel hath hoped in the Lord: he is their helper and their protector. 
113:18 The house of Aaron hath hoped in the Lord: he is their helper and their protector. 
113:19 They that fear the Lord hath hoped in the Lord: he is their helper and their protector. 
113:20 The Lord hath been mindful of us, and hath blessed us. He hath blessed the house of Israel: he hath blessed the house of Aaron.
113:21 He hath blessed all that fear the Lord, both little and great. 
113:22 May the Lord add blessings upon you: upon you, and upon your children. 
113:23 Blessed be you of the Lord, who made heaven and earth. 
113:24 The heaven of heaven is the Lord's: but the earth he has given to the children of men. 
113:25 The dead shall not praise thee, O Lord: nor any of them that go down to hell.
113:26 But we that live bless the Lord: from this time now and for ever.
