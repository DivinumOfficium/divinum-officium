54:1 Hear, O God, my prayer, and despise not my supplication: * be attentive to me and hear me.
54:2 I am grieved in my exercise; * and am troubled, at the voice of the enemy, and at the tribulation of the sinner.
54:3 For they have cast iniquities upon me; * and in wrath they were troublesome to me.
54:4 My heart is troubled within me: * and the fear of death is fallen upon me.
54:5 Fear and trembling are come upon me: * and darkness hath covered me.
54:6 And I said: Who will give me wings like a dove, * and I will fly and be at rest?
54:7 Lo, I have gone far off flying away; * and I abode in the wilderness.
54:8 I waited for him that hath saved me * from pusillanimity of spirit, and a storm.
54:9 Cast down, O Lord, and divide their tongues; * for I have seen iniquity and contradiction in the city.
54:10 Day and night shall iniquity surround it upon its walls: * and in the midst thereof are labour, and injustice.
54:11 And usury and deceit * have not departed from its streets.
54:12 For if my enemy had reviled me, * I would verily have borne with it.
54:13 And if he that hated me had spoken great things against me, * I would perhaps have hidden myself from him.
54:14 But thou a man of one mind, * my guide, and my familiar.
54:15 Who didst take sweetmeats together with me: * in the house of God we walked with consent.
54:16 Let death come upon them, * and let them go down alive into hell.
54:16 For there is wickedness in their dwellings: * in the midst of them.
54:17 But I have cried to God: * and the Lord will save me.
54:18 Evening and morning, and at noon I will speak and declare: * and he shall hear my voice.
54:19 He shall redeem my soul in peace from them that draw near to me: * for among many they were with me.
54:20 God shall hear, * and the Eternal shall humble them.
54:21 For there is no change with them, and they have not feared God: * he hath stretched forth his hand to repay.
54:22 They have defiled his covenant, they are divided by the wrath of his countenance, * and his heart hath drawn near.
54:23 His words are smoother than oil, * and the same are darts.
54:24 Cast thy care upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee: * he shall not suffer the just to waver for ever.
54:24 But thou, O God, shalt bring them down * into the pit of destruction.
54:24 Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; * but I will trust in thee, O Lord.
