(Canticum Ecclesiaticae * Eccli 31:8-11)
31:8 Blessed is the rich man that is found without blemish: and that hath not gone after gold, nor put his trust in money nor in treasures.
31:9 Who is he, and we will praise him? for he hath done wonderful things in his life.
31:10 Who hath been tried thereby, and made perfect, he shall have glory everlasting. He that could have transgressed, and hath not transgressed: and could do evil things, and hath not done them:
31:11 Therefore are his goods established in the Lord, and all the church of the saints shall declare his alms.
