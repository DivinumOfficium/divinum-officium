45:1 Our God is our refuge and strength: * a helper in troubles, which have found us exceedingly.
45:2 Therefore we will not fear, when the earth shall be troubled; * and the mountains shall be removed into the heart of the sea.
45:3 Their waters roared and were troubled: * the mountains were troubled with his strength.
45:4 The stream of the river maketh the city of God joyful: * the most High hath sanctified his own tabernacle.
45:5 God is in the midst thereof, it shall not be moved: * God will help it in the morning early.
45:6 Nations were troubled, and kingdoms were bowed down: * he uttered his voice, the earth trembled. 
45:7 The Lord of armies is with us: * the God of Jacob is our protector.
45:8 Come and behold ye the works of the Lord: what wonders he hath done upon earth, * making wars to cease even to the end of the earth.
45:9 He shall destroy the bow, and break the weapons: * and the shield he shall burn in the fire.
45:10 Be still and see that I am God; * I will be exalted among the nations, and I will be exalted in the earth. 
45:11 The Lord of armies is with us: * the God of Jacob is our protector.
