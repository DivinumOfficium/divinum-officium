[Oratio]
O God, Who hast been pleased to set before us in thy blessed Confessor Peter a~
wondrous ensample of penance and of a mind unfathomably rapt in thee, let, we~
beseech thee, the same thy servant pray for us, and him do Thou accept, that we~
may so die unto earthly things, as to take lively hold on heavenly things.

[Lectio4]
Peter was born at Alcantara, (a small town in the Province of Estramadura,) in~
Spain, (in the year of our Lord 1499.) His father, (Alphonso Garavito, was a~
lawyer and Governor of the town,) and his mother (was) of good extraction. The~
holiness of his life was foreshadowed from his earliest years. In the sixteenth~
year of his age he entered the Order of Friars Minor, wherein he showed himself a~
pattern to all. He undertook the work of preaching in obedience to his Superiors,~
and thereby brought many to turn away from sin to true repentance. He conceived a~
great desire to bring back the observance of the Rule of St Francis to the~
uttermost straitness of old times, and to that end, supported by God's help, and~
armed with the approval of the Apostolic See, he founded (in the year 1555) a~
new stern and poor house near Pedraso, from which the harder way of life,~
therein happily begun, spread marvellously through divers Provinces of Spain~
even to the Indies. He was an helper to holy Theresa, with whom he was~
like-minded, in bringing about the Reformation of the Carmelites. She was taught~
of God that no one should ask anything in the name of Peter without being heard,~
and was used to ask him to pray for her, and to call him a Saint while as he was~
yet alive.

[Lectio5]
He humbly excused himself from accepting the courtesies of princes, by whom his~
advice was sought as that of an oracle, and declined to become the Confessor of~
the Emperor Charles V. He was a very careful keeper to poverty, and contented~
himself with a single tunic than which none was worse. Purity he carried to such a~
point that when he was lying sick of his last illness, he would not allow the~
brother who ministered to him to touch him, how lightly soever. He brought his~
body into bondage by unceasing watching, fasting, scourging, cold, nakedness,~
and all manner of hardships, having made it a promise never to allow it any rest~
in this world. The love of God and his neighbour, which was shed abroad in his~
heart, somewhiles burnt so that he was fain to run from his cell into the open~
air to cool himself.

[Lectio6]
He was marvellous how his thoughts became altogether rapt in God, so that~
somewhiles it befell that he neither ate nor drank for the space of several~
days. He was oftentimes seen to rise into the air, shining with an unearthly~
glory. He passed dry-shod over torrents. When his brethren were in the last~
state of need, he fed them with food from heaven. A staff which he fixed in the~
earth grew presently into a green fig-tree. Once while he was travelling by~
night in the midst of an heavy snow-storm, and took refuge in a ruined and~
roofless house, then the falling snow made a roof over him lest he should be~
overwhelmed. Holy Theresa beareth witness that he had the gift of prophecy and~
of the discerning of spirits. At length, in the 63rd year of his own age, (and~
of salvation 1562,) at the hour which he had himself foretold, (upon the 18th~
day of October,) he passed away to be for ever with the Lord, cheered in his~
last moments by a wonderful vision and by the presence of Saints. At the instant~
of his death, blessed Theresa, then afar off, saw him carried to heaven. He~
appeared to her afterwards, and said O what happy penance, to have won for me~
such glory! After his death he became famous for very many miracles, and~
Clement IX. inscribed his name among those of the Saints.

[Lectio94]
Born of noble parents at Alcantara in Spain, Peter entered the Order of Friars minor when he was sixteen. He showed himself a model of all virtues, especially powerty and chastity, and brought numberless men from vice to repentance, by preaching the word of God. Eager to restore the original observance of St Francis, he built a very small and very poor monastery near Pedroso. The way of life there was of the strictest, and from this auspicious beginning it spread in a remarkable way. He was a help to St Teresa in promoting the Carmelite reform, having approved the spirit in which she begun it. Teresa often referred to him as a saint even while he was still living; and we learn from her, that he was famous for the grace of contemplation and miracles, and was imbued with the gift of prophecy and of the discernment of spirits. Finally he went to heaven in his sixty-third year, and blessed Teresa saw him in vision, shining with wonderful glory.
