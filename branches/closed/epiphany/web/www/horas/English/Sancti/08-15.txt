Lesson from the book of Canticles
!Song 1:1-4
1 Let him kiss me with the kiss of his mouth: for thy breasts are better than~
wine,
2 Smelling sweet of the best ointments. thy name is as oil poured out: therefore~
young maidens have loved thee.
3 Draw me: we will run after thee to the odour of thy ointments. The king hath~
brought me into his storerooms: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, remembering~
thy breasts more than wine: the righteous love thee.
4 I am black but beautiful, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Cedar,~
as the curtains of Solomon.

[Responsory1]
R. I saw her, when, fair like a dove, she winged her flight above the rivers of~
waters. The priceless savour of her perfumes hung heavy in her garments.
* And about her it was as the flower of roses in the spring of the year, and~
lilies of the valleys. 
V. Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like a pillar of smoke,~
perfumed with myrrh and frankincense? 
R. And about her it was as the flower of roses in the spring of the year, and~
lilies of the valleys.

[Lectio2]
!Song 1:5-9
5 Do not consider me that I am brown, because the sun hath altered my colour:~
the sons of my mother have fought against me, they have made me the keeper in~
the vineyards: my vineyard I have not kept.
6 show me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou liest in~
the midday, lest I begin to wander after the flocks of thy companions.
7 If thou know not thyself, O fairest among women, go forth, and follow after~
the steps of the flocks, and feed thy kids beside the tents of the shepherds.
8 To my company of horsemen, in Pharao's chariots, have I likened thee, O my~
love.
9 thy cheeks are beautiful as the turtledove's, thy neck as jewels.

[Responsory2]
R. I was exalted like a cedar in Lebanon, and as a cypress-tree upon Mount Zion.~
Like the best myrrh
* I yielded a pleasant odour.
V. Like cinnamon and sweet balsam.
R. I yielded a pleasant odour.

[Lectio3]
!Song 1:10-16
10 We will make thee chains of gold, inlaid with silver.
11 While the king was at his repose, my spikenard sent forth the odour thereof.
12 A bundle of myrrh is my beloved to me, he shall abide between my breasts.
13 A cluster of cypress my love is to me, in the vineyards of Engaddi.
14 Behold thou art fair, O my love, behold thou art fair, thy eyes are as those~
of doves.

[Lectio4]
From the Sermons of St John of Damascus.
!2nd on the Falling-on-sleep of Blessed Mary.
This day the holy and animated Ark of the living God, which had held within it~
its own Maker, is borne to rest in that Temple of the Lord, which is not made~
with hands. David, whence it sprang, leapeth before it, and in company with~
him the Angels dance, the Archangels sing aloud, the Virtues ascribe glory, the~
Princedoms shout for joy, the Powers make merry, the Lordships rejoice, the~
Thrones keep holiday, the Cherubim utter praise, and the Seraphim proclaim its~
glory. This day the Eden of the new Adam receiveth the living garden of delight,~
wherein the condemnation was annulled, wherein the Tree of Life was planted,~
wherein our nakedness was covered.

[Responsory4]
R. When the Lord beheld the daughter of Jerusalem adorned with her jewels, He~
greatly desired her beauty
* And when the daughters of Zion saw her, they cried out that she was most~
blessed, saying thy name is as ointment poured forth.
V. Upon thy right hand did stand the Queen in a vesture of gold wrought about~
with divers colours.
R. And when the daughters of Zion saw her, they cried out that she was most~
blessed, saying thy name is as ointment poured forth.

[Lectio5]
This day the stainless maiden, who had been defiled by no earthly lust, but~
ermobled by heavenly desires, returned not to dust, but, being herself a living~
heaven, took her place among the heavenly mansions. From her true life had~
flowed for all men, and how should she taste of death? But she yielded obedience~
to the law established by Him to Whom she had given birth, and, as the daughter~
of the old Adam, underwent the old sentence, which even her Son, Who is the very~
Life Itself, had not refused; but, as the Mother of the living God, she was~
worthily taken by Him unto Himself.

[Responsory5]
R. All generations shall call me blessed. For
* He That is Mighty, even the Lord, hath done to me great things; and Holy is~
His Name.
V. And His mercy is on them that fear Him, from generation to generation.
R. He That is Mighty, even the Lord, hath done to me great things; and Holy is~
His Name.

[Lectio6]
Eve, who had said yea to the proposals of the serpent, was condemned to the~
pains of travail and the punishment of death, and found her place in the bowels~
of the Netherworld. But this truly blessed being who had inclined her ears to~
the word of God, whose womb had been filled by the action of the Holy Ghost, who,~
as soon as she heard the spiritual salutation of the archangel, had conceived~
the Son of God without any sexual pleasure or carnal knowledge by a man, who had~
brought forth her Offspring without any the least pang, who had hallowed herself~
altogether for the service of God how was death ever to feed upon her? how was~
the grave ever to eat her up? how was corruption to break into that body into~
which Life had been welcomed? For her there was a straight, smooth, and easy way~
to heaven. For if Christ, Who is the Life and the Truth, hath said Where I am,~
there shall also My servant be how much more shall not rather His mother be with~
Him?

[Responsory6]
R. Blessed art thou, O Virgin Mary, who hast carried the Lord, the Maker of the~
world.
* Thou hast borne Him Who created thee, and thou abidest a virgin for ever.
V. Hail, Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee.
R. Thou hast borne Him Who created thee, and thou abidest a virgin for ever.
&Gloria
R. Thou hast borne Him Who created thee, and thou abidest a virgin for ever.

[Lectio7]
From the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 10:38-42
At that time Jesus entered into a certain village, and a woman named Martha~
received Him into her house. And so on.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!27th on the Words of the Lord.
When the Holy Gospel was read, we heard how that a godly woman hospitably~
received the Lord into her house, and that this woman's name was Martha. And~
while Martha herself was cumbered about much serving, a sister of her's, called~
Mary, sat at the Lord's Feet, and heard His word. The one worked, the other was~
idle. One ministered, the other was filled. Nevertheless, Martha, working hard~
in the bustle and business of the serving, came to the Lord, and made complaint~
of her sister, because she would not help her in her work.

[Responsory7]
R. Grace is poured into thy lips
* Therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.
V. thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces~
whereby kings' daughters among thy honourable women have made thee glad.
R. Therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.

[Lectio8]
But the Lord undertook to answer Martha for Mary; He, Who had been called upon~
to be her Judge, became her Advocate. And Jesus answered and said unto her~
Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things. But one thing~
is needful, and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away~
from her. We have heard both the complaint, and the sentence of the Judge, the~
which sentence replieth to the complainant, and shieldeth her whom the Lord had~
received. Mary was wrapped up in the sweetness of the word of the Lord. Martha~
was busied how to feed the Lord, and Mary, how to be fed by the Lord. Martha was~
getting ready a banquet for that same Lord, at Whose banquet Mary was already~
revelling.

[Responsory8]
R. O Virgin Mary, Mother of God, blessed art thou that didst believe the Lord,~
for there hath been a performance of those things which were told thee from the~
Lord. Behold, thou art exalted over choirs of Angels.
* Plead for us with the Lord our God.
V. Hail, Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.
R. Plead for us with the Lord our God.
&Gloria
R. Plead for us with the Lord our God.

[Lectio9]
When, then, Mary was listening in peace and gentleness to those words of~
unutterable sweetness, and being feasted to the full extent of her heart's power,~
and Martha came and complained of her to the Lord, how must we imagine that she~
feared, lest the Lord should say unto her Arise, and help thy sister? She was~
held by that wondrous sweetness the smack whereof is felt more by the mind than~
by the belly. She was excused, and she sat all the safer. But on what grounds~
was she excused? Let us now turn our attention to this point, and thoroughly see~
into and examine it as far as we can, that we also may be fed.
