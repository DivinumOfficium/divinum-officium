   COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">, issued by the Congregation
  of Rites, September 26, 1964, established a number of adaptations
  for introduction into the sacred rites. These adaptations, the
  first fruits of the general liturgical reform called for by the
  conciliar </FONT><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial"><B><A HREF="SacrosanctumConcilium.html">Constitution
  on the Liturgy</A></B></font><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">,
  took effect on March 7, 1965.</FONT></P>
			<P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">Their rich yield
  is becoming quite clear from the many reports of bishops, which
  attest to an increased, more aware, and intense participation
  of the faithful everywhere in the liturgy, especially in the
  holy sacrifice of the Mass.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">To increase this
  participation even more and to make the liturgical rites, especially
  the Mass, clearer and better understood, the same bishops have
  proposed certain other adaptations. Submitted first to the Consilium,
  the proposals have undergone careful examination and discussion
  by the Consilium and the Congregation of Rites.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">At least for
  the moment, not every proposal can be sanctioned. Others, however,
  do seem worth putting into effect immediately, because pastoral
  considerations commend them and they seem to offer no hindrance
  to the definitive reform of the liturgy yet to come. Further,
  they seem advantageous for the gradual introduction of that reform
  and are feasible simply by altering rubrics, not the existing
  liturgical books.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">On this occasion
  it seems necessary to recall to everyone's mind that capital
  principle of Church discipline which the Constitution on the
  Liturgy solemnly confirmed. &quot;Regulation of the liturgy depends
  solely on the authority of the Church. Therefore, no other person,
  not even a priest, may on his own add, take away, or change anything
  in the liturgy&quot; (</FONT><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial"><B><I><A

  2-3).</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">Ordinaries, both
  local and religious, should therefore be mindful of their grave
  duty before the Lord to watch carefully over observance of this
  norm, so important for Church life and order. All ministers of
  sacred rites as well as all the faithful should also willingly
  conform to it.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">Individual spiritual
  growth and well-being demand this, as do harmonious cooperation
  in the Lord and mutual good example among the faithful in any
  local community. It is required also by the serious responsibility
  of each community to cooperate for the good of the Church throughout
  the world, especially today when the good or evil that develops
  in local communities quickly has an impact on the fabric of the
  whole family of God.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">All should heed
  the warning of the Apostle: &quot;For God is not a God of discord
  but of peace&quot; (I Cor 14:33).</FONT></P>
			<P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">The following
  adaptations and changes are instituted to achieve the more specific
  actualization and measured progress of the liturgical reform.</FONT></P>

			<p><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">
  1. Outside Lent, on days of class III, the Mass either of the
  office of the day or of the commemoration made at morning prayer
  may be celebrated. If the second is chosen, the color of the
  office of the day may be used, in keeping with the <I>Codex rubricarum
  </I>no. 323.</FONT></p>
			<P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">2. Once the conference
  of bishops in its own region has sanctioned an order of readings
  for weekdays in Masses with a congregation this may also be used
  for Masses celebrated without a congregation and the readings
  may be in the vernacular.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">This order of
  readings for weekdays may be used on certain days of class II,
  to be indicated in the Lectionary itself, and in all Masses of
  class III and IV, whether Masses of the season or of saints,
  or votive Masses not having their own, strictly proper readings,
  that is, those that mention the mystery or person being celebrated.</FONT></P>
			<P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">3. On weekdays
  in Ordinary Time, in the celebration of the Mass of the Sunday
  preceding, one of the Prayers for Various Needs or an opening
  prayer from the votive Masses for Various Needs may be taken
  from the Missal to replace the prayer of the Sunday Mass.</FONT></P>

  in the Mass</FONT></B></P>
			<P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">4. In the Mass
  only one prayer is to be said; depending on the rubrics, however,
  there is added before the single conclusion:</FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">a. the prayer
    proper to a rite (<I>Codex rubricarum</I> no. 447);<BR>

    religious, displacing the Mass of the day (<I>Rubr. spec.</I>

    the prayer from the votive Mass <I>Pro sponsis</I> displaced

    <P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">b. the prayer
    from the votive Mass of thanksgiving (<I>Codex rubricarum</I>

    the prayer for the anniversaries of the pope and the bishop (<I>Codex

    the prayer for the anniversary of the priest's own ordination
    (<I>Codex rubricarum</I> nos. 451-452).</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">5. If in the
  same Mass several prayers were to be required before the single
  conclusion, the only one added is the one most in keeping with
  the celebration.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">6. Instead of
  an imperated prayer, the bishop may insert one or more intentions
  for particular needs into the general intercessions.</FONT></P>
			<P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">In them by decree
  of the conference of bishops intentions also may be included
  for civil rulers (now used in various forms in the different
  countries) and special intentions for the particular needs of
  a nation or region.</FONT></P>

  sing those parts of the Canon that the rite for concelebration
  allows.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">11. In the Canon,
  the celebrant:</FONT></P>

    <I>Te igitur</I> standing erect and with hands outstretched;</FONT></P>

    sign of the cross over the offerings at the words <I>benedicas

    cross over the offerings.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">12. After the
  Consecration, the celebrant need not join thumb and forefinger;
  should any particle of the host have remained on his fingers,
  he rubs his fingers together over the paten.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">13. The communion
  rite for priest and people is to have the following arrangement:
  after he says <I>Panem caelestem accipiam</I>, the celebrant
  takes the Host and, facing the people, raises it, saying the
  <I>Ecce Agnus Dei</I>, then adding three times with the people
  the <I>Domine, non sum dignus</I>. He then communicates himself
  with the Host and chalice and immediately distributes communion
  in the usual way to the people.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">14. The faithful
  receiving communion at the chrism Mass on Holy Thursday may receive
  again at the evening Mass on the same day.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">15. A Mass celebrated
  with a congregation should include, according to circumstances,
  either a period of silence or the singing or recitation of a
  Psalm or Canticle of praise, e.g., Ps 33 [34], I will bless the
  Lord, Ps 150, Praise the Lord in his sanctuary or the Canticle
  Bless the Lord [Dn 3:35] or Blessed are you, O Lord [1 Chr 29:10].</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">16. At the end
  of Mass the blessing of the people comes immediately before the
  dismissal. It is recommended that the priest recite the <I>Placeat</I>
  silently as he is leaving the altar.</FONT></P>
			<P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">Even Masses for
  the dead include the blessing and usual dismissal formulary,
  <I>Ite, Missa est</I>, unless the absolution follows immediately;
  in this case, omitting the blessing, the celebrant says: <I>Benedicamus
  Domino</I> and proceeds to the absolution.</FONT></P>

  Cases</FONT></B></P>
			<P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">17. In nuptial
  Masses the celebrant says the prayers <I>Propitiare</I> and <I>Deus</I>,
  <I>qui potestate</I> not between the <I>Pater noster </I>and
  its embolism, but after the breaking of Bread and the commingling,
  just before the <I>Agnus Dei</I>.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">In a Mass celebrated
  facing the people the celebrant, after the commingling and a
  genuflection, may go to the bride and groom and say the prayers
  just mentioned. He then returns to the altar, genuflects, and
  continues the Mass in the usual way.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">18. A Mass celebrated
  by a priest with failing sight or otherwise infirm and having
  an indult to say a votive Mass, may have the following arrangement.</FONT></P>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">a. The priest
    says the prayers and the preface of the votive Mass.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">b. Another priest,
    a deacon, reader, or server is to do the readings from the Mass
    of the day or from a weekday Lectionary. If only a reader or
    server is present, he has permission also to read the gospel,
    but without the <I>Munda cor meum, Iube, domine, benedicere</I>
    and <I>Dominus sit in corde meo</I>. The celebrant however says
    the <I>Dominus vobiscum</I> before the reading of the gospel
    and at the end kisses the book.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">c. The choir,
    the congregation, or even the reader may take the Entrance, Offertory,
    and Communion antiphons, and the chants between the readings.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

  in the Divine Office</FONT></B></P>
			<P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">19. Pending the
  complete reform of the Divine Office, on days of class I and
  class II with a <I>Matins</I> of three Nocturnes, recitation
  of any one Nocturne with three Psalms and three readings is permitted.
  The hymn <I>Te Deum</I>, when called for by the rubrics, comes
  after the third reading. In the last three days of Holy Week
  the pertinent rubrics of the Roman Breviary are to be followed.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">20. Private recitation
  leaves out the absolution and blessing before the readings as
  well as the concluding <I>Tu autem</I>.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">21. In Lauds
  and Vespers celebrated with a congregation, in place of the <I>capitulum</I>
  there can be a longer reading from Scripture, taken, for example,
  from <I>Matins</I> or from the Mass of the day, or from a weekday
  Lectionary, and, as circumstances suggest, a brief homily. Unless
  Mass immediately follows, general intercessions may be inserted
  before the prayer.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">When there are
  such insertions, there need only be three Psalms, chosen in this
  way: at Lauds one of the first three, then the Canticle, then
  the final Psalm; at Vespers any three of the five Psalms.</FONT></P>
			<P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">22. At Compline
  celebrated with a congregation participating the Psalms can always
  be those of Sunday.</FONT></P>

  in the Rites for the Dead</FONT></B></P>
			<P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">23. The color
  for the office and Mass for the dead may in all cases be violet.
  But the conferences of bishops have the right to stipulate another
  color suited to the sensibilities of the people, not out of keeping
  with human grief, and expressive of Christian hope as enlightened
  by the paschal mystery.</FONT></P>
			<P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">24. At the absolution
  over the coffin and over the grave, other responsories taken
  from Matins for the dead, namely, <I>Credo quod Redemptor meus
  vivit, Qui Lazarum resucitasti, Memento mei, Deus, Libera me,
  Domine, de viis inferni,</I> may replace the <I>Libera me, Domine</I>.</FONT></P>

  may wear the chasuble for the <I>Asperges</I> before Mass on
  Sundays, for the blessing and imposition of ashes on Ash Wednesday,
  and for the absolution over a coffin or grave.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size="3" COLOR="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">27. A concelebrant
  must wear the vestments obligatory for individual celebration
  of Mass (Rite of Concelebration no. 12).</FONT></P>

  a serious reason, for example, a large number of concelebrants
