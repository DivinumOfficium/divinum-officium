Evangélium szent Márk Evangélista kõnyvébõl
!Mark 9:16-28
Azon idõben valaki így szól Jézushoz a tömegbõl: Mester, elhoztam hozzád a~
fiamat, akit néma lélek szállt meg. And so on.
_
Homily by the Venerable Bede, Priest (at Jarrow.)
!Bk. iii. ch. 38, on Mark ix.
Concerning this possessed person whom the Lord healed, after that He was come~
down from the mount, Mark saith that he was deaf and dumb, and Matthew (xvii.~
15) that he was lunatic. He was a figure of them of whom it is said A fool~
changeth as the moon, (Ecclus. xxvii. 12.) These are they who continue never in~
one stay, but change now to one sin, and now to another, waxing and waning dumb,~
in that they confess not the faith deaf, in that they have no ears for the~
word of truth. They foam at the mouth also, and pine away with folly. For it is~
the way with idiots, and swooners, and stupified, to foam their spittle out at~
their mouths. They gnash their teeth when they are inflamed with the heat of~
passion. They wither up in the paralysis of sloth and live nerveless lives~
unbraced by any strong exercise.

The father saith: And I spake to thy disciples, that they should cast him out,~
and they could not. Here he maketh a sort of accusation against the Apostles.~
But that cures cannot be wrought is sometimes owing, not to the powerlessness of~
them that would heal, but to the want of faith in them that are to be healed as~
saith the Lord According to your faith be it unto you. (Matth. ix. 29.) He~
answereth him, and saith O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you~
The meek and lowly One, Who, as a lamb before his shearers, is dumb, so opened~
not His Mouth, was not wearied out of patience, nor did He break out into words~
of passion, but He spake as a physician might speak, who saw that the sick man~
did contrary to his commands. Wherefore should I come unto thine house How~
long am I to throw away the exercise of my skill, while I order one thing and~
thou dost another

And He said unto them This kind can come forth by nothing but by prayer and~
fasting. While He teacheth the Apostles how the very worst kind of devil must be~
driven out, He giveth unto all of us an instruction unto life, that we may know~
that the most grievous trials, either from unclean spirits, or from men, are to~
be overcome by fasting and prayer. The wrath of the Lord also, when it is~
kindled to take vengeance of our sins, can be turned away by this remedy only.~
To fast, in a general sense, is not only to abstain from meats, but to restrain~
oneself from all the inticements of the flesh, and from all evil passions. So~
also, to pray, is not only to call in words for the mercy of God, but also, in~
all things which we do, in earnestness of faith to worship our Maker.

V. We are filled in the morning with thy mercy:
R. And we have rejoiced, and are delighted

[Ant 2]
This kind of devils * can come forth by nothing but by prayer and fasting.

[Oratio]
WE pray thee, O Lord, that the healing power of thy mercy may give strength to~
our weakness, that those things which do pass away by their own frailty, may be~
renewed again by thy clemency.
$Per Dominum

[Ant 3]
This kind of devils * can come forth by nothing but by prayer and fasting.
