Lesson from the first letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians
!1 Cor. 9:24-27; 10:1-5
Brethren: Do you not know that those who run in a race, all indeed run, but one receives the prize? So run as to obtain it. And everyone in a contest abstains from all things - and they indeed to receive a perishable crown, but we an imperishable. I, therefore, so run as not without a purpose; I so fight as not beating the air; but I chastise my body and bring it into subjection, lest perhaps after preaching to others I myself should be rejected. For I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, all were baptized in Moses, in the cloud and in the sea. And all ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink for they drank from the spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ. Yet with most of them God was not well pleased.

[Graduale]
!Ps 9:10-11; 9:19-20
A helper in due time in tribulation. Let them trust in thee who know thy name: for thou hast not forsaken them that seek thee, O Lord.
For the poor man shall not be forgotten to the end: the patience of the poor shall not perish for ever. Arise, O Lord, let not man be strengthened. 
!Ps 129:1-4
Out of the depths I cry to You, O Lord; Lord, hear my voice!
V. Let Your ears be attentive to the prayer of Your servant.
V. If You, O Lord, mark iniquities, Lord, who can stand it?
V. But with You is forgiveness, and by reason of Your law I have waited for You, O Lord.

!Ps 9:10-11; 9:19-20

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 20:1-16
At that time, Jesus spoke to His disciples this parable: The kingdom of heaven~
is like a householder who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his~
vineyard. And having agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them~
into his vineyard. And about the third hour, he went out and saw others~
standing in the market place idle; and he said to them, ‘Go you also into the~
vineyard, and I will give you whatever is just.’ So they went. And again he went~
out about the sixth, and about the ninth hour, and did as before. But about the~
eleventh hour he went out and found others standing about and he said to them,~
‘Why do you stand here all day idle?’ They said to him, ‘Because no man has~
hired us.’ He said to them, ‘Go you also into the vineyard.’ But when evening~
had come, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward, ‘Call the laborers, and~
pay them their wages, beginning from the last even to the first.’ Now when they~
of the eleventh hour came, they received each a denarius. And when the first in~
their term came, they thought that they would receive more; but they also~
received each his denarius. And on receiving it, they began to murmur against~
the householder, saying, ‘These last have worked a single hour, and you have put~
them on a level with us, who have borne the burden of the day’s heat.’ But~
answering one of them, he said, ‘Friend, I do you no injustice; did you not~
agree with me for a denarius? Take what is yours and go; I choose to give to~
this last even as to you. Have I not a right to do what I choose? Or are you~
envious because I am generous?’ Even so the last shall be first, and the first~
last; for many are called, but few are chosen.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 91:2
It is good to give thanks to the Lord, and to sing praise to Your name, Most~
High.

[Secreta]
Since You have accepted our gifts and our prayers, we beseech You, O Lord, to~
cleanse us by this heavenly sacrament and mercifully to hear us.
