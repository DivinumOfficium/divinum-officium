Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus
!Ecclus 24:23-31
I bud forth delights like the vine, my blossoms become fruit fair and rich. I am the mother of fair love, and of fear, and of knowledge, and of holy hope. In me is all grace of the way and of the truth, in me is all hope of life and of virtue. Come to me, all you that yearn for me, and be filled with my fruits; for my spirit is sweeter than honey, and my inheritance better to have than honey and the honeycomb. My memory is to everlasting generations. They who eat of me will hunger still, and they who drink of me will thirst for more. He who obeys me will not be put to shame, they who serve me will never fail. They who explain me shall have life everlasting.

[Graduale]
!  
Blessed and venerable are you, O Virgin Mary, who, without spot were made the~
Mother of the Savior.
V. O Virgin, Mother of God, He Whom the whole world cannot contain, shut Himself~
in your womb, becoming Man. Alleluia, alleluia.
V. After childbirth you remained a Virgin inviolate: O Mother of God, intercede~
for us. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 1:26-38
 At that time, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee called~
Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph, of the house of David,~
and the virgin’s name was Mary. And when the angel had come to her, he said,~
Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women. When she~
had heard him she was troubled at his word, and kept pondering what manner of~
greeting this might be. And the angel said to her, Do not be afraid, Mary, for~
you have found grace with God. Behold, you shall conceive in your womb and shall~
bring forth a Son; and you shall call His name Jesus. He shall be great, and~
shall be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give Him the~
throne of David His father, and He shall be king over the house of Jacob forever;~
and of His kingdom there shall be no end. But Mary said to the angel, How shall~
this happen, since I do not know man? And the angel answered and said to her,~
The Holy Spirit shall come upon you and the power of the Most High shall~
overshadow you; and therefore the Holy One to be born shall be called the Son of~
God. And behold, Elizabeth your kinswoman also has conceived a son in her old~
age, and she who was called barren is now in her sixth month; for nothing shall~
be impossible with God. But Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it~
done to me according to your word.

[Offertorium]
!Luke 1:28, 42.
Hail, Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women,~
