Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kõnyvébõl
!Matt 24:15-35
Amikor majd látjátok a szent helyen az iszonyatos pusztulást, amelyet Dániel~
próféta megjövendölt - aki olvassa, értse meg! És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Bk. iv. Comm. on Matth. xxiv.
This injunction to whoso readeth, to understand, showeth that there is here~
something mysterious. In Daniel we read as followeth " And in the midst of the~
week the sacrifice and the oblations shall be taken away and in the temple there~
shall be the abomination of desolation, even until the consummation of the time~
and a consummation shall be given to the desolation." (ix. 27.) It is of this~
same thing that the Apostle speaketh, when he saith that a man of iniquity, even~
an adversary, shall be exalted against whatsoever is called God, or is~
worshipped so that he shall even dare to stand in the temple of God, and to show~
himself as God whose coming shall, according to the working of Satan, destroy~
and banish away from God all who shall receive him.

[Lectio8]
This prophecy may be understood either (first) simply of Antichrist, (secondly)~
of the statue of Caesar, which Pilate set up in the Temple, or (thirdly) of the~
statue of Hadrian on horse-back, which hath stood, even until our own day, upon~
the site of the Holy of Holies. In the Scriptures of the Old Testament~
"abomination" is a word very often used for an idol, and the farther title "of~
desolation" is added to identify an idol erected upon the site of the desolate~
and ruined temple.

[Lectio9]
But we may also understand by the abomination of desolation, any bad doctrine~
and when we see such a thing get a standing in the Holy Place, that is, in the~
Church, and showing itself that it is God, that is, pretending that it is His~
revealed truth, then will be the time when it will be our duty to flee from~
Judea into the mountains, that is to say, to leave the letter, which passeth~
away, and all guise of Jewish superstition, and to hie us unto the everlasting~
hills, from whence God doth right wondrously cause His light to shine forth.~
~(Ps. lxxv. 5.) Then will it be our duty to find ourselves under a roof and in an~
house, wherethrough the fiery darts of the wicked one can never pierce to smite~
us, and not to come down to take anything out of the house of our old~
conversation, or to have regard unto those things which are behind but rather to~
sow in the field of the spiritual Scriptures, that we may reap thereof a~
bountiful harvest neither to have two coats, that thing forbidden to Apostles.~
~(Matth. x. 10.)

[Ant 2]
When ye shall see the abomination of desolation, * spoken of by Daniel the~
Prophet, stand in the Holy Place, (whoso readeth, let him understand)

[Versum 2]
V. The Lord reigneth He is clothed with majesty.
R. The Lord is clothed with strength, and hath girded Himself with power.

[Ant 3]
Ámen I say unto you, this generation shall not pass till all these things be~
fulfilled * heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away,~
saith the Lord.

[Versum 3]
V. Let my prayer, O Lord, be set forth.
R. As incense before thee.
