!1 Mac  9:28-32
28  And all the friends of Judas came together, and said to Jonathan:
29  Since thy brother Judas died, there is not a man like him to go forth against our enemies, Bacchides, and them that are the enemies of our nation.
30  Now therefore we have chosen thee this day to be our prince, and captain in his stead to fight our battles.
31  So Jonathan took upon him the government at that time, and rose up in the place of Judas his brother.
32  And Bacchides had knowledge of it, and sought to kill him.

33  And Jonathan and Simon his brother, knew it, and all that were with them: and they fled into the desert of Thecua, and they pitched by the water of the lake of Asphar,
34  And Bacchides understood it, and he came himself with all his army over the Jordan on the sabbath day.
35  And Jonathan sent his brother a captain of the people, to desire the Nabutheans his friends, that they would lend them their equipage, which was copious.
36  And the children of Jambri came forth out of Madaba, and took John, and all that he had, and went away with them.

37  After this it was told Jonathan, and Simon his brother, that the children of Jambri made a great marriage, and were bringing the bride out of Madaba, the daughter of one of the great princes of Chanaan, with great pomp.
38  And the remembered the blood of John their brother: and they went up, and hid themselves under the covert of the mountain.
39  And they lifted up their eyes, and saw: and behold a tumult, and great preparation: and the bridegroom came forth, and his friends, and his brethren to meet them with timbrels, and musical instruments, and many weapons.
40  And they rose up against them from the place where they lay in ambush, and slew them, and there fell many wounded, and the rest fled into the mountains, and they took all their spoils:
