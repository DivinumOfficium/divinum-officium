[Lectio1]
From the Book of Ecclesiastes
!Eccl 4:1-4
1 I turned myself to other things, and I saw the oppressions that are done under~
the sun, and the tears of the innocent, and they had no comforter; and they were~
not able to resist their violence, being destitute of help from any.
2 And I praised the dead rather than the living:
3 And I judged him happier than them both, that is not yet born, nor hath seen~
the evils that are done under the sun.
4 Again I considered all the labours of men, and I remarked that their~
industries are exposed to the envy of their neighhour: so in this also there is~
vanity, and fruitless care.

!Eccl 4:5-8
5 The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh, saying:
6 Better is a handful with rest, than both hands full with labour, and vexation~
of mind.
7 Considering I found also another vanity under the sun:
8 There is but one, and he hath not a second, no child, no brother, and yet he~
ceaseth not to labour, neither are his eyes satisfied with riches, neither doth~
he reflect, saying: For whom do I labour, and defraud my soul of good things? in~
this also is vanity, and a grievous vexation

!Eccl 4:9-13
9 It is better therefore that two should be together, than one: for they have~
the advantage of their society:
10 If one fall he shall be supported by the other: woe to him that is alone, for~
when he falleth, he hath none to lift him up.
11 And if two lie together, they shall warm one another: how shall one alone be~
warmed?
12 And if a man prevail against one, two shall withstand him: a threefold cord~
is not easily broken.
13 Better is a child that is poor and wise, than a king that is old and foolish,~
who knoweth not to foresee for hereafter.
