[Lectio1]
From the First Book of Kings
!1 Sam 2:12-14
12 Now the sons of Heli were children of Belial, not knowing the Lord,
13 Nor the office of the priests to the people: but whosoever had offered a~
sacrifice, the servant of the priest came, while the flesh was in boiling, with a~
fleshhook of three teeth in his hand,
14 And thrust it into the kettle, or into the caldron, or into the pot, or into~
the pan: and all that the fleshhook brought up, the priest took to himself. Thus~
did they to all Israel that came to Silo.

[Responsory1]
R. My sins are many, yea, they are more in number than the sands of the sea; I~
am not worthy to look up toward heaven because of the multitude of my iniquities;~
for I have provoked thee to anger
* And done evil in thy sight.
V. For I acknowledge my transgression, and my sin is ever before me, for against~
thee only have I sinned
R. And done evil in thy sight.

[Lectio2]
!1 Sam 2:15-17
15 Also before they burnt the fat, the servant of the priest came, and said to~
the man that sacrificed: Give me flesh to boil for the priest: for I will not~
take of thee sodden flesh, but raw.
16 And he that sacrificed said to him: Let the fat first be burnt today~
according to the custom, and then take as much as thy soul desireth. But he~
answered and said to him: Not so: but thou shalt give it me now, or else I will~
take it by force.
17 Wherefore the sin of the young men was exceeding great before the Lord:~
because they withdrew men from the sacrifice of the Lord.

[Responsory2]
R. O Lord, Thou hast hearkened unto the prayer of thy servant, that I might~
build a temple unto thy Name,
* O God of Israel, bless Thou, and hallow this house for ever
V. O Lord, Who keepest covenant with thy servants that walk before thee in all~
their heart.
R. O God of Israel, bless Thou, and hallow this house for ever

[Lectio3]
!1 Sam 2:18-21
18 But Samuel ministered before the face of the Lord: being a child girded with a~
linen ephod.
19 And his mother made him a little coat, which she brought to him on the~
appointed days, when she went up with her husband, to offer the solemn~
sacrifice.
20 And Heli blessed Elcana and his wife: and he said to him: The Lord give thee~
seed of this woman, for the loan thou hast lent to the Lord. And they went to~
their own home.
21 And the Lord visited Anna, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two~
daughters: and the child Samuel became great before the Lord.

[Responsory3]
R. Hearken, O Lord, unto the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth~
before thee today, that thine eyes may be open and thine ears attent
* Toward this house day and night.
V. Look down from thine high and holy place, O Lord, even from heaven thy~
dwelling
R. Toward this house, day and night.
&Gloria
R. Toward this house, day and night.
