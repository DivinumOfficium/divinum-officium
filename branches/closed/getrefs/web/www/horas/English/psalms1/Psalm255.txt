(Canticum Sapientiae * Sap 10:17-21)
10:17 And she rendered to the just the wages of their labours, and conducted them in a wonderful way: and she was to them for a covert by day, and for the light of stars by night:
10:18 And she brought them through the Red Sea, and carried them over through a great water.
10:19 But their enemies she drowned in the sea, and from the depth of hell she brought them out. Therefore the just took the spoils of the wicked.
10:20 And they sung to thy holy name, O Lord, and they praised with one accord thy victorious hand.
10:21 For wisdom opened the mouth of the dumb, and made the tongues of infants eloquent.
