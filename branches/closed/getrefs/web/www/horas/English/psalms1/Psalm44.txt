44:1 My heart hath uttered a good word; * I speak my works to the King.
44:2 My tongue is the pen of a scrivener * that writeth swiftly.
44:3 Thou art beautiful above the sons of men: grace is poured abroad in thy lips; * therefore hath God blessed thee for ever.
44:4 Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, * O thou most mighty.
44:5 With thy comeliness and thy beauty * set out, proceed prosperously, and reign.
44:6 Because of truth and meekness and justice: * and thy right hand shall conduct thee wonderfully.
44:7 Thy arrows are sharp: under thee shall people fall, * into the hearts of the king's enemies.
44:8 Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: * the sceptre of thy kingdom is a sceptre of uprightness.
44:9 Thou hast loved justice, and hated iniquity: * therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
44:10 Myrrh and stacte and cassia perfume thy garments, from the ivory houses: * out of which the daughters of kings have delighted thee in thy glory.
44:10 The queen stood on thy right hand, in gilded clothing; * surrounded with variety.
44:11 Hearken, O daughter, and see, and incline thy ear: * and forget thy people and thy father's house.
44:12 And the king shall greatly desire thy beauty; * for he is the Lord thy God, and him they shall adore.
44:13 And the daughters of Tyre with gifts, * yea, all the rich among the people, shall entreat thy countenance.
44:14 All the glory of the king's daughter is within, * in golden borders, clothed round about with varieties.
44:15 After her shall virgins be brought to the king: * her neighbours shall be brought to thee.
44:16 They shall be brought with gladness and rejoicing: * they shall be brought into the temple of the king.
44:17 Instead of thy fathers, sons are born to thee: * thou shalt make them princes over all the earth.
44:18 They shall remember thy name * throughout all generations.
44:18 Therefore shall people praise thee for ever; yea, * for ever and ever.
