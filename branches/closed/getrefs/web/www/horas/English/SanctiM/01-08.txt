[Lectio1]
!Rom 12:1-3
1 I Beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercy of God, that you present your~
bodies a living sacrifice, holy, pleasing unto God, your reasonable service.
2 And be not conformed to this world; but be reformed in the newness of your~
mind, that you may prove what is the good, and the acceptable, and the perfect~
will of God.
3 For I say, by the grace that is given me, to all that are among you, not to be~
more wise than it behoveth to be wise, but to be wise unto sobriety, and~
according as God hath divided to every one the measure of faith.

[Lectio2]
!Rom 12:4-8
4 For as in one body we have many members, but all the members have not the same~
office:
5 So we being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of~
another.
6 And having different gifts, according to the grace that is given us, either~
prophecy, to be used according to the rule of faith;
7 Or ministry, in ministering; or he that teacheth, in doctrine;
8 He that exhorteth, in exhorting; he that giveth, with simplicity; he that~
ruleth, with carefulness; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.

[Lectio3]
!Rom 12:9-16
9 Let love be without dissimulation. Hating that which is evil, cleaving to that~
which is good.
10 Loving one another with the charity of brotherhood, with honour preventing~
one another.
11 In carefulness not slothful. In spirit fervent. Serving the Lord.
12 Rejoicing in hope. Patient in tribulation. Instant in prayer.
13 Communicating to the necessities of the saints. Pursuing hospitality.
14 Bless them that persecute you: bless, and curse not.
15 Rejoice with them that rejoice; weep with them that weep.
16 Being of one mind one towards another. Not minding high things, but~
consenting to the humble. Be not wise in your own conceits.
