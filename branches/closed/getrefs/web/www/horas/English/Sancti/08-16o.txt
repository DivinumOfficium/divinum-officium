De Canticis Canticorum
!Song 2:1-7
1 I am the flower of the field, and the lily of the valleys. [2] As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.
3 As the apple tree among the trees of the woods, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow, whom I desired: and his fruit was sweet to my palate.
4 He brought me into the cellar of wine, he set in order charity in me.
5 Stay me up with flowers, compass me about with apples: because I languish with love.
6 His left hand is under my head, and his right hand shall embrace me.
7 I adjure you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and the harts of the, fields, that you stir not up, nor make the beloved to awake, till she please.

[Lectio2]
!Song 2:8-13
8 The voice of my beloved, behold he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping~
over the hills.
9 My beloved is like a roe, or a young hart. Behold he standeth behind our wall,~
looking through the windows, looking through the lattices.
10 Behold my beloved speaketh to me: Arise, make haste, my love, my dove, my~
beautiful one, and come.
11 For winter is now past, the rain is over and gone.
12 The flowers have appeared in our land, the time of pruning is come: the voice~
of the turtle is heard in our land:
13 The fig tree hath put forth her green figs: the vines in flower yield their~
sweet smell.

[Lectio3]
!Song 2:13-17
13 Arise, my love, my beautiful one, and come:
14 My dove in the clefts of the rock, in the hollow places of the wall, shew me~
thy face, let thy voice sound in my ears: for thy voice is sweet, and thy face~
comely. 15 Catch us the little foxes that destroy the vines: for our vineyard~
hath flourished.
16 My beloved to me, and I to him who feedeth among the lilies,
17 Till the day break, and the shadows retire. Return: be like, my beloved, to a~
roe, or to a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.
