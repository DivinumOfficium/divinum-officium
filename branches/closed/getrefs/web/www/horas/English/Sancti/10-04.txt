[Oratio]
O God, Who didst use the worthy deeds of thy blessed servant Francis as a mean~
whereby to make thy Church again the mother of children, grant that we like him~
may set little price by earthly things, and attain unto a portion of those good~
things which Thou givest in heaven.

Francis was born at Assisi in Umbria, (in the year of our Lord 11 82.) From his~
early youth he followed the example of his father, (Peter Bernardone,) and~
busied himself with merchandise. It befell one day that, contrary to his usage,~
he had thrust from him a beggar, who cried for money for Christ's sake, when,~
being cut to the heart with regret, he gave him large alms, and promised to God~
from that day forth never to deny to any that asked of him. He fell after this~
into a grievous sickness, and from the time that he was healed thereof, he gave~
himself more earnestly to works of love for his neighbour. At length he became~
fain in this sort to be perfect, even as the Lord hath said in the Gospel,~
~(Matth. xix. 21,) and gave to the poor whatsoever he had. His father would not~
have it so, and brought him before the Bishop of Assisi, that he might renounce~
all right to any inheritance. He cheerfully gave up all to his father, even to~
his clothes, telling them that now he should be able with more utter dependence~
to say Our Father, Who art in heaven

Uppon the 24th day of February, in the year 1209,) he heard read the words of~
the Gospel Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses, nor scrip~
for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes. (Matth. x. 9, 10.) Thereupon~
he determined that that should be his rule of living. He took off his shoes, and~
contented himself with one coat. When he had gathered twelve comrades, he~
founded the Order of Friars Minor. He went to Rome in the (same) year, to get~
from the Apostolic See a confirmation of his Order. When he came Pope Innocent~
III. thrust him away. Thereafter he dreamt that he saw the Church of the most~
Holy Saviour falling, and whom he had cast forth bearing it up with his~
shoulders. He bade therefore that he should be sought for and brought again~
before him, welcomed him kindly, and approved all the Rule which he had~
established. Francis therefore sent his Friars into all quarters of the world to~
preach the Gospel of Christ. He himself was fain to find some occasion of~
martyrdom, and therefore made a voyage into Syria, (in the year 1219,) but the~
Sultan treated him with the greatest kindness, offering him many gifts, and,~
since he could do no good, he returned again to Italy.

Towards the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, (in the year~
1224), when there had already been built many houses of Friars of his Order, he~
withdrew himself into a most secret place upon Mount Alverno, and began to fast~
for forty days in honour of the holy Archangel Michael. Upon the Feast-day of~
the Uplifting of the Holy Cross, (as he was praying upon the side of the~
mountain,) he saw a vision of a crucified Seraph, which left in his hands and~
feet holes with nails therein, and in his side a great wound. Holy BuonaVentura~
hath left it in writing that he once heard Pope Alexander IV., when preaching,~
testify that he had himself seen these marks. It was a sign of such love of~
Christ toward him as stirred up the great wonder of all men. Two years~
thereafter he fell sick unto death, and was fain to be carried into the Church~
of St Mary-of-the-Angels, that he might give up the breath of life in the same~
place where God had breathed into him the breath of the life of grace. Being~
there (laid on the earth, sprinkled with ashes, and covered with an old habit,)~
he exhorted the Friars to be poor and lowly, and to cleave to the faith of the~
Holy Church of Rome. (He then caused the Gospel of St John to be read from the~
words Now before the feast of the Passover to the end,) after which he began to~
recite the 141st Psalm: I cried unto the Lord with my voice, and in uttering the~
words, the righteous wait for me, till Thou deal bountifully with me, he gave up~
the ghost. It was the 4th day of October, (in the year 1226.) He was famous for~
miracles, and Pope Gregory IX. added his name to the list of the Saints.

Francis was born at Assissi in Umbria and, following hia fathers example, as a~
young man became a merchant. After recovering from a very serious illness he~
began most eagerly to undertake works of charity and, since his father~
indignantly objected, he gave up to him everything he had, adding that~
henceforth he had a better right to say, "Our Father who art in heaven." Having~
heard the Gospel. words concerning the poverty of Apostles, he took off his~
sandals and kept only one cloak and, when he had gained twelve disciples,~
founded the Order of Friars Minor. This was confirmed by Pope Innocent III, who~
had been divinely forewarned, and it spread in a wonderful way. Later Francis~
went to the solitude of Mount Alvernia where, on the day of the Exaltation of~
the Holy Cross, he received the stigmata from a Seraph carrying between his~
wings the image of the Crucified; the traces of the nails and the lance then~
appeared in his hands, feet and side. Two years afterwards he fell very ill and.~
in the Church of St. Mary of the Angels where he had received the spirit of~
grace from God, he exhorted the brothers to poverty, patience and the~
preservation of the faith of the holy Roman Church and, on October 4, most~
lovingly breathed forth his soul.
