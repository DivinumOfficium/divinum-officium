111:2 His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the righteous shall be blessed.
111:3 Glory and wealth shall be in his house: and his justice remaineth for ever and ever.
111:4 To the righteous a light is risen up in darkness: he is merciful, and compassionate and just.
111:5 Acceptable is the man that sheweth mercy and lendeth: he shall order his words with judgment:
111:6 Because he shall not be moved for ever.
111:7 The just shall be in everlasting remembrance: he shall not fear the evil hearing. His heart is ready to hope in the Lord:
111:8 His heart is strengthened, he shall not be moved until he look over his enemies.
111:9 He hath distributed, he hath given to the poor: his justice remaineth for ever and ever: his horn shall be exalted in glory.
111:10 The wicked shall see, and shall be angry, he shall gnash with his teeth and pine away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.
