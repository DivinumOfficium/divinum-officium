15:1 (The inscription of a title to David himself.) Preserve me, O Lord, for I have put my trust in thee.
15:2 I have said to the Lord, thou art my God, for thou hast no need of my goods.
15:3 To the saints, who are in his land, he hath made wonderful all my desires in them.
15:4 Their infirmities were multiplied: afterwards they made haste. I will not gather together their meetings for bloodofferings: nor will I be mindful of their names by my lips.
15:5 The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup: it is thou that wilt restore my inheritance to me.
15:6 The lines are fallen unto me in goodly places: for my inheritance is goodly to me.
15:7 I will bless the Lord, who hath given me understanding: moreover, my reins also have corrected me even till night.
15:8 I set the Lord always in my sight: for he is at my right hand, that I be not moved.
15:9 Therefore my heart hath been glad, and my tongue hath rejoiced: moreover, my flesh also shall rest in hope.
15:10 Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; nor wilt thou give thy holy one to see corruption.
15:11 Thou hast made known to me the ways of life, thou shalt fill me with joy with thy countenance: at thy right hand are delights even to the end.
