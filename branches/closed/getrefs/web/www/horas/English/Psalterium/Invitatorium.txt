v. Come let us praise the Lord with joy:~
let us joyfully sing to God our saviour.~
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving;~
and make a joyful noise to him with psalms. 
$ant
v. For the Lord is a great God,~
and a great King above all gods.~
For in his hand are all the ends of the earth:~
and the heights of the mountains are his.

v. For the sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land. (*genuflect*) Come let us adore and fall down: and weep before the Lord that made us:  For he is the Lord our God: and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand.  
$ant
v. Today if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts:~
As in the provocation, according to the day of temptation~
in the wilderness: where your fathers tempted me,~
they proved me, and saw my works. 
$ant2
v. Forty years long was I offended with that generation,~
and I said: These always err in heart.~
And these men have not known my ways: so I swore~
in my wrath that they shall not enter into my rest.
