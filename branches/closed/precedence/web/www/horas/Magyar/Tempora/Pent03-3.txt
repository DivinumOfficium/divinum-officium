A királyok elsõ könyvébõl
!1 Sam 13:1-4
1 Saul.. éves volt, amikor Izrael királya lett, és.. évig uralkodott Izrael fölött. 
2 Saul kiválasztott magának háromezer embert Izraelbõl. Kétezren Saullal voltak Michmászban és Bétel hegyvidékén, ezren meg Jonatánnal Gebában, Benjamin (földjén). A nép többi részét hazaküldte, mindenkit a maga sátorába. 
3 Történt, hogy Jonatán leütötte a filiszteusok helytartóját, aki Gibeában székelt, s a filiszteusok hírét vették, hogy a héberek fellázadtak. Saul mindenütt megfúvatta a harsonákat az országban, 
4 így egész Izrael megtudta az újságot: "Saul leütötte a filiszteusok helytartóját, s Izrael magára vonta a filiszteusok haragját." A nép Gilgalban Saul köré gyûlt. 

[Lectio2]
!1 Sam 13:5-8
5 De a filiszteusok is egybegyûltek, hogy harcba szálljanak Izraellel: háromezer harci szekér, hatezer ló és annyi gyalogos, mint a tenger partján a föveny. Kivonultak, és Michmász közelében ütöttek tábort, Bet-Aventõl keletre. 
6 Amikor Izrael fiai látták, hogy szorult helyzetbe kerültek, s a népet nagyon szorongatják, a nép barlangokba, üregekbe, sziklahasadékokba s a föld alá, ciszternákba rejtõzött. 
7 Sõt a Jordán gázlóin át Gád és Gileád földjére menekültek. Saul még mindig Gilgalban volt, s az egész nép aggódott érte. 
8 Hét napig várt, addig az idõpontig, amelyet Sámuel meghatározott. De Sámuel nem érkezett meg Gilgalba, s népe magára hagyta Sault, szétszéledt. 

[Lectio3]
!1 Sam 13:9-14
9 Erre azt mondta: "Hozzatok ide égõáldozatot és közösségi áldozatot. 
10 Amikor épp készen lett az égõáldozat bemutatásával, lám, Sámuel megérkezett. Saul eléje ment, hogy üdvözölje. 
11 Sámuel azonban így szólt: "Mit tettél?" "Mivel láttam - felelte Saul -, hogy a nép cserbenhagyott és szétszéledt, te a megbeszélt idõre nem érkeztél meg, a filiszteusok azonban összegyûltek Michmászban, 
12 gondoltam: a filiszteusok kivonulnak ellenem Gilgalba, mielõtt még az Urat kiengesztelném. Azért bátorságot vettem, s bemutattam az égõáldozatot. 
13 Erre Sámuel ezt mondta Saulnak: "Ostobaságot csináltál! Ha teljesítetted volna az Úrnak, Istenednek parancsát, amelyet adott neked, az Úr is fenntartotta volna uralmadat Izrael fölött örök idõkre. 
14 De így még a te uralmadat sem tartja fenn. Az Úr keresett egy szíve szerinti embert, s ezt rendelte az Úr népe fölé fejedelemnek, mivel nem tartottad meg, amit az Úr parancsolt neked."

!From the Encyclical Letter of Pope Pius XI
But in what sense can it be said that our expiatory practices can give~
consolation to Christ, since he is now reigning in heavenly joy? We answer in~
the words of Saint Augustine (from a passage entirely appropriate to this~
subject) : Give me a lover, and he will feel the truth of what I say. Every~
soul which is on fire with the love of God, if it but turns its thoughts to the~
past, doth in its meditation perceive and contemplate Christ suffering for~
mankind ; afflicted by grief in the midst of sorrows endured for us men and for~
our salvation ; almost overcome by afflictions, vexations, and reproaches ; yea,~
bruised by our sins ; with whose stripes we are healed. And devout souls will~
have an appreciation in proportion to their understanding of these mysteries, if~
they perceive that the sins and crimes of men (no matter when committed) were~
the real reason why the Son of God was condemned to death, and that sins~
committed in this present are able in some wise to cause the death of Christ,~
renewing as they do, the cause of that selfsame death, with its sufferings and~
agonies, which was accomplished on the Cross ; for every sin must be said to~
renew, in some fashion, the Lord's passion, concerning which we read in the~
Scriptures : They crucify themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an~
open shame.

[Lectio5]
And since in the agony in the Garden the soul of Christ became sorrowful even~
unto death, in view of our own future sins which were foreseen by him, there can~
be no doubt that at the same time he was in some way consoled, through the~
provision of our acts of reparation, when the Angel from heaven appeared unto~
him to comfort him in the sorrows of his Heart, which was so bowed down with~
weariness and grief. And so, even at this present time, we can and we ought to~
console, in a mystical but nonetheless real manner, that most Sacred Heart :~
which same is being wounded continually by the sins of thankless men. It is in~
this sense, namely, that Christ is grieved over his abandonment by his friends~
that we are accustomed to interpret the holy liturgy whenever we say in the~
words of the Psalmist : Thy rebuke hath broken my Heart ; I am full of heaviness ; I~
looked for some to have pity on me, but there was no man, neither found I any to~
comfort me.

[Lectio6]
To the foregoing we should add that the expiatory passion of Christ is renewed,~
and in a certain manner continued, in his mystical body, which same is the~
Church. In this connection, once more the words of Saint Augustine are~
appropriate : Christ suffered all that he needed to suffer ; nothing at all is~
lacking in the number of his sufferings ; therefore his sufferings are completed~
in him as the Head ; but there remaineth even yet the sufferings of Christ to be~
endured in the body. Which truth verily the Lord Jesus himself made known, at~
the time that Saul was breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the~
disciples, to whom the Lord said : I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. By these~
words he plainly affirmed that persecutions visited on the Church are in reality~
directed against the Head of the Church. Meet it is therefore that Christ, thus~
still suffering in his mystical body, should desire to have us sharers in his~
own work of expiation, even as our own need moveth us to desire and seek union~
with him. And since we are the body of Christ, and members of his very flesh~
and bones, whatever the Head must suffer all the members of the body must needs~
suffer together with him.

From the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 19:31-37

At that time : The Jews, because it was the Preparation, that the bodies should~
not remain upon the cross on the Sabbath Day, for that Sabbath Day was an high~
day, besought Pilate that their legs might broken, and that they might be taken~
away. And so on.

A Homily by St. Peter Canisius the Priest
!Exhortationes domesticæ. Medit. 6-7
Have thou all diligence to turn over in thy mind this matter, namely, That he,~
who is God over all, endured with unutterable charity, a most bitter death on~
the Cross, in the exceeding anguish of his Heart, whilst the whole world mocked~
him! And this he did for thee, who art but a paltry little worm! Meditate on~
the boundless generosity which Christ the Preserver manifested to all his own~
people. For at one time, standing in the midst of the people, he cried out : If~
any man thirst, let him come to me and drink ; thereby shewing how ready he was~
to welcome everyone, and help him in his every need. Consider how freely he~
giveth thee to drink of his Heart's precious blood, considering that his sacred~
side was set open, wherefrom he poured forth whatever blood was still left in~
his body.

[Lectio8]
!In Evang. Dominica I post Pascha
And so that I may not be utterly ungrateful, often I call up before mine eyes~
those perennial fountains of gifts and of all good things, since from them that~
most sweet promise standeth out : Ye shall draw waters with joy out of the~
founts of the Saviour, and ye shall say in that day : Praise ye the Lord. There~
will I flee, to those thrice-blest holes in the rock which can never be~
demolished ; there will I build for myself a most durable nest, holding nothing~
better, in all sorrows and perils that befall me, than to think on the wounds of~
the Lord.

[Lectio9]
!Medit. 6
Therefore in every trial do thou flee quickly to the lovable Heart of Christ,~
and call to mind his goodness and charity, setting them in contrast to thine own~
vileness, malice, unfaithfulness, and pride. For consider how great was the~
charity of Christ in inviting all men unto himself : Come unto me, all ye that~
travail and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you. It is with this intent~
that he offereth himself to us, ready and desirous, out of love for us, to carry~
the burdens of each and all! Cast then thy sins into the abyss of his charity,~
and straightway thou shalt find thyself lightened of thy load.
