O Lord, we beseech thee, that there may plead for us thine holy Evangelist Luke,~
who, for thy Name's sake, bore about always in his body the death of the Cross.
$Per Dominum

[Lectio4]
! Fom the Book on Ecclesiastical Writers, written by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.) 
Luke was a physician of Antioch, who, as~
appeareth from his writings, knew the Greek language. He was a follower of the~
Apostle Paul, and his fellow traveller in all his wanderings. He wrote a Gospel,~
whereof the same Paul saith We have sent with him the brother, whose praise is~
in the Gospel throughout all the Churches (2 Cor. viii. 18.) Of him, he writeth~
unto the Colossians, (iv. 14): Luke, the beloved physician, greeteth you. And~
again, unto Timothy, (II. iv. 11): Only Luke is with me. He also published~
another excellent book intituled The Acts of the Apostles, wherein the history~
is brought down to Paul's two - years sojourn at Rome, that is to say, until the~
fourth year of Nero, from which we gather that it was at Rome that the said book~
was composed.

[Lectio5]
The silence of Luke is one of the reasons why we reckon among Apocryphal books~
The Acts of Paul and Thekla, and the whole story about the baptism of Leo. For~
why should the fellow - traveller of the Apostle, who knew other things, be~
ignorant only of this? At the same time there is against these documents the~
statement of Tertullian, almost a contemporary writer, that the Apostle John~
convicted a certain Priest in Asia, who was a great admirer of the Apostle Paul,~
of having written them, and that the said Priest owned that he had been induced~
to compose them through his admiration for Paul, and that he was deposed in~
consequence. There are some persons who suspect that when Paul in his Epistles~
useth the phrase, According to my Gospel (Rom. ii. 16, Tim. ii. 8,) he meaneth~
the Gospel written by Luke.

[Lectio6]
However, Luke learned his Gospel not from the Apostle Paul only, who had not~
companied with the Lord in the flesh, but also from other Apostles, as himself~
declareth at the beginning of his work, where he saith They delivered them~
unto us, which from the beginning were eye - witnesses and ministers of the word,~
(i. 2.) According to what he had heard, therefore, did he write his Gospel. As~
to the Acts of the Apostles, he composed them from his own personal knowledge.~
He was never married. He lived eightyfour years. He is buried at Constantinople,~
whither his bones were brought from Achaia in the twentieth year of Constantine,~
together with the reliques of the Apostle Andrew.
