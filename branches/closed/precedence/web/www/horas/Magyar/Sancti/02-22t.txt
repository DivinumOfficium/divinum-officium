[Ant Vespera]
Behold an high priest, * who in his days pleased God, and was found righteous the kingdom of God;;109
None was found like unto him, * to keep the Law of the Most High;;110
Therefore the Lord assured him * by an oath that He would multiply his seed among His people;;111
O all ye Priests of God, * bless ye the Lord O all ye servants of the Lord, sing praises unto our God;;112
Good and faithful servant, * enter thou into the joy of thy Lord

[Hymnus Vespera]
Peter, whatever thou shalt bind on earth,
The same is bound above the starry sky;
What here thy delegated power doth loose,
Is loosed in heaven's suprenleit Court on high:
To judgment shalt thou come, when the world's end is nigh.
_
Praise to the Father, through all ages be;
Praise to the consubstantial sovereign Son,
And Holy Ghost, One glorious Trinity;
To whom all majesty and might belong;
So sing we now, and such be our eternal song.
Ámen.

[Versum 1]
V. The Lord loved him and beautified him.
R. He clothed him with a robe of glory.

of heaven, and the power to bind and to loose, loose us, we beseech thee, at his~
mighty intercession, from all the bands of our sins.

Olvasmány szent Péter apostol elsõ levelébõl
!1 Pet 1:1-5
1 Péter, Jézus Krisztus apostola a zarándokoknak, akik Pontusz, Galácia,~
Kappadócia, Ázsia és Bitinia területén szórványokban élnek, s akiket az
2 Atyaisten elõretudása birtokában kiválasztott, a Lélek megszentelõ erejébõl az~
engedelmességre és a Jézus Krisztus vérével való meghintésre. Kegyelemben és~
békében bõven legyen részetek!
3 Legyen áldott az Isten és Urunk, Jézus Krisztus Atyja, aki minket nagy~
irgalmában Jézusnak a halálból való feltámadása által új életre hívott, az élõ~
reményre,
4 hogy a mennyekben elpusztíthatatlan, tiszta és soha el nem hervadó örökség~
várjon rátok.
5 Az Isten hatalma megõrzött titeket a hitben az örök üdvösségre, amely készen~
áll, hogy az utolsó idõben majd megnyilvánuljon.

[Responsory1]
R. Simon Peter, before I called thee out of the ship, I knew thee, and appointed~
thee for a ruler over My people.
* And I have given unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.
V. Whatsoever, thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and~
whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.
R. And I have given unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.

[Lectio2]
!1 Pet 1:6-9
6 Abban örülni fogtok, noha most egy kicsit szomorkodnotok kell, mert különféle~
kísértések érnek benneteket,
7 hogy a próbát kiállva hitetek, amely értékesebb a tûz próbálta veszendõ~
aranynál, Jézus Krisztus megjelenésekor méltó legyen a dicséretre, a dicsõségre~
és a tiszteletre.
8 Akit noha nem láttatok, mégis szerettek; bár most sem látjátok, mégis hisztek~
benne. De mivel hisztek, ujjonghattok a megdicsõültek kimondhatatlan örömével,
9 mert eléritek hitetek célját: lelketek üdvösségét.

[Responsory2]
R. Simon Peter, if thou lovest Me, feed My sheep. Lord, Thou knowest that I love~
thee
* I will lay down my life for thy sake.
V. If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee.
R. I will lay down my life for thy sake.

!1 Pet 1:10-12
10 Ezt az üdvösséget keresték és kutatták a próféták, akik a nektek szánt~
kegyelemrõl jövendöltek.
11 Töprengtek rajta, vajon milyen idõpontra vagy milyen korra mutat Krisztusnak~
bennük mûködõ Lelke, elõre megmondva a Krisztusra váró szenvedéseket és az~
azutáni dicsõséget.
12 Kinyilatkoztatást kaptak, hogy ne maguknak, hanem nektek legyenek~
szolgálatotokra azzal, amit az evangélium hirdetõi most közöltek veletek az~
égbõl küldött Szentlélek erejébõl. Ezekbe (az igazságokba) maguk az angyalok is~
csak vágynak bepillantani.

[Responsory3]
R. Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My Church, and the gates of~
hell shall not prevail against it.
* And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.

thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.

From the Sermons of St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!16th on the Saints.
The solemn Feast of to-day received from our forefathers the name of that of St~
Peter's Chair at Antioch, because there is a tradition that it was on this day~
that Peter, first of the Apostles, was enthroned in a Bishop's Chair. Rightly,~
therefore, do the Churches observe the first day of that Chair, the right to~
which the Apostle received for the salvation of the Churches from the Lord of~
the Churches Himself, with the words Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will~
build My Church.It was the Lord Himself Who called Peter the foundation of the~
Church, and therefore it is right that the Church should reverence this~
foundation whereon her mighty structure riseth. Justly is it written in the~
Psalm which we have just heard Let them exalt him in the congregation of the~
people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders. Blessed be God, Who hath~
commanded that the Blessed Apostle Peter should be exalted in the congregation!~
Worthy to be honoured by the Church is that foundation from which her goodly~
towers rise, ascending to heaven!

[Responsory4]
R. Thou art the Shepherd of the sheep, and the Prince of the Apostles, and unto~
thee hath God given all the kingdoms of the world.
* Therefore unto thee hath He given the keys of the kingdom of heaven.
V. Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever~
thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
R. Therefore unto thee hath He given the keys of the kingdom of heaven.

[Lectio5]
In the honour which is this day paid to the inauguration of the first Bishop's~
throne, an honour is paid to the office of all Bishops. The Churches testify one~
to another, that, the greater the Church's dignity, the greater the reverence~
due to her priests. While I confess how rightly godly custom hath exalted this~
Feast in the estimation of all the Churches, the more do I wonder at the growth~
of that unhealthy error which at this day causeth some unbelievers to lay food~
and wine upon the graves of the dead, as if souls once rid of the body had any~
longer any need of bodily refreshment. quia tanto necesse plus habet ecclesia~
dignitas, quanto sacerdotalis officium plus honoris. Cum sollemnitatem hanc~
ecclesiis merito religiosa observatio introduxerit, miror cur apud quosdam~
infideles hodie tam perniciosus error incruerit, ut super tumulos defunctorum~
cibos et uina conferant, quasi egressæ de corporibus animæ carnales cibos~
reqirant. Epulas enim et refectiones caro tantum requirit, spiritus autem et~
anima his non indigent. Parare aliquis suis caris dicit, quod ipse devorat; quod~
præstat uentri, imptat pietati.

[Responsory5]
R. Peter, I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not
* And when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.
V. Flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but My Father Which is in~
heaven.
R. And when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.

[Lectio6]
Cessate ergo fratres ab hoc gentili fidelitatis errore. Animæ enim sanctæ, quæ~
in hoc sæculo aut per uitæ innocentiam puræ sunt, aut pænitentiæ satisfactione~
purgantur, a saluatore nostro recipiuntur, et cum eo esse credendæ sunt,~
secundum Apostoli dictum: Cupio dissolui, et esse cum Christo. Animæ ergo~
fratrum, parentumque nostrorum, minime cibis carnalibus delectantur. Offendi his~
magis possunt, quam delectari, si, cum illi sacris sedibus sint, uos eas in~
terra esse credatis. Cessate ergo ab his erroribus, et, sicut scriptum est, Quæ~
sursum sunt sapite, non quæ super terram : ut superstitiones fidei uestræ~
contrarias repudiantes, dum ea, quae deo placita sunt, faciatis, etiam vos cum~
Christo in æternum essse mereamini quod ipse præstare dignetur.

[Responsory6]
R. Peter, lovest thou Me? Lord, Thou knowest that I love thee.
* Feed My sheep.
V. Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou Me more than these? Lord, Thou knowest that I~
love thee.
R. Feed My sheep.

R. Feed My sheep.

Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kõnyvébõl
!Matt 16:13-19
Abban az idõben Jézus Fülöp Cezáreájának vidékére ért, megkérdezte~
tanítványaitól: "Kinek tartják az emberek az Emberfiát?" És így tovább.
_
Homily by Pope St Leo (the Great.)
!3rd on the Anniversary of his own election.
The Lord asked His disciples Who men said that He was, and their answers were~
human as long as they were the answers of human reason, unilluminated by Divine~
light. At last, when the glimmerings of earthly conjecture were spoken, he whose~
Apostleship is the first in dignity, was the first to confess his Lord. And~
Simon Peter answered and said: Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.~
And Jesus answered and said unto him Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona, for flesh~
and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but My Father Which is in heaven. That~
is to say, For this cause art thou blessed, because My Father Himself hath~
taught thee; the opinions of men have not beguiled thee, the voices of angels~
have not taught thee, not flesh and blood, but He, Whose Only begotten Son I am,~
hath revealed Me unto thee.

[Responsory7]
R. Jesus asked His disciples, saying Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?~
Peter answered, and said Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.
* And I say unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My~
Church.
V. Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it~
unto thee, but My Father Which is in heaven.
R. And I say unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My~
Church.

[Lectio8]
Thus saith the Lord unto Simon Peter: And I say also unto thee, That thou art~
Peter. That is to say, Even as My Father hath revealed unto thee concerning Me~
that I am God, even so now will I also reveal unto thee that thou art Peter; I~
am the sure Rock of defence, the Corner Stone, Who make both one, (Eph. ii. 20,~
15,) I am the Foundation, beside Which other can no man lay, (1 Cor. iii. 11,)~
and thou also art a rock, in My Strength made hard, and those things whereof I~
by right am Lord, into thy hand do I give them, that thou mayst bear rule over~
them, for Me, and with Me. And upon this rock I will build My Church, and the~
gates of hell shall not prevail against it. Upon this strength of thine, whereof I~
am the Strength, I will build My eternal temple, and upon the truth of thy~
confession of Me I will make to rise that My glorious Church whose spires shall~
pierce to heaven.

[Responsory8]
R. The Lord hath chosen thee for a priest unto Himself, to offer up unto Him
* The sacrifice of praise.
V. Offer unto God thanksgiving, and pay thy vows unto the Most High.
R. The sacrifice of praise.
&Gloria
R. The sacrifice of praise.

[Lectio9]
Against this confession the gates of hell shall never prevail, neither shall the~
bands of death take hold upon it. Thus saith He That is faithful and true. And~
as this confession hath power to lift up to heaven them that make it, so is it~
able to thrust down to hell them that gainsay it. Wherefore it is said unto the~
most blessed Peter And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven~
and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and~
whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven. This power~
passed indeed to the other Apostles also; this the Lord's will had effect in~
them; but it is not in vain that it is written that that was given to one which~
passed from him to all. To Peter alone were the keys given, and Peter is set as~
the pattern for all them that bear rule in the Church to follow. There remaineth~
therefore the right of Peter, wheresoever his judgment decreeth justice. Neither~
is there anything too hard, or too lax, where there is nothing bound and nothing~
loosed, save when Peter bindeth or looseth.
&teDeum

[Hymnus Laudes]
Peter, blest Shepherd, hearken to our cry,
And with a word unloose our guilty chain;
Thou! who hast power to open the gates on high
To men below, and power to shut them fast again!
_
Praise, blessing, majesty, through endless days,
Be to the Trinity immortal given;
Who in pure unity profoundly sways
Eternally alike all things in earth and heaven.
Ámen.
