Lesson from the book of Isaias
!Isa 2:1-3
1 The word that Isaias the son of Amos saw, concerning Juda and Jerusalem.
2 And in the last days the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be prepared~
on the top of mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills, and all~
nations shall flow unto it.
3 And many people shall go, and say: Come and let us go up to the mountain of~
the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us his ways,~
and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall come forth from Sion, and the~
word of the Lord from Jerusalem.

[Responsory1]
R. O ye mountains of Israel, shoot forth your branches and blossom and bring~
forth fruit.
* The day of the Lord is at hand to come.
V. Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down the Righteous~
One let the earth open, and let her bring forth the Saviour.
R. The day of the Lord is at hand to come.

[Lectio2]
!Isa 2:4-6
4 And he shall judge the Gentiles, and rebuke many people: and they shall turn~
their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into sickles: nation shall not~
lift up sword against nation, neither shall they be exercised any more to war.
5 O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord.
6 For thou hast cast off thy people, the house of Jacob: because they are filled~
as in times past, and have had soothsayers as the Philistines, and have adhered~
to strange children.

[Responsory2]
R. Let the mountains break forth into singing, and the hills bring forth~
righteousness 
* For the Lord, the Light of the world, cometh with power.
V. Out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
R. For the Lord, the Light of the world, cometh with power.

them not.
