03-26# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 46: Concerning Those Who Do Amiss In Any Other Matters
_
If anyone at any work, in the kitchen, in the cellar, in serving the brethren, in the bakery, in the garden, in working at any occupation or in any place, shall have done anything amiss, or broken or lost anything or transgressed at all and shall not have forthwith come before the abbot and the community to declare his fault and make full satisfaction, when it becomes known through some other member of the community let him be subjected to severe correction. But in a case of the fault upon the conscience being unknown to others, let him lay it open to his spiritual seniors or to the abbot only, since they know how to attend to their own wounds and how to avoid disclosing and making known those of others.
