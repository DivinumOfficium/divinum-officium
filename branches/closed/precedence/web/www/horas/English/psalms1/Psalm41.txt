41:1 As the hart panteth after the fountains of water; * so my soul panteth after thee, O God.
41:2 My soul hath thirsted after the strong living God; * when shall I come and appear before the face of God?
41:3 My tears have been my bread day and night, * whilst it is said to me daily: Where is thy God?
41:4 These things I remembered, and poured out my soul in me: * for I shall go over into the place of the wonderful tabernacle, even to the house of God:
41:5 With the voice of joy and praise; * the noise of one feasting.
41:6 Why art thou sad, O my soul? * and why dost thou trouble me?
41:6 Hope in God, for I will still give praise to him: * the salvation of my countenance, and my God.
41:7 My soul is troubled within myself: * therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan and Hermoniim, from the little hill.
41:8 Deep calleth on deep, * at the noise of thy flood-gates.
41:9 All thy heights and thy billows * have passed over me.
41:10 In the daytime the Lord hath commanded his mercy; * and a canticle to him in the night.
41:11 With me is prayer to the God of my life. * I will say to God: Thou art my support.
41:12 Why hast thou forgotten me? * and why go I mourning, whilst my enemy afflicteth me?
41:12 Whilst my bones are broken, * my enemies who trouble me have reproached me;
41:12 Whilst they say to me day by day: Where is thy God? * Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why dost thou disquiet me?
41:12 Hope thou in God, for I will still give praise to him: * the salvation of my countenance, and my God.
