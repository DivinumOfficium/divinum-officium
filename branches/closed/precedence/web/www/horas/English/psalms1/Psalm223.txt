(Canticle of_Anna * 1 Sam 2:1-16)
2:1 My heart hath rejoiced in the Lord, * and my horn is exalted in my God:
2:2 My mouth is enlarged over my enemies: * because I have joyed in thy salvation.
2:3 There is none holy as the Lord is: for there is no other beside thee, * and there is none strong like our God.
2:4 Do not multiply to speak lofty things, * boasting:
2:5 Let old matters depart from your mouth: for the Lord is a God of all knowledge, * and to him are thoughts prepared.
2:6 The bow of the mighty is overcome, * and the weak are girt with strength.
2:7 They that were full before have hired out themselves for bread: * and the hungry are filled,
2:8 So that the barren hath borne many: * and she that had many children is weakened.
2:9 The Lord killeth and maketh alive, * he bringeth down to hell and bringeth back again.
2:10 The Lord maketh poor and maketh rich, * he humbleth and he exalteth.
2:11 He raiseth up the needy from the dust, * and lifteth up the poor from the dunghill:
2:12 That he may sit with princes, * and hold the throne of glory.
2:13 For the poles of the earth are the Lord’s, * and upon them he hath set the world.
2:14 He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness, * because no man shall prevail by his own strength.
2:15 The adversaries of the Lord shall fear him: * and upon them shall he thunder in the heavens.
2:16 The Lord shall judge the ends of the earth, and he shall give empire to his king, * and shall exalt the horn of his Christ.
