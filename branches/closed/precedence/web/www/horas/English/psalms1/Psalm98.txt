98:1 The Lord hath reigned, let the people be angry: * he that sitteth on the cherubims: let the earth be moved.
98:2 The Lord is great in Sion, * and high above all people.
98:3 Let them give praise to thy great name: for it is terrible and holy: * and the king’s honour loveth judgment.
98:4 Thou hast prepared directions: * thou hast done judgment and justice in Jacob.
98:5 Exalt ye the Lord our God, and adore his footstool, * for it is holy.
98:6 Moses and Aaron among his priests: * and Samuel among them that call upon his name.
98:7 They called upon the Lord, and he heard them: * he spoke to them in the pillar of the cloud.
98:8 They kept his testimonies, * and the commandment which he gave them.
98:9 Thou didst hear them, O Lord our God: * thou wast a merciful God to them, and taking vengeance on all their inventions.
98:10 Exalt ye the Lord our God, and adore at his holy mountain: * for the Lord our God is holy.
