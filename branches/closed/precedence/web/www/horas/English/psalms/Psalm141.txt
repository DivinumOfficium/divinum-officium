141:1 (Of understanding for David, A prayer when he was in the cave. [1 Kings 24.])
141:2 I cried to the Lord with my voice: with my voice I made supplication to the Lord.
141:3 In his sight I pour out my prayer, and before him I declare my trouble:
141:4 When my spirit failed me, then thou knewest my paths. In this way wherein I walked, they have hidden a snare for me.
141:5 I looked on my right hand, and beheld, and there was no one that would know me. Flight hath failed me: and there is no one that hath regard to my soul.
141:6 I cried to thee, O Lord: I said: Thou art my hope, my portion in the land of the living.
141:7 Attend to my supplication: for I am brought very low. Deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.
141:8 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the just wait for me, until thou reward me.
