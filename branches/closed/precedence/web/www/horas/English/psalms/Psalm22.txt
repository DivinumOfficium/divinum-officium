22:1 (A psalm for David.) The Lord ruleth me: and I shall want nothing.
22:2 He hath set me in a place of pasture. He hath brought me up, on the water of refreshment:
22:3 He hath converted my soul. He hath led me on the paths of justice, for his own name's sake.
22:4 For though I should walk in the midst of the shadow of death, I will fear no evils, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they have comforted me.
22:5 Thou hast prepared a table before me against them that afflict me. Thou hast anointed my head with oil; and my chalice which inebreateth me, how goodly is it!
22:6 And thy mercy will follow me all the days of my life. And that I may dwell in the house of the Lord unto length of days.
