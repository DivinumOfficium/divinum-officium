(Canticum Habacuc * Hab 3:7-12)
3:7 I saw the tents of Ethiopia for their iniquity, the curtains of the land of Madian shall be troubled.
3:8 Wast thou angry, O Lord, with the rivers? or was thy wrath upon the rivers? or thy indignation in the sea? Who will ride upon thy horses: and thy chariots are salvation.
3:9 Thou wilt surely take up thy bow: according to the oaths which thou hast spoken to the tribes. Thou wilt divide the rivers of the earth.
3:10 The mountains saw thee, and were grieved: the great body of waters passed away. The deep put forth its voice: the deep lifted up its hands.
3:11 The sun and the moon stood still in their habitation, in the light of thy arrows, they shall go in the brightness of thy glittering spear.
3:12 In thy anger thou wilt tread the earth under foot: in thy wrath thou wilt astonish the nations.
