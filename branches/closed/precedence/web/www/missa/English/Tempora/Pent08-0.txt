[Lectio]
Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Romans
!Rom 8:12-17
Brethren: We are debtors, not to the flesh, that we should live according to the flesh, for if you live according to the flesh you will die; but if by the spirit you put to death the deeds of the flesh, you will live. For whoever are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. Now you have not received a spirit of bondage so as to be again in fear, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons, by virtue of which we cry, Abba! Father! The Spirit Himself gives testimony to our spirit that we are sons of God. But if we are sons, we are heirs also: heirs indeed of God and joint heirs with Christ.

[Graduale]

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 16:1-9
At that time, Jesus spoke to His disciples this parable: There was a certain~
rich man who had a steward, who was reported to him as squandering his~
possessions. And he called him and said to him, ‘What is this that I hear of~
you? Make an accounting of your stewardship, for you can be steward no longer.’~
And the steward said within himself, ‘What shall I do, seeing that my master is~
taking away the stewardship from me? To dig I am not able; to beg I am ashamed. I~
know what I shall do, that when I am removed from my stewardship they may~
receive me into their houses.’ And he summoned each of his master’s debtors and~
said to the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’ And he said, ‘A hundred jars~
of oil.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bond and sit down at once and write fifty.’~
Then he said to another, ‘How much do you owe?’ He said, ‘A hundred kors of~
wheat.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bond and write eighty.’ And the master~
commended the unjust steward, in that he had acted prudently; for the children~
of this world, in relation to their own generation, are more prudent than the~
children of the light. And I say to you, make friends for yourselves with the~
mammon of wickedness, so that when you fail they may receive you into the~
everlasting dwellings.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 17:28, 32.
Lowly people You save, O Lord, but haughty eyes You bring low; for who is God~
except You, O Lord?

[Secreta]
Accept, we beseech You, O Lord, the gifts which we bring to You out of Your own~
bounty, so that these most holy sacramental rites may, by the power of Your~
grace, sanctify us in the conduct of our present life, and lead us to~
everlasting joy.
