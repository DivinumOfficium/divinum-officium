[Oratio]
O God, Who in a wondrous way graciously urged blessed John, Your Confessor, to~
propagate Your faith among the pagans, and through him brought together a new~
religious family in Your Church for the education of the faithful, grant Your~
servants so to profit by his teaching that we may reach everlasting rewards.

Lesson from the second letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians
!2 Cor 4:1-6; 4:15-18
Brethren: Discharging this ministry in accordance with the mercy shown us, we do not lose heart. On the contrary, we renounce those practices which shame conceals, we avoid unscrupulous conduct, we do not corrupt the word of God; but making known the truth, we commend ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God. And if our Gospel also is veiled, it is veiled only to those who are perishing. In their case, the god of this world has blinded their unbelieving minds, that they should not see the light of the Gospel of the glory of Christ, Who is the image of God. For we preach not of ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves merely as your servants in Jesus. For God, Who commanded light to shine out of darkness, has shone in our hearts to give enlightenment concerning the knowledge of the glory of God, shining on the face of Christ Jesus. For all things are for your sakes, so that the grace which abounds through the many may cause thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God. Wherefore we do not lose heart. On the contrary, even though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day. For our present light affliction, which is for the moment, prepares for us an eternal weight of glory that is beyond all measure; while we look not at the things that are seen, but at the things that are not seen. For the things that are seen are temporal, but the things that are not seen are eternal.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 10:1-9
 At that time, the Lord appointed seventy-two others, and sent them forth two by~
two before Him into every town and place where He Himself was about to come. And~
He said to them, The harvest indeed is great, but the laborers are few. Pray~
therefore the Lord of the harvest to send forth laborers into His harvest. Go.~
Behold, I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves. Carry neither purse,~
nor wallet, nor sandals, and greet no one on the way. Whatever house you enter,~
first say, ‘Peace to this house!’ And if a son of peace be there, your peace~
will rest upon him; but if not, it will return to you. And remain in the same~
house, eating and drinking what they have; for the laborer deserves his wages.~
Do not go from house to house. And whatever town you enter, and they receive you,~
eat what is set before you, and cure the sick who are there, and say to them,~
‘The kingdom of God is at hand for you.’

!Col 1:25
