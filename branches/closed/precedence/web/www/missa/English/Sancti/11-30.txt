Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Romans
!Rom 10:10-18
Brethren: With the heart a man believes unto justice, and with the mouth profession of faith is made unto salvation. For the Scripture says, Whoever believes in Him shall not be disappointed. For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for there is the same Lord of all, rich toward all who call upon Him. For whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. How then are they to call upon Him in Whom they have not believed? But how are they to believe Him Whom they have not heard? And how are they to hear, if no one preaches? And how are men to preach unless they be sent? As it is written, How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the Gospel of peace; of those who bring glad tidings of good things! But all did not obey the Gospel. For Isaias says, Lord, who has believed our report? Faith, then, depends on hearing, and hearing on the word of Christ. But I say: Have they not heard? Yes, indeed, Their voice has gone forth into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.

[Graduale]
!Ps 44:17-18
You shall make them princes through all the land; they shall remember Your name, O~
Lord.
V. The place of your fathers your sons shall have; therefore shall nations~
praise You. Alleluia, alleluia.
V. The Lord loved Andrew in an odor of sweetness. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 4:18-22
 At that time, as Jesus was walking by the sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers,~
Simon, who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the sea~
- for they were fishermen -. And He said to them, Come, follow Me, and I will make~
you fishers of men. And at once they left the nets, and followed Him. And going~
farther on, He saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and his brother~
John, in a boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and He called~
them. And immediately they left their nets and their father, and followed him.

!Ps 138:17
To me, Your friends, O God, are made exceedingly honorable; their principality~
is exceedingly strengthened.

O Lord, we beseech You, that the holy prayer of blessed Andrew may make our~
sacrifice pleasing to You, so that it would be acceptable to You, through the~
merits of him in whose honor it is solemnly offered.

You, may it bring about our forgiveness.
