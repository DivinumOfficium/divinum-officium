Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians
!Eph 3:8-9, 14-19.
Brethren: To me, the very least of all saints, there was given this grace to announce among the Gentiles the good tidings of the unfathomable riches of Christ, and to enlighten all men as to what is the dispensation of the mystery which has been hidden from eternity in God, Who created all things. For this reason I bend my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, from Whom all fatherhood in heaven and on earth receives its name, that He may grant you from His glorious riches to be strengthened with power through His Spirit unto the progress of the inner man; and to have Christ dwelling through faith in your hearts: so that, being rooted and grounded in love, you may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know Christ’s love which surpasses knowledge, in order that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.

[Graduale]
!Cant 8:7
Deep waters cannot quench love, nor floods sweep it away.
!Ps 72:26
V. My flesh and my heart waste away; God is the God of my heart and my portion~
forever. Alleluia, alleluia.
!Cant. 7:10
V. I belong to my lover and for me He yearns. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 11:25-30
At that time, Jesus spoke and said, I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and~
earth, that You hid these things from the wise and prudent, and revealed them to~
little ones. Yes, Father, for such was Your good pleasure. All things have been~
delivered to Me by My Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father; nor~
does anyone know the Father except the Son, and him to whom the Son chooses to~
reveal Him. Come to Me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will give you~
rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn from Me, for I am meek and humble of~
heart; and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden~
light.

[Offertorium]
!Zach 9:17
What wealth is His, and what beauty! grain that makes the chosen ones flourish,~
and new wine, the maidens.

[Secreta]
May the gifts of Your people be acceptable to You, O Lord, and grant that we be~
enkindled with that divine fire radiating from the Heart of Your Son, which~
burned so fervently in blessed Margaret.

[Communio]
!Cant 6:2
I belong to my lover and my lover to me; He browses among the lilies.

[Postcommunio]
Having received the sacrament of Your Body and Blood, we beseech You, O Lord~
Jesus, grant us by the intercession of blessed Margaret Mary, the Virgin, that,~
stripping ourselves of worldly vanities, we may be found worthy to put on the~
meekness and humility of Your Heart.
