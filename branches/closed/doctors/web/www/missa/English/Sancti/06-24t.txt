Lesson from the book of Isaias
!Isa 49:1-3, 5-7.
Hear me, O coastlands, listen, O distant peoples. The Lord called me from birth, from my mother’s womb He gave me my name. He made of me a sharp-edged sword and concealed me in the shadow of His arm. He made me a polished arrow, in His quiver He hid me. You are My servant, He said to me, Israel, through whom I show My glory. And now says the Lord Who formed me as His servant from the womb, I will make you a light to the nations, that My salvation may reach to the ends of the earth. When kings shall see you, they shall stand up, and princes shall prostrate themselves because of the Lord, the Holy One of Israel Who has chosen you.

Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you; and before you were born, I~

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 1:57-68
Elizabeth’s time was fulfilled that she should be delivered, and she brought~
forth a son. And her neighbors and kinsfolk heard that the Lord had magnified~
His mercy toward her, and they rejoiced with her. And it came to pass on the~
eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to call~
him by his father’s name, Zachary. And his mother answered and said, Not so, but~
he shall be called John. And they said to her, There is none of your kindred~
that is called by this name. And they kept inquiring by signs of his father what~
he would have him called. And asking for a writing-tablet he wrote the words,~
John is his name. And they all marveled. And immediately his mouth was opened~
and his tongue loosed, and he began to speak, blessing God. And fear came on all~
their neighbors; and all these things were spoken abroad in all the hill country~
of Judea. And all who heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, What then~
will this child be? For the hand of the Lord was with him. And Zachary his~
father was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying, Blessed be the~
Lord, the God of Israel, because He has visited and wrought redemption for His~
people.
