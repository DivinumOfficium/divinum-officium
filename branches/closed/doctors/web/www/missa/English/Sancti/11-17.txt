Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus
!Ecclus 44:16-27: 45:3- 20.
Behold, a great priest, who in his days pleased God, and was found just; and in the time of wrath he was made a reconciliation. There was not found the like to him, who kept the law of the Most High. Therefore, by an oath, the Lord made him to increase among his people. He gave him the blessing of all nations, and confirmed His covenant upon his head. He acknowledged him in His blessings; He preserved for him His mercy; and he found grace before the eyes of the Lord. He glorified him in the sight of kings, and gave him a crown of glory. He made an everlasting covenant with him, and gave him a great priesthood; and made him blessed in glory. To execute the office of the priesthood, and to have praise in His name, and to offer Him a worthy incense for an odor of sweetness.

At that time, Jesus answered and said to His disciples, Have faith in God. Amen I~
say to you, whoever says to this mountain, ‘Arise, and hurl yourself into the~
sea,’ and does not waver in his heart, but believes that whatever he says will~
be done, it shall be done for him. Therefore I say to you, all things whatever~
you ask for in prayer, believe that you shall receive, and they shall come to~
you.
