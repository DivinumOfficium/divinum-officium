Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Galatians
!Gal 3:16-22
Brethren: The promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. He does not say, And to his offsprings, as of many; but as of one, And to your offspring, Who is Christ. Now I mean this: The Law which was made four hundred and thirty years later does not annul the covenant which was ratified by God, so as to make the promise void. For if the right to inherit be from the Law, it is no longer from a promise. But God gave it to Abraham by promise. What then was the Law? It was enacted on account of transgressions, being delivered by angels through a mediator, until the offspring should come to whom the promise was made. Now there is no intermediary where there is only one; but God is one. Is the Law then contrary to the promises of God? By no means. For if a law had been given that could give life, justice would truly be from the Law. But the Scriptures shut up all things under sin, that by the faith of Jesus Christ the promise might be given to those who believe.

[Graduale]

ones.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 17:11-19
At that time, Jesus was going to Jerusalem, He was passing between Samaria and~
Galilee. And as He was entering a certain village, there He met ten lepers, who~
stood afar off and lifted up their voice, crying, Jesus, Master, have pity on~
us. And when He saw them He said, Go, show yourselves to the priests. And it~
came to pass as they were on their way, that they were made clean. But one of~
them, seeing that he was made clean, returned, with a loud voice glorifying God,~
and he fell on his face at His feet, giving thanks; and he was a Samaritan. But~
Jesus answered and said, Were not the ten made clean? But where are the nine?~
Has no one been found to return and give glory to God, except this foreigner?~
And He said to him, Arise, go your way, for your faith has saved you.

[Offertorium]

My trust is in You, O Lord; I say, You are my God. In Your hands is my destiny..

[Secreta]
Look with favor upon Your people, O Lord, look with favor upon their gifts; so~
that, appeased by this offering, You will grant us pardon and give us what we~
ask.
