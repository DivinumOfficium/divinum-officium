Lesson from the first letter of St John the Apostle
!1 John 3:13-18.
Beloved: Do not be surprised if the world hates you. We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love abides in death. Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer. And you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. In this we have come to know His love, that He laid down His life for us; and we likewise ought to lay down our life for the brethren. He who has the goods of this world and sees his brother in need and closes his heart to him, how does the love of God abide in him? My dear children, let us not love in word, neither with the tongue, but in deed and in truth.

me. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 14:16-24.
At that time, Jesus spoke to the Pharisees this parable: A certain man gave a~
great supper, and he invited many. And he sent his servant at supper time to~
tell those invited to come, for everything is now ready. And they all with one~
accord began to excuse themselves. The first said to him, ‘I have bought a farm,~
and I must go out and see it; I pray you hold me excused.’ And another said, ‘I~
have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am on my way to try them; I pray you hold~
me excused.’ And another said, ‘I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot~
come.’ And the servant returned, and reported these things to his master. Then~
the master of the house was angry and said to his servant, ‘Go out quickly into~
the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor, and the crippled,~
and the blind, and the lame.’ And the servant said, ‘Sir, your order has been~
carried out, and still there is room.’ Then the master said to the servant, ‘Go~
out into the highways and hedges, and make them come in, so that my house may be~
filled. For I tell you that none of those who were invited shall taste of my~
supper.’

[Offertorium]

Return, O Lord, save my life; rescue me because of Your kindness.
