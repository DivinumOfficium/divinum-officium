Evangélium szent János Apostol kõnyvébõl
!John 1:35-51
Abban az idõben ott állt János két tanítványával, s mihelyt meglátta Jézust,~
amint közeledett, így szólt: Nézzétek, az Isten Báránya! És így tovább.

Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!7th Tract on John
Since John was the friend of the Bridegroom, (iii. 29,) he sought not his own~
glory, but bare witness to the truth. Would he that his disciples should remain~
with him rather than that they should follow the Lord? Nay, he showed his~
disciples Whom they should follow. They thought that he himself was the Lamb;~
but he saith Why wait ye on me? I am not the Lamb. Behold the Lamb of God! '*'~
This was He of Whom he had already said above (29) Behold the Lamb of God! And~
what use to us is the Lamb of God? Behold the Lamb of God, saith John, Which~
taketh away the sin of the world. And the two disciples heard him speak, and~
they followed Jesus.

[Lectio2]
Let us see what followed. John stood, and two of his disciples; and looking on~
Jesus as He walked, he saith Behold the Lamb of God! And the two disciples~
heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. They followed Him, not yet to cleave~
unto Him, for it is manifest that they clave unto Him only after that He had~
called them out of the ship. (Matth. iv. 18.) One of the two which heard John~
speak, and followed Him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. And we know how it~
is written in the Gospel of Matthew: Jesus walking by the sea of Galilee, saw~
two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the~
sea, for they were fishers. And He saith unto them Follow Me, and I will make~
you fishers of men. And they straightway left their nets and followed Him.

[Lectio3]
From that time, therefore, was it that they clave unto Him continuously. Then~
Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them What seek ye? They~
said unto Him Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where~
dwellest Thou? So they follow Him now, not as to cleave unto Him for ever, but~
as to know where He dwelt, and to obey that which is written If thou see a man~
of understanding, go to him early in the morning, and let thy foot wear the~
steps of his doors. (Ecclus. vi. 36.) He saith unto them Come and see. They~
came and saw where He dwelt, and abode with Him that day. O what a blessed day! O~
what a blessed night! for it was about the tenth hour. Who shall tell what they~
heard from the Lord? O let us also build an house in our hearts, where He may~
come, and teach us, and talk with us!

[Oratio]
Grant, we beseech thee, O Almighty God, that thy blessed Apostle Andrew, on the~
Eve of whose Feast we now are, may entreat for us the healthful succour of thy~
mercy, that we, being delivered from all guiltiness, may likewise be delivered~
from all dangers.
