From the letter of blessed Apostle Paul to the Romans
!Rom 8:12-16
 8:12 Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.
8:13 For if you live according to the flesh, you shall die: but if by the Spirit you mortify the deeds of the flesh, you shall live.
8:14 For whosoever are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
8:15 For you have not received the spirit of bondage again in fear; but you have received the spirit of adoption of sons, whereby we cry: Abba (Father).
8:16 For the Spirit himself giveth testimony to our spirit, that we are the sons of God.

[Lectio2]
!Rom 8:17-20
8:17 And if sons, heirs also; heirs indeed of God, and joint heirs with Christ: yet so, if we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified with him.
8:18 For I reckon that the sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared with the glory to come, that shall be revealed in us.
8:19 For the expectation of the creature waiteth for the revelation of the sons of God.
8:20 For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him that made it subject, in hope:

[Lectio3]
!Rom 8:21-25
8:21 Because the creature also itself shall be delivered from the servitude of corruption, into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.
8:22 For we know that every creature groaneth and travaileth in pain, even till now.
8:23 And not only it, but ourselves also, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption of the sons of God, the redemption of our body.
8:24 For we are saved by hope. But hope that is seen, is not hope. For what a man seeth, why doth he hope for?
8:25 But if we hope for that which we see not, we wait for it with patience.
