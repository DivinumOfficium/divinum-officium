12:1 (Unto the end, a psalm for David. How long, O Lord, wilt thou forget me unto the end? how long dost thou turn away thy face from me?)
12:2 How long shall I take counsels in my soul, sorrow in my heart all the day?
12:3 How long shall my enemy be exalted over Me?
12:4 Consider, and hear me, O Lord, my God. Enlighten my eyes, that I never sleep in death:
12:5 Lest at any time my enemy say: I have prevailed against him. They that trouble me, will rejoice when I am moved:
12:6 But I have trusted in thy mercy. My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation: I will sing to the Lord, who giveth me good things: yea, I will sing to the name of the Lord, the most high.
