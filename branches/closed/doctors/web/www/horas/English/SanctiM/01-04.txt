[Lectio1]
From the letter of blessed Apostle Paul to the Romans
!Rom 6:16-18
 6:16 Know you not, that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants you are whom you obey, whether it be of sin unto death, or of obedience unto justice.
6:17 But thanks be to God, that you were the servants of sin, but have obeyed from the heart, unto that form of doctrine, into which you have been delivered.
6:18 Being then freed from sin, we have been made servants of justice.

!Rom 5:6-9
6:19 I speak an human thing, because of the infirmity of your flesh. For as you have yielded your members to serve uncleanness and iniquity, unto iniquity; so now yield your members to serve justice, unto sanctification.
6:20 For when you were the servants of sin, you were free men to justice.

!Rom 6:21-23
 6:21 What fruit therefore had you then in those things, of which you are now ashamed? For the end of them is death.

6:23 For the wages of sin is death. But the grace of God, life everlasting, in Christ Jesus our Lord.
