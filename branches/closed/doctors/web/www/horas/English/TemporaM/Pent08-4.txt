Lesson from the first book of Kings
!1 Kgs 12:1-5
1 And Roboam went to Sichem: for thither were all Israel come together to make~
him king.
2 But Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who was yet in Egypt, a fugitive from the face~
of king Solomon, hearing of his death, returned out of Egypt.
3 And they sent and called him: and Jeroboam came, and all the multitude of~
Israel, and they spoke to Roboam, saying:
4 thy father laid a grievous yoke upon us: now therefore do thou take off a~
little of the grievous service of thy father, and of his most heavy yoke, which~
he put upon us, and we will serve thee.
5 And he said to them: Go till the third day, and come to me again.

!1 Kgs 12:5-8
5 And when the people was gone,
6 King Roboam took counsel with the old men, that stood before Solomon his~
father while he yet lived, and he said: What counsel do you give me, that I may~
answer this people?
7 They said to him: If thou wilt yield to this people today, and condescend to~
them, and grant their petition, and wilt speak gentle words to them, they will~
be thy servants always.
8 But he left the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and~
consulted with the young men, that had been brought up with him, and stood~
before him.

!1 Kgs 12:13-16
13 And the king answered the people roughly, leaving the counsel of the old men,~
which they had given him,
14 And he spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying: My~
father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke: my father beat you~
with whips, but I will beat you with scorpions.
15 And the king condescended not to the people: for the Lord was turned away~
from him, to make good his word, which he had spoken in the hand of Ahias the~
Silonite, to Jeroboam the son of Nabat.
16 Then the people seeing that the king would not hearken to them, answered him,~
saying: What portion have we in David? or what inheritance in the son of Isai?~
Go home to thy dwellings, O Israel, now David look to thy own house. So Israel~
departed to their dwellings.
