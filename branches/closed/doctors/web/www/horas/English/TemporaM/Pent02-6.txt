Lesson from the first book of Samuel
!1 Sam 8:1-4
1 Now I there was a man of Benjamin whose name was Cis, the son of Abiel, the~
son of Seror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphia, the son of a man of Jemini,~
valiant and strong.
2 And he had a son whose name was Saul, a choice and goodly man, and there was~
not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders~
and upward he appeared above all the people.
3 And the asses of Cis, Sauls father, were lost: and Cis said to his son Saul:~
Take one of the servants with thee, and arise, go, and seek the asses. And when~
they had passed through mount Ephraim,
4 And through the land of Salisa, and had not found them, they passed also~
through the land of Salim, and they were not there: and through the land of~
Jemini, and found them not.

!1 Sam 8:5-13
5 And when they were come to the land of Suph, Saul said to the servant that was~
with him: Come, let us return, lest perhaps my father forget the asses, and be~
concerned for us.
6 And he said to him: Behold there is a man of God in this city, a famous man:~
all that he saith, cometh certainly to pass. Now therefore let us go thither,~
perhaps he may tell us of our way, for which we are come.
7 And Saul said to his servant: Behold we will go: but what shall we carry to~
the man of God? the bread is spent in our bags: and we have no present to make~
to the man of God, nor any thing at all.
8 The servant answered Saul again, and said: Behold there is found in my hand~
the fourth part of a sicle of silver, let us give it to the man of God, that he~
may tell us our way.
9 Now in time past, in Israel when a man went to consult God he spoke thus: Come,~
let us go to the seer. For he that is now called a prophet, in time past was~
called a seer.
10 And Saul said to his servant: thy word is very good, come, let us go. And~
they went into the city, where the man of God was.
11 And when they went up the ascent to the city, they found maids coming out to~
draw water, and they said to them: Is the seer here?
12 They answered and said to them: He is: behold he is before you, make haste~
now: for he came today into the city, for there is a sacrifice of the people~
today in the high place.
13 As soon as you come into the city, you shall immediately find him, before he~
go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat till he come:~
because he blesseth the victim, and afterwards they eat that are invited. Now~
therefore go up, for today you shall find him.

!1 Sam 8:14-17
14 And they went up into the city. And when they were walking in the midst of~
the city, behold Samuel was coming out over against them, to go up to the high~
place.
15 Now the Lord had revealed to the ear of Samuel the day before Saul came,~
saying:
16 Tomorrow about this same hour I will send thee a man of the land of Benjamin,~
and thou shalt anoint him to be ruler over my people Israel: and he shall save~
my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked down upon my~
people, because their cry is come to me.
17 And when Samuel saw Saul, the Lord said to him: Behold the man, of whom I~
spoke to thee, this man shall reign over my people
