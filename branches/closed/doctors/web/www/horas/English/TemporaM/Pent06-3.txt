!2 Sam 15:1-3
1 Now after these things Absalom made himself chariots, and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.
2 And Absalom rising up early stood by the entrance of the gate, and when any man had business to come to the king's judgment, Absalom called him to him, and said: Of what city art thou? He answered, and said: thy servant is of such a tribe of Israel.
3 And Absalom answered him: thy words seem to me good and just. But there is no man appointed by the king to hear thee.

!2 Sam 15:3-6
And Absalom said:
4 O that they would make me judge over the land, that all that have business~
might come to me, that I might do them justice.
5 Moreover when any man came to him to salute him, he put forth his hand, and~
took him, and kissed him.
6 And this he did to all Israel that came for judgment, to be heard by the king,~
and he enticed the hearts of the men of Israel.

!2 Sam 15:7-10
7 And after forty years, Absalom said to king David: Let me go, and pay my vows~
which I have vowed to the Lord in Hebron.
8 For thy servant made avow, when he was in Gessur of Syria, saying: If the Lord~
shall bring me again into Jerusalem I will offer sacrifice to the Lord.
9 And king David said to him: Go in peace. And he arose, and went to Hebron.
10 And Absalom sent spies into all the tribes of Israel, saying: As soon as you~
shall hear the sound of the trumpet, say ye: Absalom reigneth in Hebron.
