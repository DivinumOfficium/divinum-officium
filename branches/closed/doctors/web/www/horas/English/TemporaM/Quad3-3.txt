From the holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 15:1-20
In that time came to Jesus from Jerusalem scribes and Pharisees, saying: Why do~
thy disciples trangress the tradition of the ancients? And so on.
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Bk. ii. Comm. on Matth. xv.
The stupidity of the Pharisees and Scribes is something extraordinary. They~
rebuke the Son of God because He doth not observe the traditions and~
commandments of men for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. It~
behoveth us to cleanse, not the hands of the body, but the hands of the soul,~
namely, our works, that we may do the commandments of God. But He answered and~
said unto them Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your~
tradition? He meeteth here their false accusation by a true. ' How,' saith He,~
'do ye, who pass over the commandments of God, in order to keep to the~
traditions of men, hold that My disciples are to be rebuked, because they deem~
the tradition of the elders of little moment in comparison with the doing of~
what they know to be the Laws of God? '

Now God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother; and, He that curseth~
father or mother, let him die the death. But ye say Whosoever shall say to his~
father or his mother It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by~
me; and honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. The word honour~
is used in Scripture, not so much in the sense of paying salutations and~
services, as in that of giving alms and gifts. Honour widows, saith the Apostle,~
which are widows indeed. (1 Tim. v. 3.) And here honour signifieth support. So~
again, (17, 18): Let the Priests that rule well be counted worthy of double~
honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine. For the Scripture~
saith ' Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn ' and '~
The labourer is worthy of his reward.'

The Lord being mindful of the helplessness, or age, or poverty of parents, had~
commanded their children to honour them even by giving them the necessaries of~
life. The Scribes and Pharisees, scrupling not to make of none effect this most~
benign law, and bringing in ungodliness under the very form of godliness, taught,~
for the benefit of unnatural children, that if any one vowed to God, Who is our~
very Father in heaven, whatsoever he was bound to give to his parents, the duty~
of discharging his debt to his heavenly Father ought to come before that which~
he owed to his earthly father; or, at least, that parents in such case incurred~
the guilt of sacrilege by taking for themselves what they knew had been made a~
gift to God. And so parents were left unsuccoured, and the offerings of such~
children, under pretence of being given to God and His temple, became the gain~
of the Priests.

v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 15:1-20
15:1 THEN came to him from Jerusalem scribes and Pharisees, saying:
15:2 Why do thy disciples trangress the tradition of the ancients? For they wash not their hands when they eat bread.
15:3 But he answering, said to them: Why do you also transgress the commandment of God for your tradition? For God said:
15:4 Honour thy father and mother: And: He that shall curse father or mother, let him die the death.
15:5 But you say: Whosoever shall say to father or mother, The gift whatsoever proceedeth from me, shall profit thee.
15:6 And he shall not honour his father or his mother: and you have made void the commandment of God for your tradition.
15:7 Hypocrites, well hath Isaias prophesied of you, saying:
15:8 This people honoureth me with their lips: but their heart is far from me.
15:9 And in vain do they worship me, teaching doctrines and commandments of men.
15:10 And having called together the multitudes unto him, he said to them: Hear ye and understand.
15:11 Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man: but what cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.
15:12 Then came his disciples, and said to him: Dost thou know that the Pharisees, when they heard this word, were scandalized?
15:13 But he answering them, said: Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.
15:14 Let them alone: they are blind, and leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into the pit.
15:15 And Peter answering, said to him: Expound to us this parable.
15:16 But he said: Are you also yet without understanding?
15:17 Do you not understand, that whatsoever entereth into the mouth, goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the privy?
15:18 But the things which proceed out of the mouth, come forth from the heart, and those things defile a man.
15:19 For from the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, blasphemies.
15:20 These are the things that defile a man. But to eat with unwashed hands doth not defile a man.
