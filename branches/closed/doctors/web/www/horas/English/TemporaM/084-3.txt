[Lectio1]
From the Book of Ecclesiasticus
!Sir 3:1-4
1 The sons of wisdom are the church of the just: and their generation, obedience~
and love.
2 Children, hear the judgment of your father, and so do that you may be saved.
3 For God hath made the father honourable to the children: and seeking the~
judgment of the mothers, hath confirmed it upon the children.
4 He that loveth God, shall obtain pardon for his sins by prayer, and shall~
refrain himself from them, and shall be heard in the prayer of days.

!Sir 3:5-8
5 And he that honoureth his mother is as one that layeth up a treasure.
6 He that honoureth his father shall have joy in his own children, and in the~
day of his prayer he shall be heard.
7 He that honoureth his father shall enjoy a long life: and he that obeyeth the~
father, shall be a comfort to his mother.
8 He that feareth the Lord, honoureth his parents, and will serve them as his~
masters that brought him into the world.

!Sir 3:9-13
9 Honour thy father, in work and word, and all patience,
10 That a blessing may come upon thee from him, and his blessing may remain in~
the latter end.
11 The father's blessing establisheth the houses of the children: but the~
mother's curse rooteth up the foundation.
12 Glory not in the dishonour of thy father: for his shame is no glory to thee.
13 For the glory of a man is from the honour of his father, and a father without~
honour is the disgrace of the son.
