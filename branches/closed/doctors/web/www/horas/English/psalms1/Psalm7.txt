7:1 O Lord my God, in thee have I put my trust: * save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me.
7:2 Lest at any time he seize upon my soul like a lion, * while there is no one to redeem me, nor to save.
7:3 O Lord my God, if I have done this thing, * if there be iniquity in my hands:
7:4 If I have rendered to them that repaid me evils, * let me deservedly fall empty before my enemies.
7:5 Let the enemy pursue my soul, and take it, and tread down my life on the earth, * and bring down my glory to the dust.
7:6 Rise up, O Lord, in thy anger: * and be thou exalted in the borders of my enemies.
7:7 And arise, O Lord my God, in the precept which thou hast commanded: * and a congregation of people shall surround thee.
7:8 And for their sakes return thou on high. * The Lord judgeth the people.
7:9 Judge me, O Lord, according to my justice, * and according to my innocence in me.
7:10 The wickedness of sinners shall be brought to nought: and thou shalt direct the just: * the searcher of hearts and reins is God.
7:11 Just is my help from the Lord: * who saveth the upright of heart.
7:12 God is a just judge, strong and patient: * is he angry every day?
7:13 Except you will be converted, he will brandish his sword: * he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.
7:14 And in it he hath prepared the instruments of death, * he hath made ready his arrows for them that burn.
7:15 Behold he hath been in labour with injustice; * he hath conceived sorrow, and brought forth iniquity.
7:16 He hath opened a pit and dug it: * and he is fallen into the hole he made.
7:17 His sorrow shall be turned on his own head: * and his iniquity shall come down upon his crown.
7:18 I will give glory to the Lord according to his justice: * and will sing to the name of the Lord the most High.
