147:1 Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem: *praise thy God, O Sion. 
147:2 Because he hath strengthened the bolts of thy gates * he hath blessed thy children within thee. 
147:3 Who hath placed peace in thy borders: * and filleth thee with the fat of corn.
147:4 Who sendeth forth his speech to the earth: * his word runneth swiftly.
147:5 Who giveth snow like wool: * scattereth mists like ashes.
147:6 He sendeth his crystal like morsels: * who shall stand before the face of his cold?
147:7 He shall send out his word, and shall melt them: * his wind shall blow, and the waters shall run.
147:8 Who declareth his word to Jacob: * his justices and his judgments to Israel.
147:9 He hath not done in like manner to every nation: * and his judgments he hath not made manifest to them.
