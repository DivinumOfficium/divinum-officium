73:1 O God, why hast thou cast us off unto the end: * why is thy wrath enkindled against the sheep of thy pasture?
73:2 Remember thy congregation, * which thou hast possessed from the beginning.
73:3 The sceptre of thy inheritance which thou hast redeemed: * mount Sion in which thou hast dwelt.
73:4 Lift up thy hands against their pride unto the end; * see what things the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.
73:5 And they that hate thee have made their boasts, * in the midst of thy solemnity.
73:6 They have set up their ensigns for signs, * and they knew not both in the going out and on the highest top.
73:7 As with axes in a wood of trees, they have cut down at once the gates thereof, * with axe and hatchet they have brought it down.
73:8 They have set fire to thy sanctuary: * they have defiled the dwelling place of thy name on the earth.
73:9 They said in their heart, the whole kindred of them together: * Let us abolish all the festival days of God from the land.
73:9 Our signs we have not seen, there is now no prophet: * and he will know us no more.
73:10 How long, O God, shall the enemy reproach: * is the adversary to provoke thy name for ever?
73:11 Why dost thou turn away thy hand: and thy right hand * out of the midst of thy bosom for ever?
73:12 But God is our king before ages: * he hath wrought salvation in the midst of the earth.
73:13 Thou by thy strength didst make the sea firm: * thou didst crush the heads of the dragons in the waters.
73:14 Thou hast broken the heads of the dragon: * thou hast given him to be meat for the people of the Ethiopians.
73:15 Thou hast broken up the fountains and the torrents: * thou hast dried up the Ethan rivers.
73:16 Thine is the day, and thine is the night: * thou hast made the morning light and the sun.
73:17 Thou hast made all the borders of the earth: * the summer and the spring were formed by thee.
73:18 Remember this, the enemy hath reproached the Lord: * and a foolish people hath provoked thy name.
73:19 Deliver not up to beasts the souls that confess to thee: * and forget not to the end the souls of thy poor.
73:20 Have regard to thy covenant: * for they that are the obscure of the earth have been filled with dwellings of iniquity.
73:21 Let not the humble be turned away with confusion: * the poor and needy shall praise thy name.
73:22 Arise, O God, judge thy own cause: * remember thy reproaches with which the foolish man hath reproached thee all the day.
73:23 Forget not the voices of thy enemies: * the pride of them that hate thee ascendeth continually.
