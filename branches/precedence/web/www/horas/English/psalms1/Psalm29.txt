29:1 I will extol thee, O Lord, for thou hast upheld me: * and hast not made my enemies to rejoice over me.
29:2 O Lord my God, I have cried to thee, * and thou hast healed me.
29:3 Thou hast brought forth, O Lord, my soul from hell: * thou hast saved me from them that go down into the pit.
29:4 Sing to the Lord, O ye his saints: * and give praise to the memory of his holiness.
29:5 For wrath is in his indignation; * and life in his good will.
29:6 In the evening weeping shall have place, * and in the morning gladness.
29:7 And in my abundance I said: * I shall never be moved.
29:8 O Lord, in thy favour, * thou gavest strength to my beauty.
29:9 Thou turnedst away thy face from me, * and I became troubled.
29:10 To thee, O Lord, will I cry: * and I will make supplication to my God.
29:11 What profit is there in my blood, * whilst I go down to corruption?
29:12 Shall dust confess to thee, * or declare thy truth?
29:13 The Lord hath heard, and hath had mercy on me: * the Lord became my helper.
29:14 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into joy: * thou hast cut my sackcloth, and hast compassed me with gladness:
29:15 To the end that my glory may sing to thee, and I may not regret: * O Lord my God, I will give praise to thee for ever.
