Olvasmány Mózes elsõ könyvébõl
!Gen 39:1-6
1 Amikor Józsefet elvitték Egyiptomba, Potifár, a fáraó egyik tisztviselõje, a~
testõrség parancsnoka, egy egyiptomi ember vásárolta meg az izmaelitáktól, akik~
odavitték.
2 De az Úr Józseffel volt, s így minden sikerült neki. Urának, az egyiptominak a~
házában maradt.
3 Ura meglátta, hogy az Úr vele van és hogy az Úr sikerre segít mindent, amihez~
hozzáfog,
4 azért József kegyelmet talált szemében: neki kellett õt kiszolgálnia. Azután~
házának intézõjévé tette és egész vagyonát rábízta.
5 Attól az idõtõl kezdve, hogy vagyonának intézõjévé tette, az Úr József miatt~
megáldotta az egyiptomi házát. Az Úr áldása volt mindenen, ami a házban és a~
mezõn az övé volt.
6 Tehát egész vagyonát rábízta Józsefre, s nem törõdött semmivel, csak az~
étellel, amit evett. József amellett szép külsejû és szép arcú volt.

[Responsory1]
R. The people cried to Pharaoh for bread
* And he answered them Go unto Joseph. Alleluia.
V. The saving of our lives is in thy hand; only let us find grace in thy sight,~
and we will gladly be Pharaoh's servants.
R. And he answered them Go unto Joseph. Alleluia.

!Gen 41:37-43
37 A beszéd tetszett a fáraónak és minden szolgájának.
38 A fáraó így szólt szolgáihoz: "Találhatnánk más olyan embert ezen kívül,~
akiben Isten szelleme van?"
39 Azután a fáraó így szólt Józsefhez: "Mivel Isten mindezt tudtodra adta, azért~
nincs senki, aki olyan okos és bölcs volna, mint te.
40 Te állsz majd házam élén. Egész népem köteles engedelmeskedni parancsodnak,~
és én csak a trónommal foglak megelõzni."
41 A fáraó még ezt mondta Józsefnek: "Ezennel Egyiptom egész földje fölé~
rendellek."
42 Azután a fáraó levette pecsétgyûrûjét az ujjáról és József ujjára húzta,~
bíbor ruhába öltöztette, és aranyláncot akasztott a nyakába.
43 Végighordoztatta második kocsiján, s ezt kiáltották elõtte: "Vigyázat!" Így~
emelte õt Egyiptom egész földje fölé.

[Responsory2]
R. God hath made me as a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house.
* He hath made me great, to save much people alive. Alleluia.
V. Come unto me, and I wili give you all the good of the land of Egypt, and ye~
shall eat the fat of the land.
R. He hath made me great, to save much people alive. Alleluia.

!Gen 41:44-49
44 A fáraó még így szólt Józsefhez: "Én vagyok a fáraó. Akaratod ellenére senki~
ne mozdítsa kezét és lábát Egyiptom földjén."
45 A fáraó a Cofnát-Paneach nevet adta Józsefnek és feleségül adta neki Asznátot,~
Poti-Ferásznak, az oni papnak a lányát. Azután József bejárta Egyiptomot.
46 József 30 éves volt, amikor Egyiptom királya, a fáraó elõtt állt. József~
eltávozott a fáraótól és bejárta Egyiptom egész földjét.
47 A föld hét éven át bõségesen termett.
48 Õ összegyûjtött készletül minden fölösleget, ami Egyiptom földjén hét éven át~
adódott, és a városokba vitette. Minden városba behordatta a körülötte fekvõ~
földek termését.
49 József tehát felhalmozta a gabonát, mint a tenger fövényét, olyan tömegben,~
hogy le is mondott a megmérésérõl. Nem is lehetett megmérni.

[Responsory3]
R. Now shall I die happy, since I have seen thy face, and do leave thee behind~
me. I am not disappointed of seeing thee.
* The Lord hath showed me also thy seed. Alleluia.
V. He That hath fed me from my youth up, bless the lads, and let my name be~
named on them.
R. The Lord hath showed me also thy seed. Alleluia.
&Gloria
R. The Lord hath showed me also thy seed. Alleluia.

[Lectio4]
From the Sermons of St Bernardine of Siena.
!1st of St Joseph.)
When any special favours are conferred upon a reasonable being, it is the common~
rule that whenever the grace of God electeth such and such an one for such and~
such a grace, or for such and such an high post of duty, the person so elected~
receiveth all the gifts of grace which be needful for him in that state of life~
whereunto he is called, and receiveth them abundantly. Of this there is an~
excellent instance in the case of the holy Joseph, the socalled father of our~
Lord Jesus Christ, and the real husband of her, who is Queen of the world, and~
Lady of Angels. He had been elected by the Eternal Father to be the faithful~
nurse and warder of His two chief treasures, that is, His Son, and Joseph's own~
Wife. This duty Joseph faithfully discharged, and consequently the Lord hath~
said to him: Well done, thou good and faithful servant enter thou into the joy~
of thy Lord. (Matth. xxv. 21.)

[Responsory4]
R. Thou hast given me the shield of thy salvation, and thy right hand hath~
holden me up.
* My buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my refuge. Alleluia.
V. I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward.
R. My buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my refuge. Alleluia.

[Lectio5]
This man Joseph, if we compare him with the Universal Church of Christ, is he~
not that elect and chosen one, through whom, and under whom, Christ is orderly~
and honestly brought into the world? If, then, the Holy Universal Church be~
under a debt to the Virgin Mother, because it is through her that she hath been~
made to receive Christ, next to Mary she oweth love and worship to Joseph.~
Joseph is the key of the (Church of the Saints which were under the) Old~
Testament, in whose person the noble structure of Patriarchs and Prophets~
reacheth her completion and realiseth her promises. He is the only one of them~
who actually enjoyed in full fruition what God had been pleased to promise~
before to them. It is, therefore, with good reason that we see a type of him in~
that Patriarch Joseph who stored up corn for the people. But the second Joseph~
hath a more excellent dignity than the first, seeing that the first only gave to~
the Egyptians bread for the body, but the second was the watchful guardian for~
all the elect of that Living Bread Which came down from heaven, of Which~
whosoever eateth will never die.

[Responsory5]
R. He shall set his children under her shelter, and shall lodge under her~
branches by her shall he be covered from heat,
* And in her glory shall he dwell. Alleluia.
V. Trust in Him, ye congregation of the people, pour out your heart before Him.
R. And in her glory shall he dwell. Alleluia.

[Lectio6]
There can be no doubt that Christ still treateth Joseph in heaven with that~
familiarity, honour, and most high condescension which He paid him, like a Son~
to a father, while He walked among men; nay, rather, that He hath now crowned~
and completed those habits. We may very reasonably suspect that it was with a~
peculiar meaning that Christ said (to him) Enter thou into the joy of thy~
Lord. The joy of being blessed for ever entereth into the heart of man, but when~
the Lord said (to Joseph), Enter thou into joy, He probably meant mystically to~
bid him realise a joy which should not be within him only, but outside him also,~
above him, and below him, and all round about him, and overflowing him as it~
were a great bottomless pit of joy to swallow him up altogether. Therefore, O~
thou blessed Joseph! remember us! In thy helpful prayers, make intercession for~
us with Him Who vouchsafed to be supposed thy Son! Likewise, obtain some pity~
for us from that most blessed Maiden who was thy wife, and the Mother of Him,~
Who, with the Father and the Holy Ghost, liveth and reigneth, one God, world~
without end. Ámen.

[Responsory6]
R. Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear.
* Though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident. Alleluia.
V. My praise shall be continually of thee, for Thou art my strong refuge.
R.* Though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident. Alleluia.
&Gloria
R. Though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident. Alleluia.

Evangélium szent Lukács Evangélista kõnyvébõl
!Luke 3:21
Azon idõben történt, hogy amikor már az egész nép megkeresztelkedett és Jézus is~
fölvette a keresztséget, és amikor imádkozott, megnyílt az ég És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!Book ii. on the Harmony of the Evangelists.
And Jesus Himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed)~
the Son of Joseph. These words, as was supposed, were evidently here written for~
the correction of such as might think that the Lord was the Son of Joseph, in~
the same sense as other men are called the children of their fathers. Those who~
find any trouble in the fact that the ancestors reckoned downward by Matthew~
from David to Joseph, are other than those reckoned upward by Luke from Joseph~
to David, such, I say, as are troubled by this, may get over it by supposing~
that Joseph had two fathers; one, that is, who begat him, and another who~
adopted him. The custom of adopting children, whereby those who have none of~
their own surround themselves with a family, is very ancient, even among the~
people of God. Hence, Luke is understood to have included in his Gospel, under~
the name of father of Joseph, that, not of the father by whom he was begotten,~
but of him by whom he was adopted, and it is the ancestors of this adoptive~
father who are reckoned up as far as David.

[Responsory7]
R. Joseph, thou Son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife; for That~
Which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth a Son;
* And thou shalt call His Name Jesus. Alleluia.
V. For He shall save His people from their sins.
R. And thou shalt call His Name Jesus. Alleluia.

[Lectio8]
Thus since we are behoven to believe that what each of the Evangelists said was~
true, Matthew as well as Luke; and therefore that one of them nameth the father~
who begat, and the other, the father who adopted, Joseph; we naturally suppose~
that the Evangelist, who nameth the adoptive father, was he who abstaineth from~
using the term beget.Matthew beginneth (i. 2) Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac~
begat Jacob, and so on, always with the use of this word begat, till he cometh~
tö and Jacob begat Joseph. By the word which he useth he doth sufficiently~
indicate that the genealogy which he is giving is that of him who begat.

[Responsory8]
R. Arise, and take the young Child, and His Mother, and flee into Egypt;
* And be thou there until I bring thee word. Alleluia.
V. That it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophets,~
saying Out of Egypt have I called My Son.
R. And be thou there until I bring thee word. Alleluia.
&Gloria
R. And be thou there until I bring thee word. Alleluia.

[Lectio9]
Luke saith Joseph was the son of Heli, not Joseph was begotten of Heli; but even~
if he had said the latter, it would not have troubled this interpretation of~
ours, that one Evangelist nameth the natural, and the other the adoptive father~
of Joseph. It is not an outrageous thing to say that one who adopteth another~
hath begotten him, albeit he hath done it, not carnally, but by love. Even so~
hath God given to us the power to become His sons, albeit He hath not begotten~
us of His Own Nature and Substance, as He hath His Only - Begotten Son, but only~
reckoneth us, in His love, among His children.
