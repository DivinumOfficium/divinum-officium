Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Philippians
!Phil 3:17-21; 4:1-3
Brethren: Be imitators of me, and mark those who walk after the pattern you have in us. For many walk, of whom I have told you often and now tell you even weeping, that they are enemies of the Cross of Christ. Their end is ruin, their god is the belly, their glory is in their shame, they mind the things of earth. But our citizenship is in heaven from which also we eagerly await a Savior, our Lord Jesus Christ, Who will refashion the body of our lowliness, conforming it to the body of His glory by exerting the power by which He is able also to subject all things to Himself. So then, my brethren, beloved and longed for, my joy and my crown, stand fast thus in the Lord, beloved. I entreat Evodia and I exhort Syntyche to be of one mind in the Lord. And I beseech you also, my loyal comrade, help them, for they have toiled with me in the gospel, as have Clement and the rest of my fellow-workers whose names are in the book of life.

[Graduale]
!Ps 43:8-9
You saved us, O Lord, from our foes, and those who hated us You put to shame.

!Ps 129:1-2
Out of the depths I have cried to thee, O Lord: Lord, hear my prayer.
Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 9:18-26
At that time, as Jesus was speaking to the crowds, behold, a ruler came up and~
worshipped Him, saying, "Lord, my daughter has just now died; but come and lay~
Your hand upon her, and she will return to life." And Jesus arose and followed~
him, and so did His disciples. Now a woman who for twelve years had been~
suffering from hemorrhage, came up behind him and touched the tassel of His~
cloak saying to herself, "If I touch but His cloak I shall be saved." But Jesus,~
turning and seeing her, said, "Take courage, daughter; your faith has saved~
you." And the woman was restored to health from that moment. And when Jesus came~
to the ruler's house, and saw the flute players and the crowd making a din, He~
said, "Begone, the girl is asleep, not dead." And they laughed Him to scorn. But~
when the crowd had been put out, He went in and took her by the hand; and the~
girl arose. And the report of this spread throughout all that district.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 129:1-2
Out of the depths I cry to You, O Lord; Lord, hear my prayer! Out of the depths I~
cry to You, O Lord.

[Secreta]
We offer You O Lord, the sacrifice of praise that we may serve You even better,~
so that You may graciously complete what You have given us, Your undeserving~
servants.
