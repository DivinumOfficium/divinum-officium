Lesson from the book of Judith
!Judith 13:22, 25.
The Lord has blessed you by His power, Who by you has brought our enemies to nought. Blessed are you, O daughter, by the Lord the Most High God, above all women upon the earth. Blessed be the Lord Who made heaven and earth, because He has so magnified your name this day, that your praise shall not depart out of the mouth of men, who shall be mindful of the power of the Lord forever: for you have not spared your life by reason of the distress and tribulation of your people, but have prevented our ruin in the presence of our God.

[Sequentia]
At the Cross her station keeping,
Stood the mournful Mother weeping,
Close to Jesus to the last.
_
Through her heart, His sorrow sharing,
All His bitter anguish bearing
Now at length the sword had passed.
_
Oh, how sad and sore distressed
Was that Mother highly blessed
Of the sole begotten One!
_
Christ above in torment hangs,
She beneath beholds the pangs
Of her dying, glorious Son.
_
Is there one who would not weep
‘Whelmed in miseries so deep
Christ’s dear Mother’s pain untold.
_
Can the human heart refrain
From partaking in her pain,
In that Mother’s pain untold?
_
Bruised, derided, cursed, defiled,
She beheld her tender Child,
All with bloody scourges rent.
_
For the sins of His own nation
Saw Him hang in desolation
Till His spirit forth He sent.
_
O sweet Mother! fount of love,
Touch my spirit from above,
Make my heart with yours accord.
_
Make me feel as you have felt;
Make my soul to glow and melt
With the love of Christ, my Lord.
_
Holy Mother, pierce me through,
In my heart each wound renew
Of my Savior crucified.
_
Let me share with you His pain,
Who for all our sins was slain,
Who for me in torments died.
_
Mix’d with yours let my tears be,
Mourning Him Who mourned for me,
All the days that I may live.
_
By the Cross with you to stay,
There with you to weep and pray,
Is all I ask of you to give.
_
Virgin of all virgins blest!
Listen to my fond request:
Let me share that grief of yours.
_
Let me, to my latest breath,
In my body bear the death
Of that dying Son of yours.
_
Wounded with His every wound,
Steep my soul till it has swooned
In His very Blood away.
_
Be to me, O Virgin, nigh,
Lest in flames I burn and die,
In this awful judgment day.
_
Christ, when You shall call me hence,
Be Your Mother my defense,
Be Your Cross my victory.
_
While my body here decays,
May my soul Your goodness praise,
Safe in heaven eternally.
Amen.

[Evangelium]
Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 19:25-27
At that time, there were standing by the Cross of Jesus His Mother and His Mother’s sister, Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus, therefore, saw His Mother and the disciple standing by, whom He loved, He said to His Mother, Woman, behold your son. Then He said to the disciples, Behold your Mother. And from that hour the disciple took her into his home.

[Offertorium]
!Jer 18:20
Be mindful, O Virgin Mother of god, when you stand in the sight of the Lord, to speak good things for us, and to turn away His anger from us.

[Secreta]
O Lord Jesus Christ, we offer You prayers and sacrificial gifts, humbly beseeching You that, as we prayerfully recall the piercing of the most sweet soul of Your blessed Mother Mary, so through the merits of Your death and the manifold intercession of her and her holy friends at the foot of the Cross, we may have our reward with the blessed.
