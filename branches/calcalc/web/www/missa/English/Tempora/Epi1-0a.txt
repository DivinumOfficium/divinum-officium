Lesson
!Rom 12:1-5
Brethren: I exhort you, by the mercy of God, to present your bodies as a sacrifice, living, holy, pleasing to God - your spiritual service. And be not conformed to this world, but be transformed in the newness of your mind, that you may discern what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God. By the grace that has been given to me, I say to each one among you: let no one rate himself more than he ought, but let him rate himself according to moderation, and according as God has apportioned to each one the measure of faith. For just as in one body we have many members, yet all the members have not the same function, so we, the many, are one body in Christ, but severally members, one of another, in Christ Jesus, our Lord.

[Evangelium]
Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to
!Luke 2:42-52
When Jesus was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the~
custom of the feast. And after they had fulfilled the days, when there were~
returning, the Boy Jesus remained in Jerusalem, and His parents did not know it.~
But thinking that He was in the caravan, they had come a day’s journey before it~
occurred to them to look for Him among their relatives and acquaintances. And~
not finding Him, they returned to Jerusalem in search of Him. And it came to~
pass after three days, that they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst~
of the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. And all who were~
listening to Him were amazed at His understanding and His answers. And when they~
saw Him, they were astonished. And His Mother said to Him, Son, why have You~
done so to us? Behold, in sorrow Your father and I have been seeking You. And~
He said to them, How is it that you sought Me? Did you not know that I must be~
about My Father’s business? And they did not understand the word that He spoke~
to them. And He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was subject to~
them; and His Mother kept all these things carefully in her heart. And Jesus~
advanced in wisdom and age and grace before God and men.
