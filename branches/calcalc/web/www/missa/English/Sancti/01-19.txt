Lesson from the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews
!Heb 10:32-38
Brethren: Call to mind the days gone by, in which, after you had been enlightened, you endured a great conflict of sufferings; partly by being made a public spectacle through reproaches and tribulations, and partly by making common cause with those who fared thus. For you both have had compassion on those in prison and have joyfully accepted the plundering of your own goods, knowing that you have a better possession and a lasting one. Do not, therefore, lose your confidence, which has a great reward. For you have need of patience that, doing the will of God, you may receive the promise: For yet a very little while, and He Who is to come, will come, and will not delay. Now my just one lives by faith.

[Graduale]

Alleluia, alleluia.
!Ps 67:36

[Tractus]
!Ps 125:5-6
Those that sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
V. Although they go forth weeping, carrying, the seed to be sown.
V. They shall come back rejoicing, carrying their sheaves.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 24:3-13
At that time, as Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came~
to Him privately, saying: Tell us, when are these things to happen, and what~
will be the sign of Your coming and of the end of the world? And in answer Jesus~
said to them, Take care that no one leads you astray. For many will come in My~
name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and they will lead many astray. For you shall~
hear of wars and rumors of wars. Take care that you do not be alarmed, for these~
things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against~
nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be pestilences and famines~
and earthquakes in various places. But all these things are the beginnings of~
sorrows. Then they will deliver you up to tribulation, and will put you to death;~
and you will be hated by all nations for My name’s sake. And then many will fall~
away, and will betray one another, and will hate one another. And many false~
prophets will arise, and will lead many astray. And because iniquity will abound,~
the charity of the many will grow cold. But whoever perseveres to the end, he~
shall be saved.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 123:7
We were rescued like a bird from the fowlers’ snare; broken was the snare, and~
we were freed.
