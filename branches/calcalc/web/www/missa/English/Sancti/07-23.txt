[Lectio]
Lesson from the first letter of St Peter the Apostle
!1 Pet. 5:1-11
Beloved: I exhort the presbyters among you - I, your fellow-presbyter and witness of the sufferings of Christ, the partaker also of the glory that is to be revealed in time to come - tend the flock of God which is among you, governing not under constraint, but willingly, according to God; nor yet for the sake of base gain, but eagerly; nor yet as lording it over your charges, but becoming from the heart a pattern to the flock. And when the Prince of the shepherds appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory. Likewise, you who are younger, be subject to the presbyters. And all of you practice humility toward one another; for, God, resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble. Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in the time of visitation; cast all your anxiety upon Him, because He cares for you. Be sober, be watchful! For your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, goes about seeking someone to devour. Resist him, steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same suffering befalls your brethren all over the world. But the God of all grace, Who has called us unto His eternal glory in Christ Jesus, will Himself, after we have suffered a little while, perfect, strengthen and establish us. To Him is the dominion forever and ever. Amen.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 22:24-30
At that time, there arose a dispute among the disciples, which of them was~
reputed to be the greatest. But Jesus said to them, The kings of the Gentiles~
lord it over them, and they who exercise authority over them are called~
Benefactors. But not so with you. On the contrary, let him who is greatest~
among you become as the youngest, and him who is the chief as the servant. For~
which is the greater, he who reclines at table, or he who serves? Is it not he~
who reclines? But I am in your midst as he who serves. But you are they who have~
continued with Me in My trials. And I appoint to you a kingdom, even as My~
Father has appointed to Me, that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom;~
and you shall sit upon thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 88:25
My faithfulness and My kindness shall be with him, and through My name shall his~
horn be exalted.
