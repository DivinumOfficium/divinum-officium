Lesson from the first letter of St Paul the Apostle to Timothy
!1 Tim 3:1-7
1 A faithful saying: if a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.
2 It behoveth therefore a bishop to be blameless, the husband of one wife, sober, prudent, of good behaviour, chaste, given to hospitality, a teacher,
3 Not given to wine, no striker, but modest, not quarrelsome, not covetous, but
4 One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all chastity.
5 But if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?
6 Not a neophyte: lest being puffed up with pride, he fall into the judgment of the devil.
7 Moreover he must have a good testimony of them who are without: lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.

[Responsory1]
R. Well done, thou good and faithful servant, thou hast been faithful over a few things. I will make thee ruler over many things
* Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord. Alleluia
V. Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents; behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.
R. Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord. Alleluia

[Lectio2]
From the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to Titus
!Titus 1:7-11
7 For a bishop must be without crime, as the steward of God: not proud, not subject to anger, not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre:
8 But given to hospitality, gentle, sober, just, holy, continent:
9 Embracing that faithful word which is according to doctrine, that he may be able to exhort in sound doctrine, and to convince the gainsayers.
10 For there are also many disobedient, vain talkers, and seducers: especially they who are of the circumcision:
11 Who must be reproved, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.

[Responsory2]
R. Behold an high priest, who in his days pleased God
* Therefore the Lord assured him by an oath that He would multiply his seed among His people. Alleluia
V. He hath made him a blessing unto all nations, and hath established His covenant upon his head.
R. Therefore the Lord assured him by an oath that He would multiply his seed among His people Alleluia

[Lectio3]
!Titus 2:1-8
1 But speak thou the things that become sound doctrine:
2 That the aged men be sober, chaste, prudent, sound in faith, in love, in patience.
3 The aged women, in like manner, in holy attire, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teaching well:
4 That they may teach the young women to be wise, to love their husbands, to love their children,
5 To be discreet, chaste, sober, having a care of the house, gentle, obedient to their husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.
6 Young men, in like manner, exhort that they be sober.
7 In all things show thyself an example of good works, in doctrine, in integrity, in gravity,
8 The sound word that can not be blamed: that he, who is on the contrary part, may be afraid, having no evil to say of us.

[Responsory3]
R. The Lord hath sworn and will not repent
* Thou art a Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedek. Alleluia
V. The Lord said unto my Lord Sit Thou at My right hand.
R.* Thou art a Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedek. Alleluia
&Gloria
R. Thou art a Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedek. Alleluia

From the Sermons of St Maximus, Bishop [of Turin.]
!Homilia 59, being the 2nd on St Eusebius of Vercelli.
It is idle to strive to add anything to the praise of our holy and most blessed Father N. whose Feast is this day kept. The beauty of his life oughtnot to be the subject of panegyrics, so much as the object of imitation. The Scripture saith "A wise son is the glory of his father," truly then will he be honoured by such as, by doing after his en sample,show themselves to be his children for~
in Christ Jesus hath he begotten us through the Gospel.(1 Cor. iv. 15.)

[Responsory4]
R. I have found David My servant, with My holy oil have I anointed him
* For My hand shall help him. Alleluia
V. The enemy shall prevail nothing against him, nor the son of wickedness afflict him.
R. For My hand shall help him. Alleluia

[Lectio5]
Whatsoever, therefore, of virtue and grace there may be in this holy people, all the bright streams thereof do flow from him, as from a most clear fountain. By his manly chastity, by his sternly noble temperance, by the graceful courtesy which marked him, he drew all men's love to God and by his eminent ministry in his Bishoprick he hath left behind him in his disciples, many heirs of his priesthood.

[Responsory5]
R. I have laid help upon one that is mighty, and have exalted one chosen out of My people
* For My hand shall help him. Alleluia
V. I have found David My servant, with My holy oil have I anointed him.
R. For My hand shall help him. Alleluia

[Lectio6]
It is very meet and right that upon this day, which is made a joyful day for us because it is the day whereon our blessed Father N.,  passed away to heaven, I say it is very meet and right that on this day we should sing that verse of the Psalms "The righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance." (cxi. 7.) His memory is rightly honoured among men who is at this present making glad among Angels. The word of God saith "Judge none blessed before his death," (Ecclus. xi. 30,) as though it were said, "Judge him blessed when life is ended, praise him when he is made perfect." For there are two main reasons why it is better to praise a dead man than a living, since, if thou call him holy and worthy after his death, thou dost it when neither canst thou be corrupted by being a flatterer, nor he by being nattered.

[Responsory6]
R. This is he which wrought great wonders before God, and the whole earth is full of his teaching
* May he pray for all people, that their sins may be forgiven unto them Alleluia
V. This is he which loved not his life in this world, and hath attained unto the kingdom of heaven.
R. May he pray for all people, that their sins may be forgiven unto them Alleluia
&Gloria
R. May he pray for all people, that their sins may be forgiven unto them Alleluia

[Lectio7]
From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 25:14-23
At that time Jesus spake unto His disciples this parable A man, travelling into a far country, called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods. And so on.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory [the Great.]
!9th on the Gospels.
Dearly beloved brethren, this Lesson from the Holy Gospel moveth us to take good heed lest we, who are seen in this world to have received more than others, should thereby bring ourselves into greater condemnation from the Maker of this world. To whom much is given, of the same is much required. Therefore, let him that receiveth much, strive to be all the more lowly, and all the more ready to do God service, for his very gifts' sake, knowing that he will be obliged to give account thereof. Behold, a man, travelling into a far country, calleth his own servants, and delivereth unto them talents, to the end that they may trade therewith. After a long time, the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them, and to them that have done well He rendereth a reward of their labours, but that servant which was careless of his master's work He condemneth.

[Responsory7]
R. The Lord loved him and beautified him He clothed him with a robe of glory
* And crowned him at the gates of Paradise. Alleluia
V. The Lord hath put on him the breast-plate of faith, and hath adorned him.
R. And crowned him at the gates of Paradise. Alleluia

[Lectio8]
What other, then, is that man travelling into a far country but our Redeemer, Who is gone up from us into heaven in that Flesh Which He had taken into Himself? For the earth is the home of the Flesh, Which travelleth into a far country when our Redeemer giveth It a place in heaven. But that man travelling into a far country delivered unto his servants his goods and so doth our Redeemer give spiritual gifts unto His faithful people. "And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one." There are five bodily senses that is, sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch. By the five talents therefore are signified the five senses, that is, outward knowledge. By the two, wit and work. And by the figure of the one talent, understanding, which is alone.

[Responsory8]
R. Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning
* And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding. Alleluia
V. Watch therefore, for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.
R. And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding. Alleluia
&Gloria
R. And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding. Alleluia

[Lectio9]
And so he that had received five talents, gained other five talents for some there be who, while yet they are not able to go on unto things inward and mystic, do yet so desire our Fatherland which is above, that they teach well all whom they can, and of those very outward things which they have received make gain double. These are they which keep themselves clean from the unruly motions of the flesh, and from the lust of the world, and from the delight of things which are seen, and, by their preaching, keep other men also clean from all these things. And some there are who receive, as their two talents, the power to think and the power to work. These are they which inwardly understand dark things, and outwardly work wonders. And these, since they preach unto others, both through their understanding and their' works, gain, as it were, double, for the talents which they have received.
