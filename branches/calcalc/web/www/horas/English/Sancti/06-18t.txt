[Oratio]
O Almighty God, grant, we beseech thee, that we who do keep the Birthday of~
thine Holy Martyrs Mark and Marcellian, may through their prayers be delivered~
from all evils which do presently hang over us.
$Per Dominum

[Lectio93]
Mark and Marcellian were two brothers, Romans, who were arrested by Duke Fabian~
for believing in Christ, and fastened to a beam, to which their feet were~
nailed. The Judge said to them Wretched creatures, do think for a moment, and~
free yourselves from such suffering. But they answered him We have never~
enjoyed any dinner so much as we do what we are now undergoing here for Jesus~
Christ's sake. We have got ourselves a little fast to His love now. Would that~
He would let us suffer this as long as we are clad in this corruptible body.~
Still suffering, they for a day and a night sang the praises of God continually,~
and in the end were thrust through with darts, and so attained the glory of~
Martyrdom. Their bodies are buried upon the Way to Ardea.
