[Lectio93]
Remigius, Archbishop of Rheims, flourished in the time of Chlodwig, King of the~
Franks, whom he baptised, and was the first who, by his preaching and miracles,~
brought the Franks to believe in the Lord Christ. At his prayers, a dead maiden~
was raised to life. He expounded many books of the Holy Scriptures. He~
ministered to the Church of Rheims with the utmost acceptance for above three~
score and ten years, and the holiness of his life and death were witnessed by~
many signs and wonders which befell afterwards.
