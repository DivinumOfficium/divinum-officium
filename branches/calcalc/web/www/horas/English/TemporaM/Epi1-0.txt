!1 Cor 1:4-9
4 I give thanks to my God always for you, for the grace of God that is given you~
in Christ Jesus,
5 That in all things you are made rich in him, in all utterance, and in all~
knowledge;
6 As the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you,
7 So that nothing is wanting to you in any grace, waiting for the manifestation~
of our Lord Jesus Christ.
8 Who also will confirm you unto the end without crime, in the day of the coming~
of our Lord Jesus Christ.
9 God is faithful: by whom you are called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus~
Christ our Lord.

!1 Cor 1:10-13
10 Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you~
all speak the same thing, and that there be no schisms among you; but that you~
be perfect in the same mind, and in the same judgment.
11 For it hath been signified unto me, my brethren, of you, by them that are of~
the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.
12 Now this I say, that every one of you saith: I indeed am of Paul; and I am of~
Apollo; and I am of Cephas; and I of Christ.
13 Is Christ divided? Was Paul then crucified for you? or were you baptized in~
the name of Paul?

[Lectio4]
From the Sermons of Pope St Leo (the Great.)
!5th on the the Twelfth day
This meet and right, dearly beloved brethren, yea, it is our bounden duty and~
godly service, to rejoice with full hearts upon those days which more especially~
set forth before us the workings of God's mercy; and to have in honourable~
memory those things that were done for our salvation. Hereto are we called by~
the seasons of the year which continually return, and notably by this present,~
which, after but a short time hath passed since that day whereon the Coeternal~
Son of God was born of a Virgin, bringeth now the Feast of the Epiphany,~
hallowed by the Manifestation of the Lord.

[Responsory4]
R. Ego autem medicus sum et pauper:
* Dominus sollicitus est mei.
V. Laborem manuum manuum tuarum quia manducabis, beatus es, bene tibi erit.
R. Dominus sollicitus est mei.

[Lectio5]
In this said Manifestation the good Providence of God hath appointed a strong~
bulwark to our faith. For now, while in solemn worship we call to mind how the~
childhood of the Saviour was adored in its first infancy, we receive from the~
original Scriptures the doctrine that Christ was born with the very nature of~
man. For this is that which maketh of sinners saints, even to believe that in~
one and the same our Lord Jesus Christ there is very Godhead and very Manhood~
very Godhead, as touching Which, He, being in the form of God, is equal to the~
Father from everlasting to everlasting and very Manhood, wherein He, taking upon~
Him the form of a servant, hath in these latter days been born Man.

[Responsory5]
R. Vulpes foveas habent, volucres caeli nidos,
* Filius autem hominis non habet, ubi caput reclinet.
V. Pauper sum ego, et in laboribus a juventüte mea.
R. Filius autem hominis non habet, ubi caput reclinet.

[Lectio6]
For the strengthening of this our faith, which we profess in the face of every~
false doctrine, the mercy of God hath made it to come to pass that one of those~
peoples who dwell in the uttermost parts of the East, and excel in the skill of~
reading the stars, should see the sign of the birth of that Child Who was to~
reign over all Israel. There appeared to the eyes of wise men a new star of such~
passing beauty, as wrought in the minds of all that saw it the persuasion that~
the event, which is announced, was of an importance not to be neglected.

[Responsory6]
R. Cum in forma Dei esset, semetipsum exinanivit
* Formam servi accipiens
V. Humiliavit semetipsum, factus obediens usque ad mortem.
R. Formam servi accipiens
&Gloria
R. Formam servi accipiens

[Lectio7]
From the holy Gospel according to Luke.
!Luke 2:42-52
And when Jesus was twelve years old, they going up into Jerusalem, according to~
the custom of the feast, And having fulfilled the days, when they returned, the~
child Jesus remained in Jerusalem. And so on.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!Bk. ii. on Luke ii.
We read that when He was twelve years old the Lord began to dispute. The number~
of His years was the same as the number of the Apostles whom He afterwards sent~
forth to preach the Faith. He Who, as touching His Manhood, was filled with~
wisdom and grace from God, was not careless of the parents of the same Manhood,~
and, after three days, was pleased to be found in the Temple thereby~
foreshadowing that, after the three days of His victorious Passion, He That had~
been reckoned with the dead, would present Himself, living, to our faith, in His~
heavenly Kingship and Divine Majesty.

[Responsory7]
R. Vere tu es Rex absconditus
* Deus Israel Salvator.
V. Tu doces hominem scientiam.
R. Deus Israel Salvator.

[Lectio8]
How is it that ye sought Me? Christ hath two Generations; one from His Father,~
another from His Mother. That from His Father is His Eternal Generation as God~
the Son; that from His Mother is that whereby He came to work for us and~
minister to us. Those acts, therefore, of His, which are above nature, beyond~
His age, and different to His custom, proceeded not from the strength of His~
Manhood, but from the power of His Godhead. On another occasion His Mother~
moveth Him to work a miracle; here He answereth her, because she treateth that~
which was of the Godhead, as though it had been of the Manhood. On this occasion~
it is said that He was twelve years old, but on the other He had already~
disciples. His mother had seen His wonders on the earlier occasion, and had~
learnt from her Son to call on the mightier nature for a work of power.

[Responsory8]
R. Sicut per inobedientiam unius hominis peccatores constitüti sunt multi
* Ita et per unius obedientiam justi constientur multi.
V. Venit Nazareth et erat sübditus illis
R. Ita et per unius obedientiam justi constientur multi.
&Gloria
R. Ita et per unius obedientiam justi constientur multi.

[Lectio9]
And He came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them. No wonder that the great~
Teacher should practise. And shall we marvel how He Who was subject to His~
Mother, was about His Father's business? His subjection to His Mother proceeded,~
not from weakness, but from dutiful affection. Nevertheless, the false serpent~
lifteth its head from its cruel lair, and spitteth poison from its venomous~
breast. The heretics say that, as the Son was sent by the Father, therefore the~
Father is greater than the Son, and, if the Father be greater than the Son,~
there is that, than which the Son is less; yea, that He Who is sent, hath of~
necessity, need of some strengthening from outside Himself. He was subject to~
His Mother? Was He less than she? God forbid!

[Responsory9]
R. Hic et dies preclarus in quo salvator mundi apparuit, quem Prophetae~
predixerunt, Angeli annuntiaverunt.
* Cuius stellam Magi videntes gavisi sunt, et munera ei obtulerunt
V. Dies sanctificatus illuxit nobis: venite gentes et adorate Dominum.
R. Cuius stellam Magi videntes gavisi sunt, et munera ei obtulerunt
&Gloria
R. Cuius stellam Magi videntes gavisi sunt, et munera ei obtulerunt

[LectioE]
v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 2:42-52
2:42 And when he was twelve years old, they going up into Jerusalem, according to the custom of the feast,
2:43 And having fulfilled the days, when they returned, the child Jesus remained in Jerusalem; and his parents knew it not.
2:44 And thinking that he was in the company, they came a day's journey, and sought him among their kinsfolks and acquaintance.
2:45 And not finding him, they returned into Jerusalem, seeking him.
2:46 And it came to pass, that, after three days, they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, hearing them, and asking them questions.
2:47 And all that heard him were astonished at his wisdom and his answers.
2:48 And seeing him, they wondered. And his mother said to him: Son, why hast thou done so to us? behold thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.
2:49 And he said to them: How is it that you sought me? did you not know, that I must be about my father's business?
2:50 And they understood not the word that he spoke unto them.
2:51 And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them. And his mother kept all these words in her heart.
2:52 And Jesus advanced in wisdom, and age, and grace with God and men.
