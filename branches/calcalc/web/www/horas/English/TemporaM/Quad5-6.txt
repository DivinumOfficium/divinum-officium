From the holy Gospel according to John
!John 12:10-36
In that time the chief priests thought to kill Lazarus also: Because many of the~
Jews, by reason of him, went away, and believed in Jesus. And so on.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo. )
!5 oth Tract on John.
When they saw Lazarus who had been raised from the dead, and knew that the~
miracle which the Lord had worked was so great, spread about by so many~
witnesses, and so plain and manifest that it could neither be concealed nor~
denied, they invented an expedient; and see here what it was But the chief~
Priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death. What stupidity of~
thought, what blindness of cruelty is here! If the Lord Christ had raised up~
again a man who had died a natural death, could He not also raise up one that~
had died by violence? Would killing Lazarus paralyse the Lord? But if ye~
consider that there is a difference between a man dead of disease, and a man~
killed, behold, the Lord hath raised up both for He first raised up Lazarus,~
who had died a natural death, and then Himself, after a violent one.

On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that~
Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, took branches of palm-trees, and went forth to~
meet Him, and cried Hosanna! Blessed is the King of Israel That cometh in the~
Name of the Lord! Palmbranches are glorious boughs which tell of victory; yea,~
the Lord was now ready by His Own Death to trample down death, and to carry the~
victorious banner of His Cross in triumph over the devil, the prince of death.~
The cry with which He was greeted, namely Hosanna, hath not, as we are assured~
by some who are acquainted with the Hebrew language, any meaning in particular,~
but is a shout after the manner of interjections, as they are called, just as in~
Latin when we lament we say Heu, or when we are pleased, Vah. * is, as He Who is~
Lord of our intellect, a Ruler Whose power shall never wane, and Who openeth a~
Kingdom in heaven to all such as centre in Him their faith, their hope, and~
their love.

These were the shouts of applause with which the crowd greeted Him, Hosanna!~
Blessed is the King of Israel That cometh in the Name of the Lord! What inward~
torture must the jealousy of the Jewish leaders have caused them, when they~
heard that great multitude hailing Christ as their King! But, for the Lord, what~
was it to be King of Israel? To the Eternal King what mattered it to become a~
King of men? And Christ is not King of Israel in the sense of monarchs who exact~
tribute, or arm hosts with steel to conquer enemies that are seen. But King of~
Israel He sitting upon the foal of an ass, as had been foretold in the prophecy~
of Zacharias, and the multitude came forth to meet Him carrying branches of~
palmtrees.

O Lord, we beseech thee that thy people, since they are hallowed as thine Own,~

mercifully grant, that we may both follow the example of His patience, and also~
be made partakers of His resurrection.

v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 12:10-36
12:10 But the chief priests thought to kill Lazarus also:
12:11 Because many of the Jews, by reason of him, went away, and believed in Jesus.
12:12 And on the next day, a great multitude that was to come to the festival day, when they had heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
12:13 Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried: Hosanna, blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, the king of Israel.
12:14 And Jesus found a young ass, and sat upon it, as it is written:
12:15 Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy king cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.
12:16 These things his disciples did not know at the first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things to him.
12:17 The multitude therefore gave testimony, which was with him, when he called Lazarus out of the grave, and raised him from the dead.
12:18 For which reason also the people came to meet him, because they heard that he had done this miracle.
12:19 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves: Do you see that we prevail nothing? behold, the whole world is gone after him.
12:20 Now there were certain Gentiles among them, who came up to adore on the festival day.
12:21 These therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying: Sir, we would see Jesus.
12:22 Philip cometh, and telleth Andrew. Again Andrew and Philip told Jesus.
12:23 But Jesus answered them, saying: The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.
12:24 Amen, amen I say to you, unless the grain of wheat falling into the ground die,
12:25 Itself remaineth alone. But if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world, keepeth it unto life eternal.
12:26 If any man minister to me, let him follow me; and where I am, there also shall my minister be. If any man minister to me, him will my Father honour.
12:27 Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause I came unto this hour.
12:28 Father, glorify thy name. A voice therefore came from heaven: I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.
12:29 The multitude therefore that stood and heard, said that it thundered. Others said: An angel spoke to him.
12:30 Jesus answered, and said: This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.
12:31 Now is the judgment of the world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
12:32 And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all things to myself.
12:33 (Now this he said, signifying what death he should die.)
12:34 The multitude answered him: We have heard out of the law, that Christ abideth for ever; and how sayest thou: The Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?
12:35 Jesus therefore said to them: Yet a little while, the light is among you. Walk whilst you have the light, that the darkness overtake you not. And he that walketh in darkness, knoweth not whither he goeth.
12:36 Whilst you have the light, believe in the light, that you may be the children of light. These things Jesus spoke; and he went away, and hid himself from them.
