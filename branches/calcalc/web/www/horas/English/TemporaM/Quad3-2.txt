From the holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 18:15-22
In that time Jesus said to his disciples: But if thy brother shall offend~
against thee, go, and rebuke him between thee and him alone. And so on.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!16th Sermon on the Words of the Lord, vol. x.
Why tell him his fault? Because he hath made thee smart by trespassing against~
thee? God forbid. If thou tell him his fault because thou lovest thyself, thou dost nothing. But if~
thou tell it him because thou lovest him, then dost thou do exceeding well. Hear~
now, in the words of the Gospel itself, for love of whom, thou oughtest to do it,~
of thyself, or of him. The Lord saith If he shall hear thee, thou hast gained~
thy brother. Therefore it behoveth thee to do it for his sake, that thou mayest~
gain him; since, if thou so do, haply thou mayest gain him; whereas, if thou do~
it not, he may haply perish. Why then are there so many who reckon lightly of a~
trespass against their brother, and say I have done no great offence, for I~
have trespassed only against my fellow man? Deem it not light; thou hast~
trespassed, though it be against thy fellow man.

[Responsory1]
R. They told Jacob, saying thy son Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor~
over all the land of Egypt; and, when he heard it, his spirit revived, and he~
said
* It is enough; I will go, and see him before I die.
V. And when Jacob heard that his son yet lived, he was as one that awakeneth~
from a deep sleep, and said
R. It is enough; I will go, and see him before I die.

[Lectio2]
Wouldest thou know that thy trespass against thy brother hath destroyed thee? If~
he against whom thou hast trespassed tell thee thy fault between himself and~
thee alone, and thou hear him, he hath gained thee. Gained thee! And what~
signify those words, if it be not that thou, if thou be not gained, shalt~
perish? For if thou shouldest not otherwise perish, in what sense can he be said~
to gain thee? Therefore let no man deem it a light thing when he trespasseth~
against his brother. For the Apostle Paul saith in a certain place When ye~
sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against~
Christ. (1 Cor. viii. 12.) We are all members of Christ. How dost thou not~
trespass against Christ, which trespassest against one of His members?

[Lectio3]
Let no man therefore say I have not trespassed against God, but only against~
my brother; that is, I have trespassed against my fellowman; and so the sin is~
light, if any at all. And perchance thou wilt argue that it is light, because it~
is quickly mended; thou hast trespassed against thy brother, but thou canst make~
satisfaction, and be right again; thou hast done the deadly thing quickly, and~
quickly canst thou find a remedy. O my brethren, which of us can hope for the~
kingdom of heaven, when we remember that the Gospel saith Whosoever shall say~
to his brother Thou fool shall be in danger of hell fire? (Matth. v. 22.)~
It is a thought full of dread; but, lo! the remedy  If thou bring thy gift to~
the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee, leave~
there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy~
brother, and then come and offer thy gift. God is not wroth that thou tarry or~
ever thou offer thy gift; for God seeketh thyself more than thy gift.

v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 18:15-22
18:15 But if thy brother shall offend against thee, go, and rebuke him between thee and him alone. If he shall hear thee, thou shalt gain thy brother.
18:16 And if he will not hear thee, take with thee one or two more: that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may stand.
18:17 And if he will not hear them: tell the church. And if he will not hear the church, let him be to thee as the heathen and publican.
18:18 Amen I say to you, whatsoever you shall bind upon earth, shall be bound also in heaven; and whatsoever you shall loose upon earth, shall be loosed also in heaven.
18:19 Again I say to you, that if two of you shall consent upon earth, concerning any thing whatsoever they shall ask, it shall be done to them by my Father who is in heaven.
18:20 For where there are two or three gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.
18:21 Then came Peter unto him and said: Lord, how often shall my brother offend against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?
18:22 Jesus saith to him: I say not to thee, till seven times; but till seventy times seven times.
