Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 4:38
At that time Jesus arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house.~
And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever. And so on.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop of Milan
!Bk. iv. on Luke iv.
Behold here how long-suffering is the Lord our Redeemer Neither moved to anger~
against them, nor sickened at their guilt, nor outraged by their attacks, did He~
leave the Jews' country. Nay, forgetting their iniquity, and mindful only of His~
mercy, He strove to soften their hard and unbelieving hearts, sometimes by His~
teaching, and sometimes by freeing some of them, and sometimes by healing them.~
St Luke doth well to tell us first of the man who was delivered from an unclean~
spirit, and then of the healing of a woman. The Lord indeed came to heal both~
sexes, but that must be healed first which was created first, and then must not~
she be passed by whose first sin arose rather from fickleness of heart than from~
depraved will.

[Responsory1]
R. They were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak, as the Holy~
Ghost gave them utterance
* And the multitude came together, saying: Alleluia.
V. The Apostle spake in divers tongues the wonderful works of God.
R. And the multitude came together, saying: Alleluia.

[Lectio2]
That the Lord began to heal on the Sabbath-day showeth in a figure how that the~
new creation beginneth where the old creation ended. It showeth, moreover, that~
the Son of God, Who is come not to destroy the law but to fulfil the law,~
~(Matth. v. 17,) is not under the law, but above the law. Neither was it by the~
law, but by the Word, that the world was created, as it is written " By the~
Word of the Lord were the heavens made." (Ps. xxxii. 6.) The law, then, is not~
destroyed, but fulfilled, in the Redemption of fallen man. Whence also the~
Apostle saith " Put off, concerning the former conversation, the old man,~
which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts and be renewed in the spirit~
of your mind and put on the new man, which after God is created in~
righteousness and true holiness." (Eph. iv. 22.)

[Responsory2]
R. Henceforth I call you not servants, but I have called you My friends~
because ye have known all things, whatsoever I have done among you. Alleluia.
* Receive ye the Holy Ghost, Who is your Comforter within you the Same is He~
Whom the Father will send unto you. Alleluia.
V. Ye are My friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.
R. Receive ye the Holy Ghost Who is your Comforter within you the Same is He~
Whom the Father will send unto you. Alleluia.
&Gloria
R. Receive ye the Holy Ghost Who is your Comforter within you the Same is He~
Whom the Father will send unto you. Alleluia.

[Lectio3]
It was well that He began to heal on the Sabbath, that He might show Himself to~
be the Creator, weaving in one with another of His works, and continuing that~
which He had already begun, even as a workman, being to repair an house,~
beginneth not to take down that which is old from the foundations, but from the~
roof. Thus doth the Lord begin to lay to His hand again, in that place whence~
last He hath lifted it then He beginneth with things lesser, that He may go on~
to things greater. Even men are able to deliver other men from evil spirits,~
albeit with the word of God to command the dead to rise again is for God's~
power alone.Perchance, also, this woman, the mother-in-law of Simon and Andrew,~
was a type of our nature, stricken down with the great fever of sin, and burning~
with unlawful lusts after divers objects. Nor would I say that the passion which~
rageth in the mind is a lesser fire than that fever which burneth the body.~
Covetousness, and lust, and uncleanness, and vain desires, and strivings, and~
anger these be our fevers.
