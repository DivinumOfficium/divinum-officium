(Canticum Isaiae * Isa 26:1-12)
26:1 In that day shall this canticle be sung the land of Juda. Sion the city of our strength a saviour, a wall and a bulwark shall be set therein.
26:2 Open ye the gates, and let the just nation, that keepeth the truth, enter in.
26:3 The old error is passed away: thou wilt keep peace: peace, because we have hoped in thee.
26:4 You have hoped in the Lord for evermore, in the Lord God mighty for ever.
26:5 For he shall bring down them that dwell on high, the high city he shall lay low. He shall bring it down even to the ground, he shall pull it down even to the dust.
26:6 The foot shall tread it down, the feet of the poor, the steps of the needy.
26:7 The way of the just is right, the path of the just is right to walk in.
26:8 And in the way of thy judgments, O Lord, we have patiently waited for thee: thy name, and thy remembrance are the desire of the soul.
26:9 My soul hath desired thee in the night: yea, and with my spirit within me in the morning early I will watch to thee. When thou shalt do thy judgments on the earth, the inhabitants of the world shall learn justice.
26:10 Let us have pity on the wicked, but he will not learn justice: in the land of the saints he hath done wicked things, and he shall not see the glory of the Lord.
26:11 Lord, let thy hand be exalted, and let them not see: let the envious people see, and be confounded: and let fire devour thy enemies.
26:12 Lord, thou wilt give us peace: for thou hast wrought all our works for us.
