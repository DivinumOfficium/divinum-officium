74:1 (Unto the end, corrupt not, a psalm of a canticle for Asaph.)
74:2 We will praise thee, O God: we will praise, and we will call upon thy name. We will relate thy wondrous works:
74:3 When I shall take a time, I will judge justices.
74:4 The earth is melted, and all that dwell therein: I have established the pillars thereof.
74:5 I said to the wicked: Do not act wickedly: and to the sinners: Lift not up the horn.
74:6 Lift not up your horn on high: speak not iniquity against God.
74:7 For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the desert hills:
74:8 For God is the judge. One he putteth down, and another he lifteth up:
74:9 For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup of strong wine full of mixture. And he hath poured it out from this to that: but the dregs thereof are not emptied: all the sinners of the earth shall drink.
74:10 But I will declare for ever: I will sing to the God of Jacob.
74:11 And I will break all the horns of sinners: but the horns of the just shall be exalted.
