71:1 (A psalm on Solomon.)
71:2 Give to the king thy judgment, O God, and to the king's son thy justice: To judge thy people with justice, and thy poor with judgment.
71:3 Let the mountains receive peace for the people: and the hills justice.
71:4 He shall judge the poor of the people, and he shall save the children of the poor: and he shall humble the oppressor.
71:5 And he shall continue with the sun and before the moon, throughout all generations.
71:6 He shall come down like rain upon the fleece; and as showers falling gently upon the earth.
71:7 In his days shall justice spring up, and abundance of peace, till the moon be taken away.
71:8 And he shall rule from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.
71:9 Before him the Ethiopians shall fall down: and his enemies shall lick the ground.
71:10 The kings of Tharsis and the islands shall offer presents: the kings of the Arabians and of Saba shall bring gifts:
71:11 And all kings of the earth shall adore him: all nations shall serve him.
71:12 For he shall deliver the poor from the mighty: and the needy that had no helper.
71:13 He shall spare the poor and needy: and he shall save the souls of the poor.
71:14 He shall redeem their souls from usuries and iniquity: and their names shall be honourable in his sight.
71:15 And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Arabia, for him they shall always adore: they shall bless him all the day.
71:16 And there shall be a firmament on the earth on the tops of mountains, above Libanus shall the fruit thereof be exalted: and they of the city shall flourish like the grass of the earth.
71:17 Let his name be blessed for evermore: his name continueth before the sun. And in him shall all the tribes of the earth be blessed: all nations shall magnify him.
71:18 Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who alone doth wonderful things.
71:19 And blessed be the name of his majesty for ever: and the whole earth shall be filled with his majesty. So be it. So be it.
71:20 The praises of David, the son of Jesse, are ended.
