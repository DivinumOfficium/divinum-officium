From the Book against Jovinian written by St Jerome, Priest at Bethlehem.
!Bk. 1
The Apostle John was one of the disciples of the Lord. There is a tradition~
that he was the youngest of the Apostles. He was a virgin when the Faith of~
Christ found him, and he hath remained a virgin for ever. This is why he was "~
the disciple whom Jesus loved" more than any of the others, and why he "leaned~
on Jesus' Breast." When Peter, who had been married, wished to ask the Lord who~
it was that was about to betray Him, he dared not ask for himself, but beckoned~
to John, that he should ask it. (John xiii. 23, 24.) After the Resurrection,~
when " Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that the Lord was risen, Peter~
and John ran both together to the sepulchre, but John did outrun Peter." (xx.~
2-4.) Later on, when the Apostles were on the Sea of Galilee, in a ship, fishing,~
"Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus," till~
virgin knew Virgin, and " that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter It~
is the Lord."

[Lectio5]
John was both an Apostle, and an Evangelist, and a Prophet. He was an Apostle,~
in that he wrote to the Churches, as their Teacher. He was an Evangelist, in~
that he wrote one of the Gospels, the like whereto was not done by any other of~
the twelve Apostles, save Matthew. He was a Prophet, in that when he was in the~
isle of Patmos, whither he had been banished by Domitian on account of his~
uplifting of his testimony for the Lord, he saw there that Apocalypse which~
containeth such unfathomable mysteries concerning " things which shall be~
hereafter." (Apoc. i. 19.) Tertullian also saith that when he was at Rome, he~
was put into a vessel of boiling oil, but that he came out cleaner and healthier~
than he went in.

[Lectio6]
There is a great difference between his Gospel and the three others. Matthew~
beginneth to write as of a man " The Book of the Generation of Jesus Christ,~
the Son of David, the son of Abraham." Luke's first words of history relate to~
the priesthood of Zacharias Mark commenceth with the prophecies of Malachi and~
Isaiah. The first hath the face of a man, with an human genealogy the second~
hath the face of a calf, being a victim offered by priests the third hath the~
face of a lion, even " the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the~
way of the Lord, make His paths straight " but the John of whom I write is~
like a flying eagle, (Apoc. iv. 7,) whose kingly flight beareth him up above~
earth-gathered clouds, an eagle that wingeth his way toward the Father Himself,~
and which crieth: " In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,~
and the Word was God."

Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 20:20-23
Azon időben odament hozzá a Zebedeus fiak anyja a fiaival együtt, és leborult~
előtte, hogy kérjen tőle valamit. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest at Bethlehem.
!Comment, on Matt. xx. Bk. 3.
Whence had the mother of Zebedee's children gotten her idea of the Lord's kingdom~
He had but just said "The Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests~
and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him~
to the Gentiles to mock, (and to scourge,) and to crucify Him." He had told His~
trembling disciples of the outrages that awaited Him in His Passion and yet~
that mother came to Him to ask for her sons a share in the glory of His Triumph. I~
think it was because the Lord, after He had said all the rest, had said also~
"And the third day He shall rise again." The woman supposed that after His~
resurrection His kingdom would immediately be established, and that that would~
be fulfilled at His first coming which is promised at His second. And so, with~
womanly haste, she forgetteth the future, and catcheth at the present.

[Lectio8]
It was the mother who asked, but the Lord addressed His answer to the disciples,~
understanding that she had made her prayer in obedience to their wishes. "Are ye~
able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of?" From God's written Word we~
gather that by this cup, He meant the Passion, touching the which we read that~
He said " O My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me!" Likewise~
is it written in the hundred-and-fifteenth Psalm "I will take the cup of~
salvation, and call upon the Name of the Lord," and what that life-giving cup~
was, the words which soon follow tell us " Precious in the sight of the Lord~
is the death of His Saints."

[Lectio9]
The question ariseth, how the two sons of Zebedee, James namely and John, drank~
of the cup of contention even unto blood against sin, seeing that though we know~
by the Scriptures that " Herod the king killed James the brother of John with~
the sword," yet John ended his earthly life by a natural death. But if we read~
the Records of the Church, we shall find there told how that John, on account of~
his testifying to the truth, was cast into a vessel of boiling oil, and although~
the holy champion came out unhurt and continued his pilgrimage here for a while~
longer, before he received his crown from Christ's hand, being straightway~
banished into the isle of Patmos, yet we see that he had the soul of a martyr,~
and drank the same cup of martyrdom that was drunk by the three children in the~
burning fiery furnace, albeit the persecutor did not actually shed his blood.
