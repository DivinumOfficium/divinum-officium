!Sir 25:5-13
5 The things that thou hast not gathered in thy youth, how shalt thou find them in thy old age?
6 O how comely is judgment for a grey head, and for ancients to know counsel!
7 O how comely is wisdom for the aged, and understanding and counsel to men of honour!
8 Much experience is the crown of old men, and the fear of God is their glory.
9 Nine things that are not to be imagined by the heart have I magnified, and the tenth I will utter to men with my tongue.
10 A man that hath joy of his children: and he that liveth and seeth the fall of his enemies.
11 Blessed is he. that dwelleth with a wise woman, and that hath not slipped with his tongue, and that hath not served such as are unworthy of him.
12 Blessed is he that findeth a true friend, and that declareth justice to an ear that heareth.
13 How great is he that findeth wisdom and knowledge! but there is none above him that feareth the Lord.

!Sir 24:14-21
14 From the beginning, and before the world, was I created, and unto the world to come I shall not cease to be, and in the holy dwelling place I have ministered before him.
15 And so was I established in Sion, and in the holy city likewise I rested, and my power was in Jerusalem.
16 And I took root in an honourable people, and in the portion of my God his inheritance, and my abode is in the full assembly of saints.
17 I was exalted like a cedar in Libanus, and as a cypress tree on mount Sion.
18 I was exalted like a palm tree in Cades, and as a rose plant in Jericho:
19 As a fair olive tree in the plains, and as a plane tree by the water in the streets, was I exalted.
20 I gave a sweet smell like cinnamon. and aromatical balm: I yielded a sweet odour like the best myrrh:

In the year of our renewed salvation 1531, the Virgin Mother occasioned herself to appear to Juan Diego, a pious and undeveloped neophyte, in Mexico on Tepeyac hill, as ancient and constant tradition relates, and speaking very benevolently to him, commanded him to visit the Bishop to report that he must erect a holy shrine there. Juan de Zumarraga, the Bishop of that place, delayed a response, skillfully testing the truth: and he commanded the neophyte, again influenced by the vision and command of the Blessed Virgin, to repeat his mission with tears and prayers, that he might earnestly seek a sign, by which the great mother of God might show her will.

[Responsory4]
R. And there appeared a great wonder in heaven: a Woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet,
* And upon her head is a crown of twelve stars.
V. The foundations thereof are in the holy mountains, the Lord loveth the gates of Sion above all the tabernacles of Jacob.
R. And upon her head is a crown of twelve stars.

[Lectio5]
While the neophyte traveled by a more distant way from Tepeyac hill, and hastening to call for a Mexican priest, so that the Last Sacraments would not be wanting for his uncle, who had been stricken with a deadly disease, the most kindly Virgin appeared to him a third time; informed the grieving man about his uncles health; and arranging beautiful roses in his tilma, recently flowering against the harshness of the place and the winter, she charged him to bring them to the Bishop. Diego yielded to the commands, and on his tilma, the roses having been dropped before the Bishop, the image of holy Mary, by which sight she entirely displayed herself on the hill near the city, was seen depicted in a miraculous way. By such a wonder the awestruck men duly desired to preserve the religious portrait in the bishops shrine: which, a little while after, with solemn ceremony was transferred to the shrine built on Tepeyac hill, shining forth for the conspicuous veneration of all peoples.

[Responsory5]
R. Who is she, who ascendeth as the breaking dawn,

Thereafter, it having been removed to the magnificent church, to which the Roman Pontiffs added College of Canons to add the splendour of divine worship, greatly increasing the piety of the Mexican people for the Mother of God; and since then the frequency of people and miracles was maintained for four remarkable centuries. Wherefore, so that She would be a present protector against public and private calamity, the Mexican Archbishop and other bishops of that region, by the agreement of all orders, appointed Her Patron of all the Nations of Mexico, and Benedict XIV duly declared the choice, by his apostolic authority, and granted the recitation of an Office and Mass under the title of the blessed Virgin of Guadalupe. And Leo XIII, kindly agreeing to the repeated prayers of the President of the Mexicans, granted this new Office to be recited, from the consultation of the Sacred Congregation of Rites, and commanded the honoured image of the Virgin with wonder and worship to be adorned with a golden crown, by his name and command, with solemn rite. And which most precious thing, on October 12, 1895, before nearly all the Bishops of all the states and many others from the rest of the regions of America, with a large crowd of natives and visitors and rejoicing, the Mexican Archbishop placed. Finally, Pius X, to satisfy the wishes of the Bishops of Latin American, declared the blessed Virgin of Guadalupe the particular Patron of all of Latin America.

[Responsory6]
R. I have chosen and made holy this place
* That my name may be there, and mine eyes, and my heart may remain there for all the days.

In the year 1531, according the religious tradition of Mexico, Mary, the Virgin Mother of God, appeared on Mount Tepeyac to a recently baptized Christian, Juan Diego, and gave him a message for Bishop Juan de Zumarraga - a commission which she urgently repeated that a church was to be built there in her honor. The bishop, however, asked for a sign. Two days later, the neophyte set out to get a priest to administer the Last Sacraments to his and he took a route that not bring him too near the place of the apparitions. But his loving Mother favored him with a third visit, assured him of his uncles good health, and had him gather some roses which had sprung out of season. These she arranged in his tilma or cloak, and she told him to take them to the bishop As the roses cascaded to the floor of the bishop's audience chain (so the story continues), the picture  of Mary, miraculously imprinted on the tilma, was revealed to those present. The image was ut first kept in the bishop's oratory then moved to the hermitage that had been built on Mount Tepceyac, and finally placed in the great basilica which became the goal of crowds of Mexican  pilgrims, drawn there by their devotion to Mary and by the reports ol frequent miracles. Having the Blessed Virgin Mary of Guadalupe as an ever present protectress, the Mexican bishops, with the approval of all the people, chose her as the primary Patron of the Mexican nation; and this choice was duly approved by the apostolic authority of Pope Benedict XIV. On Columbus Day, October 12, 1895, Pope Leo XIII, acting through the archbishop of Mexico, adorned the holy image with a golden crown. And St. Pius X declared Our Lady of Guadalupe Patroness of all of Latin America.

In that time Mary rising up in those days, went into the hill country with haste into a city of Juda. And she entered into the house of Zachary, and saluted Elizabeth. And so on.

A Homily of St. Bernard the Abbot
!De Verbis Apoc. cap. 12 ad finem
Elizabeth wondered at this person coming, saying: Whence is this to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me? And she commended this voice of salutation, adding: as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears, the infant in my womb leaped for joy: And she blessed the believing faith: Blessed, she says, art thou who hast believed. Great indeed is the reward, but also your devout humility is holding back nothing suffered by you, into whom all things are poured back more, according to whose favour they are praised.

[Responsory7]
R. Blessed are thou, O holy Virgin Mary, and most worthy of all praise,
* For out of thee arose the Sun of Righteousness, even Christ our God.
V. Pray for the people, plead for the clergy, entreat for all women dedicated to God: let everyone that celebrateth thy holy feast know the benefit of thine intercession.
R. For out of thee arose the Sun of Righteousness, even Christ our God.

Thou, she says, dost magnify the Mother of the Lord, but my soul doth magnify the Lord. At my voice you present your son to rejoice in joy, but my spirit hath exulted in God, my saviour: and he also as the friend of my spouse is glad at the voice of my spouse. Thou art to be called blessed, I who believed, but this occasion of belief and blessedness has been provided by heavenly piety; that that from henceforth all generations call me more blessed, because God hath regarded his humble and poor handmaid. But do we think, brethren, she spoke wrongly to holy Elizabeth about that which was in her through the spirit? By no means. God clearly regarded this blessed woman, and blessed her who believed. For this great fruit was brought forth of divine consideration.

[Responsory8]
R. All generations shall call me blessed,
* For the Lord that is mighty hath magnified me, and holy is his Name.
V. And his mercy is on them that fear him throughout all generations.
R. For the Lord that is mighty hath magnified me, and holy is his Name.
&Gloria
R. For the Lord that is mighty hath magnified me, and holy is his Name.

By ineffable artifice the overshadowing Spirit added so much magnanimity of humility in the great depths of the maidenly heart, that clearly such great humility will not lessen her magnanimity, nor such great magnanimity her humility. But when in her estimation she might be humble, she was also likewise magnanimous in her belief of the promise, that no one other than herself was regarded as the poor handmaid, she by no means doubted the choice for the unknowable mystery, and believed she was soon to be the true Mother of God and man. Now by thee, Mother of mercy, through the same affection of thy most pure mind, the moon having thrown itself at thy feet, established as mediatrix with the sun of justice, it interceedeth with devout supplications, that in thy light it may see the light, and may merit to obtain grace by thy sun, whom it truly loved before all, and dressed thee, clothing thee with a garment of glory, and placing a crown of beauty on thy head
