[Oratio]
O God, Who by Thy blessed servant John didst cause Thy faithful people, through~
the power of the most Holy Name of Jesus, to prevail against the enemies of His~
Cross, grant unto us, we beseech Thee, the help of the prayers of the same Thy~
servant that we may prevail against our ghostly enemies, and may be made worthy~
to receive from Thee a crown of righteousness.

This John was born at Capistrano, in the Abruzzi. He was educated at Perugia,~
and became so expert in letters, both sacred and profane, that on account of his~
eminent knowledge of law, Ladislaus, King of Naples, set him over several~
cities. He was seeking in righteousness to bring the affairs of these places out~
of trouble into peace, when he himself was kidnapped and put in chains. From~
this captivity he marvellously escaped, and then professed himself a Friar Minor~
under the rule of Francis of Assisi. Here he went forward in the study of~
divinity, and had as a teacher the holy Bernardine of Sienna, of whom he was one~
of the most marked followers, especially in spreading abroad the honour paid to~
the Most Holy Name of Jesus, and to the Mother of God. The bishopric of Aquila~
was offered to him, but he refused it. He was chiefly known by the hardship of~
his self-denial, and by the writings which he published in large numbers for the~
reform of manners.

[Lectio5]
He devoted himself without ceasing to the preaching of the Word of God, in the~
which work he travelled throughout nearly all Italy, and by the power of~
eloquence and of miracles not a few, he recalled souls almost countless into the~
path of salvation. Martin V. appointed him Inquisitor to stamp out the sect of~
the Fraticelli. Nicolas V. appointed him InquisitorGeneral in Italy against~
Judaism and Mohammadanism, and he brought many such misbelievers to believe in~
Christ. He did much good work in the affairs of the Eastern Church, and at the~
Council of Florence, wherein he shone like a sun, he brought back the Armenians~
to the Catholic church. The same Pope Nicolas V., at the request of the Emperor~
Frederick III., sent him into Germany as Nuncio of the Apostolic See, in order~
that he might bring back the heretics to the Catholic faith and the minds of the~
princes to peace and agreement. He did a wonderful work for God's glory during~
the six years that he laboured in Germany and other countries, and by his~
teaching of the truth and the striking evidence of his miracles brought back to~
the bosom of the Church almost countless numbers of Hussites, Adamites,~
Taborites, and Jews.

[Lectio6]
It was mainly at the entreaty of John that Calistus III. proclaimed a Crusade,~
and John hastened about through Pannonia and other provinces, where by his words~
and his letters he so roused the minds of princes to that holy war, that in a~
short while seventy thousand Christian soldiers were enrolled. It was mainly~
through his advice and by his power that victory was gained at Belgrade, when~
one hundred and twenty thousand Turks were either slain or put to flight. The~
news of this victory reached Rome upon the sixth day of August, and Pope~
Calistus thereupon consecrated that day for ever to the solemn commemoration of~
the transfiguration of the Lord Christ. As John lay sick unto death at Illak,~
many princes came to see him, and he exhorted them to protect religion. He gave~
up his soul in holiness to God, (upon the 23rd day of October,) in the year of~
salvation 1456. God confirmed his glory by many miracles after his death, and~
when these had been duly proved Alexander VIII. enrolled his name with those of~
the saints in the year 1690, and two hundred years after his canonization Leo~
XIII. extended his Office and Mass to the whole Church.

!Luke 9:1-6 
At that time : Jesus called~
the twelve Apostles together and gave power and authority over all devils and to~
cure diseases. And so on.
_
Homily by St Buona- Ventura, (Cardinal) Bishop (of Albans,)
!On Luke ix.
Apostles are so called as a mark of their authority, for this word Apostle~
signifieth sent, and they were sent out to preach, as it is written, (1 Cor. i.~
17,) Christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel. They were sent to~
preach not any small thing but a very great thing, even the Kingdom of God,~
whereby we may understand the teaching of the truth, as it is said, (Matth. xxi.~
43,) The Kingdom of God should be taken from you and given to a nation bringing~
forth the fruits thereof. The Kingdom of God may also be understood to signify~
the grace of the Holy Ghost, as it is written, (Rom. xiv. 17,) The Kingdom of~
God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy~
Ghost ; as also it was said, (Luke xvii. 21,) The Kingdom of God is within you.~
The Kingdom of God may also be understood to signify eternal glory, as it is~
said, (John iii. 5,) Ámen, I say unto thee, except a man be born again of water~
and of the Holy Ghost he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.

[Lectio8]
The Apostles were sent to preach the Kingdom of God in all these three senses,~
that is to say, as the true teaching, as the grace of God, and as eternal glory.~
In order to invest their teaching with authority He gave them the power to cure~
diseases, whence where it is written (2) And He sent them to preach the Kingdom~
of God it is also said And to heal the sick. This power He gave in order to~
confirm the truth of their preaching, as it is written, (Mark xvi. 20,) And they~
went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming~
the Word with signs following. The sign that a preacher is indeed sent forth by~
the Spirit of God is that they that hear him should be cured of the disease of~
sin. 

[Lectio9]
There are three manifest signs which show~
whether a preacher hath been sent by the Lord to preach the gospel. The first is~
that he should be sent by one having authority to do so, such as is a bishop,~
and above all the Pope, who is in the place of Peter, yea of Jesus Christ. So~
that he who is sent by him is sent by Christ. The second sign is a love for~
souls in the person who is sent, so that he seeketh mainly the honour of God and~
the salvation of souls. The third sign is that his hearers should bring forth~
fruit and should be converted. By the first sign a preacher is known as being~
sent by the Father, by the second he is known as being sent by the Son, by the~
third he is known as being sent by the Holy Ghost. Of the first sign it may be~
said, (Ps. xliv. 17,) Instead of Thy Father shall be Thy children ; of the~
second sign it may be said, (2 Cor. iv. 5,) We preach not ourselves, but Christ~
Jesus our Lord ; of the third sign it may be said, (John xv. 16,) I have chosen~
you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your~
fruit should remain. And he who is thus sent forth can say, (Luke iv. 18,) The~
Spirit of the Lord is upon me because He hath anointed me to preach the gospel.
