Ünnepeljük Szûz Mária Szeplõtelen Fogantatását * Imádjuk Krisztust a Királyt

[Hymnus Matutinum]
Ki szûzek ôrizôje vagy,
Istennek Anyja, folttalan,
Az égi udvar ajtaja,
A Mennyországnak öröme,
_
Liliomszál tövis között,
Szépséges szép fehér galamb,
Szûz virág, melynek gyökerén
Sebünkre gyógyír sarjadoz.
_
Megvíhatatlan vártorony,
Hajótöröttek csillaga;
Álnokság ellen légy erônk,
Fényed legyen útmutatónk.
_
Tépd el a tévelygés ködét
Zúzz el lappangó szirteket,
Segítsd az úttalan hajóst
A biztonságos part felé.
_
Dicsôség teneked Urunk,
Kinek a Szûz szülôanyád,
Atyának s Szentléleknek is,
Most és örök idôkön át.
Ámen.

!Gen 3:1-5
1 A kígyó ravaszabb volt a föld minden állatánál, amit az Úristen teremtett. Ezt~
mondta az asszonynak: "Valóban mondta Isten, hogy nem ehettek a kert valamennyi~
fájáról?"
2 Az asszony így válaszolt a kígyónak: "A kert fáinak gyümölcsébõl ehetünk.
3 Isten csak a kert közepén álló fa gyümölcsérõl mondta: Ne egyetek belõle, ne~
érintsétek, nehogy meghaljatok."
4 Erre a kígyó így beszélt az asszonyhoz: "Semmi esetre sem fogtok meghalni.
5 Isten jól tudja, hogy amely napon abból esztek, szemetek felnyílik, olyanok~
lesztek, mint az istenek, akik ismerik a jót és a rosszat."

[Responsory1]
R. By one man sin entered into the world, in whom all have sinned.
* Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found grace with God.
V. The Lord hath delivered thy soul from death, yea, the Lord was thy stay.
R. Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found grace with God.

[Lectio2]
!Gen 3:6-8
6 Az asszony látta, hogy a fa élvezhetõ, tekintetre szép, és csábít a tudás~
megszerzésére. Vett tehát gyümölcsébõl, megette, adott férjének, aki vele volt,~
és az is evett belõle.
7 Erre felnyílt a szemük, észrevették, hogy meztelenek. Fügefa leveleket fûztek~
össze, és kötényt csináltak maguknak.
8 Azután meghallották az Úristen lépteit, aki a nappali szellõben a kertben~
járkált. Az ember és az asszony elrejtõztek az Úristen elõl a kert fái között.

[Responsory2]
R. Come unto me all ye that be desirous of me
* And I will declare what God hath done for my soul.
V. As the Lord liveth, by me He hath fulfilled His mercy.
R. And I will declare what God hath done for my soul.

[Lectio3]
!Gen 3:9-15
9 De az Úristen hívta az embert és így szólt hozzá: "Hol vagy?"
10 Õ így válaszolt: "Hallottam lépteidet a kertben, s féltem, mert meztelen~
vagyok, tehát elrejtõztem."
11 De õ így szólt: "Ki adta tudtodra, hogy meztelen vagy? Ettél a fáról,~
amelyrõl megtiltottam, hogy egyél?"
12 Az ember így válaszolt: "Az asszony adott a fáról, akit mellém rendeltél,~
azért ettem."
13 Az Úristen megkérdezte az asszonyt: "Mit tettél?" Az asszony így felelt: "A~
kígyó vezetett félre, azért ettem."
14 Az Úristen így szólt a kígyóhoz: "Mivel ezt tetted, átkozott leszel minden~
állat és a mezõ minden vadja között. Hasadon csúszol, és a föld porát eszed~
életed minden napján.
15 Ellenkezést vetek közéd és az asszony közé, a te ivadékod és az õ ivadéka~
közé. Õ széttiporja fejedet, te meg a sarkát veszed célba."

[Responsory3]
R. My beloved is white like snow in Lebanon, her lips drop as the honeycomb.
* Honey and milk are under her tongue.
V. Come from Lebanon, My Spouse, thou shalt be crowned with a crown of grace.
R. Honey and milk are under her tongue.
&Gloria
R. Honey and milk are under her tongue.

[Lectio4]
From the Sermons of St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem. )
!On the Assumption.
Who and what was the blessed and glorious Mary, always a Virgin, hath been~
revealed by God by the message of an Angel, in these words, Hail, thou that art~
full of grace, the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women. It was~
fitting that a fulness of grace should be poured into that Virgin who hath given~
to God glory and to man a Saviour, who hath brought peace to earth, who hath~
given faith to the Gentiles, who hath killed sin, who hath given law to life,~
who hath made the crooked ways straight. Verily, she is full of grace. To others~
grace cometh measure by measure; in Mary grace dwelleth at once in all fulness.~
Verily, she is full of grace. We believe that the holy Fathers and Prophets had~
grace; but they were not full of grace. But into Mary came a fulness of all the~
grace which is in Christ, albeit otherwise (than as it is in Him.) Therefore is~
it said Blessed art thou among women, that is, Blessed art thou above all women.~
The fulness of blessing in Mary utterly neutralized in her any effects of the~
curse of Eve. In her praise Solomon writeth in the Song of Songs, (ii. 10,) Rise~
up, my dove, my fair one, for the winter is past, the rain is over and gone. And~
again, Come from Lebanon, my Spouse, come, thou shalt be crowned. (iv. 8.)

[Responsory4]
R. I came out of the mouth of the Most High, the first-begotten before every~
creature. I made the unfading light to arise in the heavens.
* When there were no depths I was conceived.
V. For the Lord hath created me in righteousness, and hath held mine hand, and~
hath kept me.
R. When there were no depths I was conceived.

[Lectio5]
Not unjustly then is she bidden to come from' Lebanon, for Lebanon is so named~
on account of its stainless and glistening whiteness. The earthly Lebanon is~
white with snow, but the lonely heights of Mary's holiness are white with purity~
and grace, brilliantly fair, whiter far than snow, sparkling with the gifts of~
the Holy Ghost she is undefiled like a dove, all clean, all upright, full of~
grace and truth. She is full of mercy, and of the righteousness that hath looked~
down from heaven, and therefore is she without stain because in her hath never~
been any corruption. She hath compassed a man in her womb, saith holy Jeremiah,~
but she conceived not by the will of fallen man. The Lord, saith the Prophet,~
hath created a new thing in the earth; a woman shall compass a man. (xxxi. 22.)~
Verily, it is a new thing. Verily, it was a new work of power, greater than all~
other works, when God, Whom the world cannot bear, and Whom no man shall see and~
live, entered the lodging of her womb, breaking not the blissful cloister of her~
virgin flesh. And in her body He was borne, the Infinite inclosed within her~
womb. And from her womb He came forth, so that it was fulfilled which was spoken~
of the Prophet Ezekiel, saying, This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened,~
and no man shall enter in by it; because the Lord, the God of Israel, hath~
entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut. (xliv. 2.) Hence also in the Song~
of Songs it is said of her, (iv. 12,) A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse, a~
garden enclosed, a fountain sealed, thy perfumes are a garden of delights.~
Verily a garden of delights, filled with the perfumes of all flowers, rich with~
the sweet savour of grace. And the most holy Virgin herself is a garden enclosed,~
whereinto sin and Satan have never entered to sully the blossoms, a fountain~
sealed, sealed with the seal of the Trinity. (So far the Sermon.)

[Responsory5]
R. No defiled thing can fall into her;
* She is the brightness of the everlasting light, and the unspotted mirror of~
the power of God.
V. For she is more beautiful than the sun, and being compared with the light,~
she is found before it.
R. She is the brightness of the everlasting light, and the unspotted mirror of~
the power of God.

[Lectio6]
!From the acts of Pope Pius IX
The fact that the Virgin Mother of God had at the moment of her conception~
triumphed over the foul enemy of man, hath ever been borne out by the Holy~
Scriptures, by the venerable tradition of the Church, and by her unceasing~
belief, as well as by the common conviction of all Bishops and faithful~
Catholics, and by marked acts and constitutions of the Holy See. At length the~
Supreme Pontiff Pius IX., in compliance with the wishes of the Universal Church,~
determined to publish it as a truth of faith, on his own absolute and unerring~
authority, and accordingly, on the 8th day of December, 1854, in the Vatican~
Basilica, in presence of a great multitude composed of the Fathers Cardinals of~
the Holy Roman Church, and Bishops from all parts of the earth, he, with the~
consent and jubilation of the whole world, declared and defined as follows That~
doctrine which declareth that the most blessed Virgin Mary was in the first~
instant of her Conception preserved, by a special privilege granted unto her by~
God, from any stain of original sin, is a doctrine taught and revealed by God,~
and therefore is to be held by all faithful Christians firmly and constantly.

[Responsory6]
R. There appeared a great wonder in heaven a Woman clothed with the sun, and the~
moon under her feet
* And upon her head a crown of twelve stars.
V. The Lord hath clothed her with the garments of salvation, and hath covered~
her with the robe of righteousness, yea, as a bride He hath adorned her with~
jewels.
R. And upon her head a crown of twelve stars.
&Gloria
R. And upon her head a crown of twelve stars.

Homily by St German, Patriarch (of Constantinople. )
!On the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin.
Hail, Mary, full of grace, holier than the Saints, higher than the heavens, more~
glorious than the Cherubim, more honourable than the Seraphim, and the most~
worshipful thing that the hands of God have made. Hail, O dove, bearing in thy~
beak the olive-branch of peace that telleth us of salvation from the spiritual~
flood, (Gen. viii. 10, n,) dove, blessed omen of a safe harbour, whose wings are~
of silver, and thy feathers of gold, shining in the bright beams of the Most~
Holy and Light-giving Spirit. (Ps. lxvii. 14.) Hail, thou living garden of Eden,~
planted towards the East by the right hand of the Most Merciful and Mighty God,~
wherein do grow to His glory rich lilies and unfading roses, for the healing of~
them that have drunk in death from the blighting and pestilential breezes of the~
bitter West, (Gen. ii. 8, 9); Eden, wherein hath sprung that Tree of life,~
Whereof if any man eat he shall live for ever. (Gen. ii. 9; iii. 22. John vi.~
52.) Hail, stately Palace of the King, most holy, stainless, purest, House of~
the Most High God, adorned with His Royal splendour, open to all, filled with~
Kingly dainties; Palace wherein is that spiritual bridal chamber, not made with~
hands, nor hung with divers colours, in the which the Eternal Word, when He~
would raise up fallen man, wedded flesh unto Himself, that He might reconcile~
unto the Father them who had cast themselves away.

[Responsory7]
R. A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse, a garden enclosed, a fountain~
sealed.
* O Mary, thy perfumes are a garden of delights.
V. Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled.
R. O Mary, thy perfumes are a garden of delights.

[Lectio8]
Hail, O rich and shady Mountain of God, whereon pastured the True Lamb, Who hath~
taken away our sins and infirmities, (Hab. iii. 3; Isa. liii. 4; John i. 29,)~
mountain, whereout hath been cut without hands that Stone which hath smitten the~
altars of the idols, and become the head-stone of the corner, marvellous in our~
eyes. (Dan. ii. 34; Ps. cxvii. 22, 23.) Hail, thou holy Throne of God, thou~
divinest store-house, thou temple of glory, thou bright crown, thou chosen~
treasure, thou mercy-seat for the whole world, thou heaven declaring the glory~
of God. (Ps. xviii. 2.) Hail, thou vessel of pure gold, made to hold the manna~
that came down from heaven, the sweet food of our souls, even Christ. (Ex.~
xvi.33; Heb. ix. 4; John vi. 49-51.) Hail, O purest Virgin, most praiseworthy~
and most worshipful, hallowed treasury for the wants of all creatures; thou art~
the untitled earth, the unploughed field; thou art the vine full of flowers, the~
well overflowing with waters, Maiden and Mother; thou art the Mother that knew~
not a man, the hidden treasure of guilelessness, and the clear, bright star of~
holiness; by thy most acceptable prayers, strong from thy motherly mouth, obtain~
for all estates of men in the Church that they may continually tend unto Him Who~
is the Lord, and God, and Maker of thee, and of them, and of all, but of thee~
the Son also, conceived without man's intervention; obtain this, O Mother, pilot~
them to the harbour of peace.

[Responsory8]
R. My soul doth magnify the Lord
* For He That is mighty hath done to me great things, and holy is His name.
V. For, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.
R. For He That is mighty hath done to me great things, and holy is His name.
&Gloria
R. For He That is mighty hath done to me great things, and holy is His name.

[Lectio9]
Be it thine to clothe God's priests with righteousness, and to make them shout~
aloud for joy (Ps. cxxxi. 9, 16,) in approved and stainless, and upright and~
glorious faith. thine be it to guide in peace the sceptres of orthodox princes,~
even of princes who put their trust in thee to be the crown of their Majesty,~
and the Royal Robe of their greatness, and the firm foundation of their dominion,~
more than in purple, or fine gold, or pearls, or precious stones; thine be it to~
put under their feet the unfaithful nations, nations that blaspheme thee, and~
the God That was born of thee; thine be it to keep in meek obedience the people~
that are under them, according to the commandment of God. Behold, this is thine~
own city, which hath thee for her towers and her foundations, crown her with~
victory, gird the house of God with strength, keep undefiled the loveliness of~
His tabernacles, as for them that praise thy name, be thou their deliverer from~
strife and bitterness of spirit. Free thou the prisoner, protect the wanderer,~
and if there be any that hath no refuge, be thou to him a consolation. Stretch~
forth thine hand and help the whole earth so shall we year by year keep this and~
all thy feasts, and at last be found with thee in Christ Jesus, Who is Lord of~
all, and verily our God. To Him, with the Holy Father, Who is the Fountain of~
Life, and the coeternal Spirit, Three Persons and One Substance, even as there~
is one Kingdom, be glory and strength, now and for ever. Amen.
