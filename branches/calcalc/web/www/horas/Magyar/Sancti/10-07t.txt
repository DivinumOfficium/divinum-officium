!Commemoratio S. Marci Papae
This Mark was a Roman, who sat as Pope in the reign of the Emperor Constantine~
the Great. He ordained that the Bishop of Ostia, by whom the Bishop of Rome is~
consecrated, should use the Pallium. He built two Churches, one in the city and~
the other on the Ardeatine Way, which Constantine enlarged and richly gifted.~
Mark lived as Pope eight months, and was buried in the Cemetery of Balbina.
