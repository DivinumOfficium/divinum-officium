[Oratio]
O God, Who didst make thy blessed Confessor Andrew to settle in his heart to go~
up wondrously toward thee by a stern vow daily to advance to the utmost of his~
power in godliness, grant unto us for the same thy servant's sake and at his~
prayers the like grace, so that we, seeking ever that which is more perfect, may~
happily attain the crown of thine everlasting glory.

[Lectio4]
Lancelot Avelino, who afterwards took the name of Andrew, was born at Castro~
Nuovo, a small town in Lucania, (in the kingdom of Naples, in the year of our~
Lord 1520.) From his earliest childhood he gave no dark signs of the holiness of~
his after life. When as a lad he was away from home at school, he so passed the~
slippery paths of that age, as ever keeping before his eyes, amid the pursuit of~
earthly knowledge, the true beginning of wisdom, which is the fear of the Lord.~
~(Prov. ix. 10.) He was exceedingly comely, but withal careful in purity, and~
thereby escaped oftentimes the shameless proposals of women, and somewhiles even~
resisted open violence. He had already become a clerk when he went to Naples to~
study law. There he was ordained Priest, and also took his degree in~
Jurisprudence. He undertook cases only in the Church Courts, and for certain~
private persons, according to the rules of the Sacred Canons. l Once in pleading a~
cause, in a matter indeed which was of no weight, a lie escaped him. Almost~
forthwith thereafter, in reading the Holy Scriptures, he came upon the words:~
The mouth that lieth killeth the soul (Wisd. i. 11) and so great was the grief~
and remorse which he felt for his sin that he made up his mind to leave that way~
of life. He therefore gave up his law business, and set himself altogether to~
mind the worship of God and the execution of his holy ministry. The eminent~
pattern which he gave of all the graces proper to a Churchman moved the~
Archbishop of Naples to commit to him the care of a certain nunnery in that~
city. The holy man's zeal (for removing all obstacles to the recollection of~
these spouses of Christ, in which consisteth the very essence of their state and~
virtue,) stirred up the malice and rage of certain wicked men in the city, (whom~
he had forbid being admitted to the grate to speak to any of the nuns.) He once~
narrowly escaped death, with which they threatened him; and another time~
received three wounds in his face from a bully. These injuries he bore with~
thorough meekness. Out of an earnest desire of more readily attaining to a~
perfect disengagement of his heart from all earthly things, he humbly sought and~
~(in 1556) obtained to be admitted into the Order of Regular Clerks, (called~
Theatins,) and on this occasion, out of the love he bore to the Cross, he~
entreated that his name might be changed from Lancelot to Andrew.

[Lectio5]
He entered manfully and cheerily upon the harder life, set to work to better~
himself therein, and to that end made two very grim vows, the first, perpetually~
to fight against his own will, the second, always to advance to the utmost of~
his power in Christian perfection. Of the discipline of his Order he was a stern~
defender, and when he was set over others the observance thereof was his great~
care. Whatever time the duties of his work and his institute left him, he gave~
to prayer and the salvation of souls. His godliness and wisdom in hearing of~
confessions were beautiful. He went many times through the farthest lanes and~
suburbs of Naples, bringing Gospel ministry with great gain of souls. The~
greatness of his love toward his neighbour God was pleased to crown even by~
signs and wonders. One stormy night he was coming home from hearing a sick man's~
confession, when the rain and wind put out the light which was carried before~
him, but he and they that were with him not only came dry through the thickest~
of the rain, but there came also a strange light out of his body and showed them~
the way in the deepest of the darkness. He was a wonderful instance of~
selfcontrol, long-suffering, lowliness, and hatred of self. He bore with~
stillness the murder of his nephew, held in the passion of his kinsfolk to take~
revenge, and even asked pity for the assassins from the judges.

[Lectio6]
He spread in many places the Institute of Regular Clerks, and founded their~
houses at Milan and Piacenza. The holy Cardinal Charles Borromeo, and the~
Cardinal Paul of Arezzo, being himself a Regular Clerk, men by both of whom he~
was well liked, used his help in their care for souls. Toward the Virgin Mother~
of God he was constant in an extraordinary love and reverence. He won the~
conversation of Angels, whom he said he used to hear singing when he was~
praising God. He set an ensample of the highest graces, even to the gift of~
prophecy, whereby he saw into men's hearts and knew things afar off or even yet~
to come. Full of years and worn out with work, he was beginning the Liturgy,~
when, having repeated thrice the words, I will go unto the Altar of God, he was~
felled by a stroke of apoplexy, and, duly fortified by the Sacraments, in the~
arms of his friends, most peacefully gave up his soul to God, (upon the 10th day~
of November, in the year 1608.) The crowds which flock to his grave in the~
Church of St Paul at Naples are still as great as they were when his body was~
first laid there. He was famous for signs and wonders both during his life and~
after his death, and Pope Clement XI solemnly enrolled his name among those of~
the Saints.

!Commemoration for Blessed Martyrs Tryphone et companions
In the reign of the Emperor Decius one Tryphon strove by preaching the faith of~
Jesus Christ to bring all men to worship Him. For this cause he was taken by the~
servants of Decius. He was first tormented upon the rack, and flesh stripped~
from him with iron claws; then red-hot nails were driven into his insteps, he~
was beaten with cudgels and scarified with lighted torches. The sight of the~
courage wherewith he bore all, brought the Praefect Respicius to believe in the~
Lord Christ, and he forthwith declared himself a Christian. He also was divers~
ways tormented, and then led along with Tryphon before the statue of Jupiter.~
When Tryphon prayed, the statue fell down. Then were both Tryphon and Respicius~
savagely lashed with whips loaded with lead, until they grasped the crown of a~
most glorious testimony, upon the 10th day of November. Upon the same day a~
certain maiden named Nympha, having openly confessed that Jesus Christ is very~
God, added the palm of martyrdom to the crown of virginity.

[Lectio94]
Andrew Avellino, previously called Lancelot, was born at Castro Nuovo, a village in Lucania.. He learned jurisprudence et Naples, was ordained priest, and began to practice law, through only in eccl;ecclesiastical courts. But once, when he was presenting a case, he let slip a small lie, and then happened upon the words of Scripture: "A lying mouth slays the soul". He was seized with remorse and sorrow, abandoned the practice of law, and begged to be admitted among the Clerks Regular. Successful in this  petition, he also obtained by prayer, on account of the great love of Cross, with which he burned, the favor of being given the name Andrew. He was outstanding for his abstinence, patience, humility and contempt of self. He caused the Order of Clerks to spread in wonderful way. He honored the Virgin mother of God, with a singular love and reverence. After giving heroic examples of virtue, worn with old age and broken by his labors, as he was beginning the celebration of Mass, after the third repetition of the words, "I will go into the altare of God", he suffered a stroke and apoplexy and died pacefully soon afterwards fortified by the sacraments.
