v. In wondrous mode set free, lo, at the Lord's command
The galling iron chain doth fall from Peter's hand,
From Peter, shepherd blest, who doth with gentle sway,
His faithful children lead in virtue's fragrant way,
And e'er with watchful love the tempter drive away.
_
Now to the Father be eternal glory done;
Our songs we raise to thee, O everlasting Son;
O Spirit from on high, thy throne we bow before;
To thee be honour, praise, and glory evermore:
The Holy Trinity we worship and adore.
Ámen.

Peter, whatever thou shalt bind on earth,

Is loosed in heaven's supremest Court on high:
To judgment shalt thou come, when the world's end is nigh.

From the Acts of Apostles.
!Acts 12:1-5
1 Ebben az időben Heródes király elfogatta az egyház néhány tagját, hogy ártson~
nekik.
2 János testvérét, Jakabot karddal kivégeztette.
3 Amikor látta, hogy ezzel megnyerheti a zsidók tetszését, azon volt, hogy~
Pétert is elfogassa. A kovásztalan kenyér ünnepét ülték.
4 Elfogatta, börtönbe záratta, és rábízta négy, egyenként négy katonából álló~
őrségre. Az volt a szándéka, hogy húsvét után a nép elé vezetteti.
5 Míg Pétert fogva tartották a börtönben, az egyház állandóan imádkozott érte az~
Istenhez.

!Acts 12:6-8
6 Azon az éjszakán, amikor Heródes elő akarta vezettetni, Péter két katona~
között aludt, kettős lánccal megbilincselve. A bejáratnál őrök tartották szemmel a~
börtönt.
7 Egyszerre csak megjelent az Úr angyala, a helyiséget pedig fény árasztotta el.~
~(Az angyal) oldalba lökte Pétert, s fölébresztette: "Kelj fel gyorsan!" mondta.~
Erre a láncok lehulltak a kezéről.
8 Aztán így folytatta az angyal: "Csatold fel övedet, és vedd fel sarudat!"~
Amikor megtette, tovább sürgette: "Vedd magadra köntösödet, és kövess!"

!Acts 12:9-11
9 Ment és követte, de nem tudta, hogy valóság-e, amit vele az angyal tesz. Azt~
gondolta, látomása van.
10 Átmentek az első őrségen, majd a másodikon is, aztán eljutottak a város felé~
nyíló vaskapuhoz, és ez magától kinyílt előttük. Kint még végigmentek az egyik~
utcán, aztán az angyal hirtelen eltűnt mellőle.
11 Amikor Péter föleszmélt, megszólalt: - "Most már csakugyan tudom, hogy az Úr~
elküldte angyalát, és kiszabadított Heródes kezéből, s abból, amire a zsidó nép~
számított."

In (the year of our Lord 439, in) the reign of the Emperor Theodosius the~
younger, his wife went to Jerusalem in fulfilment of a vow, and there was gifted~
with many presents. Among other things, they gave her in especial an iron chain,~
adorned with gold and precious stones, which they affirmed to be the same~
wherewith the Apostle Peter had been bound by King Herod. Eudocia, with godly~
reverence, afterwards sent this chain to Rome, to her daughter Eudoxia, who~
brought it to the Pope, and the Pope in return showed to her another chain~
wherewith the same Apostle had been shackled under the Emperor Nero.

[Responsory4]
@Sancti/06-29:Responsory4

[Lectio5]
When then the Pope put together the Roman chain and that which had been brought~
from Jerusalem, it came to pass that they got so entangled the one with the~
other that they seemed no longer two but one chain. From this wonder these holy~
fetters began to receive such honour, that Eudoxia's Church of St Peter on the~
Esquiline Mount was dedicated under the name of St Peter in - Chains, and a Feast~
Day instituted upon the first day of August in memory of it.

@Sancti/06-29:Responsory5

[Lectio6]
From that time forth the honour which before had used to be paid to the profane~
festivity of the Gentiles, (held in memory of the dedication of the temple of~
Mars, and of the birth of Claudius,) began to be turned to the Chains of Peter,~
whose very touch healed the sick, and drove out devils. Among other such cases~
there befell in the year of man's Redemption 969, that of a certain Count, a~
servant of the Emperor Otho, who was possessed by an unclean spirit, and tore~
himself with his own teeth. This man the Emperor ordered to be taken to Pope~
John, and as soon as he had touched the Count's neck with the hallowed chains,~
the foul spirit came out of him, and left him free. And thenceforward the~
reverence for these holy chains greatly increased in the City.

Evangélium Szt Máté Apostol könyvéből
!Matt 16:13-19
Abban az időben amikor Jézus Fülöp Cezáreájának vidékére ért, megkérdezte~
tanítványaitól: "Kinek tartják az emberek az Emberfiát?" És így tovább.

Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!29th on the Saints.
Peter was the only one of the Apostles who was worthy to hear the words Amen, I~
say unto thee that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My Church.~
Worthy indeed must he be, who, when the nations are to be built up into a Temple~
of God, is chosen as the ground-stone whereon the building is to stand the~
pillar whereby it is to be held up, and the key wherethrough entrance is to be~
made into the kingdom. Concerning him the Word of God saith That they brought~
forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the~
least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them. (Acts v.~
15.) If the shadow of his body then could give help, how much more shall the~
fulness of his strength give help now If the very air, as he passed by, was~
then profitable to such as besought him, how much more shall his favour profit~
where now he abideth It is with reason that, throughout all the Churches of~
Christ, the iron chains wherewith he was afflicted are reckoned more precious~
than gold.

[Lectio8]
If his shadow as a visitor was so healthful, what is his chain now that he~
bindeth and looseth If his empty image in the air had healing power, how much~
power must have been contracted from his body by those chains, whose iron weight~
sank into his holy limbs during his suffering If, before he testified, he was~
so mighty to aid them that called upon him, how much mightier is he now since~
his victory Blessed were the links, doomed to be changed from fetters and shackles,~
into a crown, which by touching the Apostle, made him a Martyr. Blessed were the~
chains, whose prisoner left them for the Cross of Christ, and which brought him~
thither, not as the instruments of condemnation, but of sanctification.

!Commemoratio for the Holy Martyrs.
From the Sermons of St Gregory of Nazianzus (Patriarch of Constantinople)
!Sermon 20th on the Machabees.
What were the Machabees For it is under their name that the Festival at which~
you are this day assembled is kept. It is true that many persons do not hold~
them in honour, because they fought before the coming of Christ nevertheless~
they deserve to be venerated by all men, for they bore themselves bravely and~
faithfully in defence of the laws and ordinances of their people. They that~
underwent martyrdom before Christ came, what would not have been their deeds, if~
they had suffered persecution after He came, and had had before them for a~
pattern the Death which He embraced for the sake of man's salvation With no~
ensample to lead them, their bravery was what it was had they had the ensample~
before their eyes, would they not have gone down with double nerve to the battle~
There is a mystic and subtle idea, which seemeth very likely to me and to all~
lovers of God, that none of those who were crowned with martyrdom before Christ~
came, could have been so, unless they had had faith in Christ.

[Lectio94]
In the reign of the Emperor Theodosius the younger, his wife Eudocia was gifted in Jerusalem with, among other things, an iron chain, which they affirmed to be the same wherewith the Apostle Peter had been bound by King Herod. Eudocia, with godly reverence, sent this chain to her daughter Eudoxia in Rome, where it was placed by the Pope with another chain wherewith the same blessed Apostle had been shackled under the Emperor Nero. The two chains got so entangled the one with the other that they seemed no longer two but one chain made by a single workman. The very touch of these holy fetters often healed the sick and drave out devils, and so they began to receive such honour, that Eudoxia's Church of St. Peter on the Esquiline Mount was dedicated under the name of St. Peter-in-Chains, and a Feastday in its memory instituted upon the first day of August, replacing the profane festívity of the pagans held on that day.
