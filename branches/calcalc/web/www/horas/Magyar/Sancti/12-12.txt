!Luke 1:26-28
At that time the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee, called Nazareth, to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. And so on.
_
Homily by St Tarasius, Patriarch (of Constantinople.)
!On the Presentation of the Mother of God.
O Mary, where shall I find words to praise thee? Maiden undefiled, virgin~
unstained, exaltation of women, glory of daughters! Holy Maiden Mother, blessed~
art thou among women, thy glory is in thy guilelessness, and thy name is a name~
of purity. In thee the curse of Adam is done away, and the debt of Eve paid.~
Thou art the clean offering of Abel, chosen out of the firstlings profession~
thereof to be made at of the flock, a pure sacrifice. Thou art the hope of~
Enoch, that firm hope that he had in God, and was not ashamed. Thou art the~
grace that was in Enoch in this life, and his transit to a better. Thou art~
the Holy Ark of Noah, and the bond of reconciliation with God in a new~
regeneration. Thou art the exceeding glory of the kingdom and Priesthood of~
Melchisedech. Thou art the unshaken trust of Abraham, and his faith in the~
promise of children that were to-be. Thou art the renewed oblation and the~
reasonable burntoffering of Isaac. Thou art the ladder that Jacob saw going up~
to heaven, and the most noble of all his children throughout the twelve tribes~
of Israel. According to the flesh thou art the daughter of Judah. Thou art the~
modesty of Joseph, and the overthrow of the old Egypt, yea, and of the Synagogue~
of the Jews. O purest! Thou art the book of Moses the Lawgiver, whereon the new~
covenant is written with the finger of God, for the new Israel, fleeing from the~
spiritual Egypt, even as the old law was written upon Sinai, for the old Israel,~
that Israel which was fed in the wilderness upon manna and water from the rock,~
whereof both were types of Christ, which was yet to come from thy womb, as a~
bridegroom from his chamber. Thou art Aaron's rod that budded. Thou art David's~
daughter, all glorious within, clothed in a vesture of gold, wrought about with~
divers colours.
