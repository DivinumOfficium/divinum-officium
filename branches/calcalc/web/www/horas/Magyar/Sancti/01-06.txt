[Ant Vespera]
The Lord our Saviour, * begotten before the day-star, and before the ages, is this day made manifest in the world.
O Jerusalem, * thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee, and the Gentiles shall walk in thy light. Alleluia.
When the wise men * had opened their treasures, they presented unto the Lord gold, frankincense, and myrrh. Alleluia.
O ye seas and floods, * bless ye the Lord. O ye wells, bless ye the Lord. Alleluia.

[Hymnus Vespera]
{:H-CrudelisHerodes:}v. Gonosz Heródes, mit remegsz,
Hogy Isten úgy jő, mint király;
Mulandó jót el nem ragad,
Ki mennyországot osztogat.
_
Vonulnak már a Mágusok,
A csillag jár útjuk előtt.
A fény nyomán a Fényt lesik,
Istent vallanak kincseik.
_
Zokognak a szegény anyák
Megölt szemfényeik fölött.
Ezerével áldozta meg
A zsarnok őket Krisztusért.
_
A tiszta víz hullámai
Az égi Bárányt illetik.
Melyekben részessége nincs:
Mirólunk mossa bűneink.
_
Dicsőség teneked Urunk,
Ki megjelentél e napon;
Atyának s Szentléleknek is,
Most és örök időkön át.
Ámen.

Olvasmány Izaiás próféta könyvéből
!Isa 55:1-4
1 Ti szomjazók, gyertek a vizekre mind, és bár nincsen pénzetek, siessetek ide! Vegyetek ingyen gabonát és egyetek, vegyetek pénz nélkül bort és tejet. 
2 Miért költitek a pénzt arra, ami nem kenyér, és a keresetet arra, ami jól nem lakat? Hallgassatok ide, figyeljetek rám, akkor jót esztek, és kövér falatokban lesz részetek. 
3 Fordítsátok ide a fületek és gyertek ide hozzám; hallgassatok rám, és élni fog lelketek. Örök szövetséget kötök veletek, a Dávidnak megígért irgalom jegyében. 
4 Nézd, tanúul rendeltelek a népeknek, vezérül és parancsolóul a nemzeteknek. 

[Responsory1]
R. This day, when the Lord was baptized in Jordan, the heavens were opened, and~
the Spirit descended like a dove, and abode upon Him, and, lo, the voice of the~
Father was heard, like unto thunder, saying
* This is My beloved Son, in Whom I am well pleased.
V. The Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon Him, and a voice~
came from heaven
R. This is My beloved Son, an Whom I am well pleased.

[Responsory1InfraOctavam]
R. There are three precious gifts which the wise men offered unto the Lord on~
this day, and they speak a mystery of the things of God,
* Gold, to show His kingly power; frankincense, for our Great High Priest; and~
myrrh, against the Lord's burying.
V. The wise men worshipped the Captain of our Salvation, as He lay in the manger,~
and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto Him mystic gifts.
R. Gold, to show His kingly power; frankincense, for our Great High Priest; and~
myrrh, against the Lord's burying.

!Isa 60:1-6
1 Kelj föl, ragyogj föl, mert elérkezett világosságod, és az Úr dicsősége felragyogott fölötted! 
2 Mert még sötétség borítja a földet, és homály a nemzeteket, de fölötted ott ragyog az Úr, és dicsősége megnyilvánul rajtad. 
3 Népek jönnek világosságodhoz, és királyok a benned támadt fényességhez. 
4 Hordozd körül tekintetedet és lásd: mind egybegyűlnek és idejönnek hozzád. Fiaid messze távolból érkeznek, s a lányaidat ölükben hozzák. 
5 Ennek láttára földerülsz, szíved dobog az örömtől és kitágul. Mert feléd áramlik a tengerek gazdagsága, és ide özönlik a nemzetek kincse. 
6 Tevék áradata borít majd el, Midián és Efa dromedárjai. Mind Sábából jönnek; aranyat és tömjént hoznak és az Úr dicsőségét zengik.

!Isa 61:10-11; 62:1
10 "Ujjongó örömmel örülök az Úrban, lelkem ujjong az én Istenemben, mert az üdvösség ruhájába öltöztetett, s az igaz élet köntösébe burkolt, mint a vőlegényt, aki koszorút visel, és mint a menyasszonyt, aki ékszerekkel díszíti magát. 
11 Mert amint a föld megtermi növényeit, és a kert kisarjasztja a veteményeket, úgy sarjasztja ki az Úr az igazságosságot, és a magasztalást, minden nép színe előtt." 
1 Sion miatt nem hallgathatok, és Jeruzsálem miatt nem nyugszom, míg föl nem ragyog igazsága, mint a hajnal, és szabadulása, mint a fáklya, nem tündököl.

From the Sermons of Pope St Leo (the Great)
!2nd for Twelfth-Day.
Dearly beloved brethren, rejoice in the Lord; again I say, rejoice. But a few~
days are past since the solemnity of Christ's Birth, and now the glorious light~
of His Manifestation is breaking upon us. On that day the Virgin brought Him~
forth, and on this the world knew Him. The Word made Flesh was pleased to reveal~
Himself by degrees to those for whom He had come. When Jesus was born He was~
manifested indeed to the believing, but hidden from His enemies. Already indeed~
the heavens declared the glory of God, and their sound went out into all lands,~
when the Herald Angels appeared to tell to the shepherds the glad tidings of a~
Saviour's Birth; and now the guiding star leadeth the wise men to worship Him,~
that from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the Birth of the true~
King may be known abroad; that through those wise men the kingdoms of the east~
might learn the great truth, and the Roman empire remain no more in darkness.

[Responsory4]
R. Shine, shine, O Jerusalem, for thy light is come
* And the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.
V. And the Gentiles shall walk in thy light, and kings in the brightness of thy~
rising.
R. And the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.

[Lectio5]
The very cruelty of Herod, when he strove to crush at His birth this King Whom~
he alone feared, was made a blind means to carry out this dispensation of mercy.~
While the tyrant with horrid guilt sought to slay the little Child he did not~
know, amid an indiscriminate slaughter of innocents, his infamous act served to~
spread wider abroad the heaven-told news of the Birth of the Lord. Thus were~
these glad tidings loudly proclaimed, both by the novelty of their story, and~
the iniquity of their enemies. Then was the Saviour borne into Egypt, that~
nation, of a long time hardened in idolatry, might by the mysterious virtue~
which went out of Him, even when His presence was unknown, be prepared for the~
saving light so soon to dawn on them, and might receive the Truth as a wanderer~
even before they had banished falsehood.

[Responsory5]
R. All they from Saba shall come, they shall bring gold and incense, and they~
shall show forth the praises of the Lord.
* Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
V. The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents, the kings of~
Arabia and Saba shall offer gifts.
R. Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.

[Lectio6]
Dearly beloved brethren, we recognise in the wise men who came to worship Christ,~
the first-fruits of that dispensation to the Gentiles wherein we also are called~
and enlightened. Let us then keep this Feast with grateful hearts, in~
thanksgiving for our blessed hope, whereof it doth commemorate the dawn. From~
that worship paid to the new-born Christ is to be dated the entry of us Gentiles~
upon our heirship of God and co-heirship with Christ. Since that joyful day the~
Scriptures which testify of Christ have lain open for us as well as for the~
Jews. Yea, their blindness rejected that Truth, Which, since that day, hath shed~
Its bright beams upon all nations. Let all observance, then, be paid to this~
most sacred day, whereon the Author of our salvation was made manifest, and as~
the wise men fell down and worshipped Him in the manger, so let us fall down and~
worship Him enthroned Almighty in heaven. As they also opened their treasures~
and presented unto Him mystic and symbolic gifts, so let us strive to open our~
hearts to Him, and offer Him from thence some worthy offering.

[Responsory6]
R. There came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, asking and saying Where is~
He That is born King of the Jews? for we have seen His star in the east
* And are come to worship the Lord.
V. We have seen His star in the east.
R. And are come to worship the Lord.
&Gloria
R. And are come to worship the Lord.

Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 2:1-12
Amikor a júdeai Betlehemben Heródes király idejében Jézus megszületett, bölcsek jöttek napkeletről Jeruzsálembe és kérdezősködtek: "Hol van a zsidók újszülött királya? És így tovább.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great.)
!10th on the Gospels.
Dearly beloved brethren, hear ye from the Gospel lesson how, when the King of~
heaven was born, the king of earth was troubled? The heights of heaven are~
opened and the depths of earth are stirred. Let us now consider the question,~
why, when the Redeemer was born, an angel brought the news to the shepherds of~
Judea, but a star led the wise men of the East to worship Him. It seemeth as if~
the Jews as reasonable creatures received a revelation from a reasonable being,~
that is, an angel, but the Gentiles without, being as brutes, are roused not by a~
voice, but by a sign, that is, a star. Hence Paul hath it: a sign, not to them~
that believe, but to them that believe not but prophesying serveth not for~
them that believe not, but for them which believe. (1 Cor. xiv. 22.) So the~
prophesying, (that is, of the angel) was given to them that believed, and the~
sign to them that believed not.

[Responsory7]
R. The star which the wise men had seen in the East, went before them, till they~
came where the young Child was.
* And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
V. And when they were come into the house, they found the young Child with Mary~
His Mother, and fell down and worshipped Him.
R. And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.

[Lectio8]
Thus also we remark that afterwards the Redeemer was preached among the Gentiles~
not by Himself, but by His Apostles, even as, when a little Child, He is shown~
to them, not by the voice of angels, but merely by the vision of a star. When He~
Himself had begun to speak He was made known to us by speakers, but when He lay~
silent in the manger, by that silent testimony in heaven. But whether we~
consider the signs which accompanied His birth or His death, this thing is~
wonderful, namely, the hardness of heart of the Jews, who would not believe in~
Him either for prophesying or for miracles.

[Responsory8]
R. When the wise men saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
* And when they were come into the house, they found the young Child with Mary~
His Mother, and fell down and worshipped Him; and when they had opened their~
treasures, they presented unto Him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.
V. The star which the wise men had seen in the East, went before them, till it~
came and stood over where the young Child was.
R. And when they were come into the house, they found the young Child with Mary~
His Mother, and fell down and worshipped Him.
&Gloria
R. And when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto Him gifts; gold,~
and frankincense, and myrrh.

[Lectio9]
All things which He had made, bore witness that their Maker was come. Let me~
reckon them after the manner of men. The heavens knew that He was God, and sent a~
star to shine over where He lay. The sea knew it, and bore Him up when He walked~
upon it. The earth knew it, and quaked when He died. The sun knew it, and was~
darkened. The rocks and walls knew it, and rent at the hour of His death. Hell~
knew it, and gave up the dead that were in it. And yet up to this very hour the~
hearts of the unbelieving Jews will not acknowledge that He to Whom all nature~
testified is their God, and, being more hardened than the rocks, refuse to be~
rent by repentance.
