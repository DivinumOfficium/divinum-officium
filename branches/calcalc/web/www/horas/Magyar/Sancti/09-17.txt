[Hymnus Vespera]
{:H-Isteconfessor:}v. Im a hitvallĂł, kit a fĂśld hatĂĄrĂĄn

JĂĄmbor, jĂłzan volt, okos ĂŠs szemĂŠrmes.

MĂ­g embertestĂŠt eleven tĂźzĂŠvel
Lakta a lĂŠlek.

IstentĂ´l immĂĄr, magas ĂŠrdemĂŠĂŠrt,
Sok szegĂŠny testnek, kit igĂĄz betegsĂŠg.

VisszakĂśnyĂśrgĂŠ.

[Lectio1]
From the letter of St Paul to the Galatians.
!Gal 5:25-26; 6:1-6
25 Ha a LĂŠlek szerint ĂŠlĂźnk, viselkedjĂźnk is a LĂŠleknek megfelelĂľen.
26 Ne tĂśrtessĂźnk kihĂ­vĂłan s egymĂĄsra irigykedve hiĂş dicsĂľsĂŠg utĂĄn.
1 TestvĂŠrek, ha valakit botlĂĄson ĂŠrtek, ti akik lelkiek vagytok, intsĂŠtek meg a~
szelĂ­dsĂŠg szellemĂŠben. De Ăźgyelj, hogy magad kĂ­sĂŠrtĂŠsbe ne essĂŠl!
2 HordozzĂĄtok egymĂĄs terhĂŠt, Ă­gy teljesĂ­titek Krisztus tĂśrvĂŠnyĂŠt.
3 Aki bekĂŠpzeli magĂĄnak, hogy valaki, holott semmi, ĂśnmagĂĄt ĂĄltatja.
4 Mindenki a sajĂĄt tetteit tegye mĂŠrlegre, dicsekvĂŠsĂŠt pedig tartsa meg magĂĄnak,~
ne tĂĄrja mĂĄsok elĂŠ.
5 Hiszen mindenkinek a maga terhĂŠt kell hordoznia.
6 Akit a (keresztĂŠny) igazsĂĄgokra tanĂ­tanak, engedjen rĂŠszt tanĂ­tĂłjĂĄnak minden~
javĂĄbĂłl.

[Lectio2]
!Gal 6:7-13
7 Ne ĂĄltassĂĄtok magatokat, Isten nem hagy magĂĄbĂłl gĂşnyt Ăťzni. Amit az ember vet,~
azt is aratja.
8 Aki tehĂĄt test szerint vet, testĂŠbĂľl is arat majd romlĂĄst. Aki ellenben a~
lĂŠlek szerint vet, lelkĂŠbĂľl arat ĂśrĂśk ĂŠletet.
9 Ne fĂĄradjunk bele tenni a jĂłt, mert ha kitartunk, annak idejĂŠn aratni is~
fogunk.
10 AmĂ­g tehĂĄt idĂľnk van, tegyĂźnk jĂłt mindenkivel, fĂľkĂŠppen hittestvĂŠreinkkel.
11 NĂŠzzĂŠtek, mekkora betĂťkkel Ă­rok nektek a sajĂĄt kezemmel!
12 Akik test szerint akarnak tetszeni, kĂśrĂźlmetĂŠlkedĂŠsre kĂŠnyszerĂ­tenek titeket,~
csak azĂŠrt, hogy Krisztus keresztjĂŠĂŠrt ne szenvedjenek ĂźldĂśzĂŠst.
13 Hiszen maguk a kĂśrĂźlmetĂŠltek sem tartjĂĄk meg a tĂśrvĂŠnyt. CsupĂĄn azĂŠrt~
kĂ­vĂĄnjĂĄk a ti kĂśrĂźlmetĂŠlĂŠseteket, hogy testetekkel dicsekedhessenek.

[Lectio3]
!Gal 6:14-18
14 Ăn azonban nem akarok mĂĄssal dicsekedni, mint Urunk, JĂŠzus Krisztus~
keresztjĂŠvel. Ăltala keresztre szegeztĂŠk nekem a vilĂĄgot, ĂŠs engem is a~
vilĂĄgnak.
15 Mert sem a kĂśrĂźlmetĂŠltsĂŠg nem ĂŠr semmit, sem a kĂśrĂźlmetĂŠletlensĂŠg, hanem csak~
az Ăşj teremtmĂŠny.
16 BĂŠke ĂŠs irgalom mindazoknak, akik ezt a szabĂĄlyt kĂśvetik, Isten (igaz)~
IzraelĂŠnek!
17 EzutĂĄn senki ne okozzon kellemetlensĂŠget nekem, mert JĂŠzus jegyeit viselem~
testemen.
18 A mi Urunk, JĂŠzus Krisztus kegyelme legyen lelketekkel, testvĂŠrek! Amen.

[Lectio4]
From the Readings upon the Life of St Francis, composed by St Buona- Ventura,~
Cardinal Bishop (of Albano.)
!Chapter 13.
Francis being indeed a faithful servant and minister of Christ, about the space~
of two years before he gave back his spirit to heaven, withdrew himself into an~
high mountain apart, even that mountain which is called Mount Alverno, and began~
to fast for forty days to the honour of the Archangel Michael. To think of the~
things above gave him sweeter comfort than beforetime he was wont, and the hot~
longing for heaven was kindled in him, so that he began to feel that the gifts~
from above were poured forth upon him in such fulness as he had never felt~
before. The burning of his desire made his heart rise towards God like the heart~
of a seraph, and his tender answering love yearned to be changed into the~
likeness of Him Who hath so loved us that He was content to bear the Cross. And~
it was so that one morning early, about the time of the Feast of the Exaltation~
of the Holy Cross, he was praying upon the side of the mountain, and there~
appeared unto him as it had been one of the Seraphim, having six wings, glorious~
and fiery, flying to him from heaven. It came therefore very swiftly, and stood~
in the air, hard by the man of God. He beheld then the appearance thereof that~
it was not winged only, but crucified also. His hands and feet were stretched~
forth and nailed to a Cross. Twain of his wings were lifted up and joined one to~
the other over his head, and twain were stretched forth to fly withal, and with~
twain he wrapped around his body. When Francis saw it, he was sore amazed, and~
his soul was.filled with sorrow and gladness, for the eyes of him that appeared~
were full of strange love and tenderness, so that he conceived great rejoicing~
thereat, but the nailing to the Cross was so exceedingly dreadful, that as he~
saw it, a sword of sorrow pierced his soul.

[Lectio5]
Then He Whom he beheld with his bodily eyes, began to speak silently unto him in~
his heart, and he understood that albeit the deathless Seraphim cannot suffer or~
faint, this vision was nevertheless therefore set before him, that he might know~
that as a friend of Christ he was to be all changed into the likeness of Christ~
Jesus crucified, not by the martyrdom of the body, but by the fervour of the~
soul. Then they held together some sweet converse, as of a man with his friend,~
and the vision passed from him, but his heart was kindled inwardly with the fire~
of the Seraphim, and his body was outwardly changed into the likeness of Him Who~
was crucified, even as wax is softened by the fire and taketh the impression of~
the seal. From thenceforth there were in his hands and feet the marks of the~
nails. The heads of the nails were seen in the palms of his hands and on the~
insteps of his feet, and the points came out on the backs of his hands and the~
soles of his feet. In his right side also was a long raw wound, as though he had~
been pierced with a spear, from which wound his holy blood oftentimes ran and~
stained his shirt and breeches.

[Lectio6]
Thereafter Francis was a newcreature, famous for a new and awful sign. The holy~
marks of the Lord Jesus, whereon living man for twelve centuries had not been~
allowed to look, were his adornment. He came down from the mount bearing in~
himself the form of Jesus Crucified, not pourtrayed upon tables of stone or wood~
by the hand of any earthly craftsman, but drawn upon his flesh by the finger of~
the living God. The dying Seraph knew well that it is good to keep close the~
secret of a king, (Tobit xii. 7,) and knowing the secret of his King, he strove~
as far as in him lay to keep the sacred marks hidden from men. Nevertheless,~
forasmuch as it is the will of the Lord God for His Own glory to make manifest~
the greatness of His Own works, He openly showed forth divers wonders through~
these wounds which He had Himself made in secret, so that the hidden and~
wondrous power of the marks might become known by the fame of the miracles. The~
foregoing marvellous but thoroughly witnessed facts, which were already spoken~
of in Papal documents with especial praise and joy, were made, by the pleasure~
of Pope Benedict XL, the subject of a yearly memorial, which was afterwards~
extended by Paul V. to the whole Church, in the hope of fanning in the hearts of~
the faithful the love of Christ Crucified.

Francis, by a singular privilege, was adorned with the holy marks of the Lord Jesus, whereon living man for twelve centuries had not been allowed to look. He came down from the mount bearing in himself the form of Jesus Crucified, not pourtrayed upon tables of stone or wood by the hand of any earthly craftsman, but drawn upon his flesh by the finger of the living God.
