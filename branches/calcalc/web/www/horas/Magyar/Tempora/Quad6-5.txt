Olvasmány Jeremiás próféta siralmainak könyvéből
!Lam 1:1-5
!Lam 2:8-11
8 Elhatározta az Úr, hogy lerombolja Sion leányának falait. Kifeszítette a mérőzsinórt, s nem vonta vissza a kezét, amíg teljesen el nem pusztította. Gyászba borult a sánc és a kőfal; romokban hever mind a kettő.
9 Kapui a földbe süllyedtek; leverte és összetörte zárait. Királya és fejedelmei a pogányok közt vannak, megszűnt a törvény. Prófétái nem kapnak többé látomást az Úrtól.
10 A földön ülnek szótlanul Sion leányának vénei. Hamut szórtak a fejükre, és szőrzsákba öltöztek. Mélyen lehorgasztották a fejüket Jeruzsálem hajadon leányai.
11 Szemem elsorvadt a sírástól, a bensőm megrendült. Megfordult a szívem bennem népem leányának romlása miatt. Mert apró gyerekek és csecsemők pusztulnak el a város terein.
r. Jerusalem, Jerusalem, térj meg Uradhoz Istenedhez.

[Responsory1]
R. All my friends abandoned me, those who lie win over me, whom I loved most, turned against me
* Crude enemies with terrible eyes, gave me vinegar to drink
V. They cast me out to the wicked ones, they had no pity for my soul
R. Crude enemies with terrible eyes, gave me vinegar to drink

[Lectio2]
!Lam 2:12-15
12 Azt kérdezgették anyjuktól, hogy hol a kenyér és a bor, amikor elpusztultak, mint a sebesültek a város terein, és amikor kilehelték lelküket anyjuk ölében.
13 Mihez hasonlítsalak, mivel vesselek össze, Jeruzsálem leánya? Ki tudna megvigasztalni, Sionnak szűz leánya? Mert nagy, mint a tenger, a fájdalmad. Ki gyógyíthatna meg?
14 Amit prófétáid jövendöltek neked, az csalárdság volt és balgaság. Soha nem tárták fel vétkedet, hogy indítsanak megtérésre, Hamis látomásokkal hitegettek, becsaptak és félrevezettek.
15 Akiknek erre visz az útjuk, összecsapják a kezüket, amikor meglátnak. Felszisszennek, fejüket csóválják Jeruzsálem leánya miatt: Ezzé lett a szépek szépe, az egész földnek ékessége?
r. Jerusalem, Jerusalem, térj meg Uradhoz Istenedhez.

[Responsory2]
R. the veil of the temple was rent
* The earth trembled: the robber from the cross cried:: Remember me O Lord, when you coming to your Kingdon.
V. The rocks were rent, and the graves were opened: and many bodies of the saints that had slept arose,
R. The earth trembled: the robber from the cross cried:: Remember me O Lord, when you coming to your Kingdon.

!Lam 3:1-9
1 Olyan ember vagyok, aki átéltem a nyomorúságot haragjának vesszeje alatt.
2 A sötétségbe vitt és vezetett, nem a világosságba.
3 Egyedül ellenem emeli föl a kezét újra meg újra, egész nap.
4 Elsorvasztotta húsomat és bőrömet, összetörte csontjaimat.
5 Körülsáncolt és körülvett engem epével és gyötrelemmel.
6 A sötétségben adott nekem lakást a rég megholtak között.
7 Fallal vett körül, nem mehetek ki, súlyos bilincsbe vert.
8 Ha kiáltok és könyörgök, kizárja imádságomat.
9 Faragott kövekkel zárta el utamat, eltorlaszolta ösvényemet.
r. Jerusalem, Jerusalem, térj meg Uradhoz Istenedhez.

[Responsory3]
R. I planted thee as a chosen vineyard
* How then art thou turned unto me in bitterness, that crucified me and let Barabbam go?
V. I fenced you in a garden, and picked the stones out of it, and built a tower
R. How then art thou turned unto me in bitterness, that crufified me and let Barabbam go?
&Gloria
R. I planted thee as a chosen vineyard * How then art thou turned unto me in bitterness, that crufified me and let Barabbam go?

[Lectio4]
From the Treatise of St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo,) Upon the Psalms
!On Psalm lxiii. 2.
Thou hast hidden me from the secret counsel of the wicked, from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity. Now let us fix our eyes upon our Head. Many martyrs have. suffered such things as He suffered, but God's hiding of His suffering ser; vants is not so well seen in the Martyrs, as it is in the Captain of the Martyrs. And it is in Him that we best see how it fared with them. He was hidden from the secret counsel of the wicked; hidden by God, being Himself God; hidden, as touching the Manhood, by God the Son, and the very Manhood, Which is taken into God the Son; because He is the Son of man, and He is the Son of; God Son of God, as being in the form of God; Son of man, as having taken upon Him the form of a servant, (Phil. ii. 6, 7,) Whose life no man taketh from Him, but Who layeth it down of Himself. He hath power to lay it down, and He hath power to take it again, (John x. 18.) What then was all that they which hated Him could do? They could kill the Body, but they were not able to kill the Soul. Consider this very earnestly. It had been a small thing for the Lord to preach to the Martyrs by His word, if He had not also nerved them by His example.

[Responsory4]
R. Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves, for to take Me?
* I sat daily with you, teaching in the Temple, and ye laid no hold on Me; and, now when ye have scourged Me, ye lead Me away to crucify Me!
V. And when they had laid hands on Jesus, and taken Him, He said unto them :
R. I sat daily with you, teaching in the Temple, and ye laid no hold on Me; and now, when ye have scourged Me, ye lead Me away to crucify Me!

[Lectio5]
We know what secret counsel was that of the wicked Jews, and what insurrection was that of the workers of iniquity. Of what iniquity were they the workers? The murder of our Lord Jesus Christ. Many good works, saith He, have I showed you for which of those works go ye about to kill Me? He had borne with all their weaknesses : He had healed all their diseases : He had preached unto them the kingdom of heaven : He had discovered to them their iniquities, that they might rather hate them, than the Physician That came to cure them. And now at last, without gratitude for all the tenderness of His healing love, like men raging in an high delirium, throwing themselves madly on the Physician, Who had come to cure them, they took counsel together how they might kill Him, as if to see if He were a Man and could die, or Something more than a man, and That would not let Himself die. In the Wisdom of Solomon we recognize their words, (ii. 18, 19, 20,) Let us condemn Him with a shameful death Let us examine Him; for, by His own saying, He shall be respected. If He be the Son of God, let Him help Him.

[Responsory5]
R. The Jews crucified Jesus : and there was darkness (over all the land, unto the ninth hour) : and about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, (saying) : My God, (My God,) why hast Thou forsaken Me?
* And He bowed His Head, and gave up the Ghost.
V. When Jesus had cried with a loud voice, He said : Father, into thy hands I commend My Spirit.
R. And He bowed His Head, and gave up the Ghost.

[Lectio6]
They whet heir tongue like a sword. The Jews cannot say : We did not murder Christ albeit they gave Him over to Pilate His judge, that they themselves might seem free of His death. For when! Pilate said unto them, Take ye Him: and kill Him, they answered, It; is not lawful for us to put any man to death. They could throw the' blame of their sin upon a human judge : but did they deceive God, the Great Judge? In that which Pilate; did, he was their accomplice, but in comparison with them, he had far the lesser sin. (John xix. 11.) Pilate' strove as far as he could, to deliver Him out of their hands; for the which reason also he scourged Him, (John xix. 1,) and brought Him forth to, them He scourged not the Lord for cruelty's sake, but in the hope that; he might so slake their wild thirst for blood: that, perchance, even they might be touched with compassion, and cease to lust for His death, when they saw What He was after the flag's elation. Even this effort he made.! But when Pilate saw that he could! not prevail, but that rather a tumult was made, (Matth. xxvii. 24,) ye know how that he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying: I am innocent of the i Blood of this Just Person. And yet he delivered Him to be crucified! But if he were guilty who did it against his will, were they innocent; who goaded him on to it? No. Pilate gave sentence against Him. and commanded Him to be crucified. But ye, O ye Jews, ye also are His murderers! Wherewith? With your tongue, whetted like a sword. And when? But when ye cried, Crucify Him! Crucify Him! 

[Responsory6]
R. I have given the dearly-beloved o My soul into the hand of her enemies and Mine heritage is become unto Me as a lion in the forest; the enemy crieth out against Me, saying : Assemble yourselves together, hasten to devour Him : they have made My portion a desolate wilderness, and the whole land mourneth unto Me :
* Because there is none found that will know Me, nor do well.
V. There be risen up against me such as breathe out cruelty, and they have not spared my soul.
R. Because there is none found that will know Me, nor do well.
&Gloria

Szent Pál Apostol zsidókhoz írott leveléből
!Heb 4:11-15
11 Törekedjünk tehát rá, hogy bejussunk nyugalmának ebbe az (országába), nehogy valaki éppúgy elessék, mint előbb a hitetlenség példáján láttuk.
12 Az Isten szava ugyanis eleven, átható és minden kétélű kardnál élesebb, behatol a lélek és szellem, az íz és a velő gyökeréig, megítéli a szív gondolatait és érzéseit.
13 Semmilyen teremtett dolog nem marad előtte rejtve; minden föl van fedve és nyitva van az előtt, akinek számadással tartozunk.
14 Mivel tehát olyan kiváló főpapunk van, aki áthatolt az egeken, Jézus, az Isten Fia, legyünk állhatatosak a hitvallásban.
15 Főpapunk ugyanis nem olyan, hogy ne tudna együttérezni gyöngeségeinkkel, hanem olyan, aki hozzánk hasonlóan mindenben kísértést szenvedett, a bűntől azonban ment maradt.

[Responsory7]
R.They gave me to the hand of the ungodly, put me among the wicked men, did nor spared my soul
* And they stood like giants against me
V. strangers have risen up against me; and the mighty have sought after my soul
R. And they stood like giants against me

[Lectio8]
!Heb 4:16: 5:1-3
1 Óvakodjunk ezért attól, hogy közületek bárki úgy vélekedjen, még késlekedhet bemenni nyugalmába, mert még érvényben van az ígéret.
2 Hozzánk éppúgy eljutott az üdvösség örömhíre, mint őhozzájuk; ám nekik nem vált hasznukra a tanítás, mert nem csatlakoztak azokhoz, akik hittel hallgatták.
3 Nyugalma országába ugyanis csak akkor jutunk el, ha hívők vagyunk. Mert ezt mondta: Megesküdtem hát haragomban, hogy nyugalmamba be nem mennek.

[Responsory8]
R. Jesus were given to the hand of the chief prists and the elders of the nation.
* Peter followed him afar off, that he might see the end.
V. led him to Caiphas the high priest, where the scribes and the ancients were assembled
R. Peter followed him afar off, that he might see the end.

[Lectio9]
!Heb 5:4-10
4 A tisztséget magától senki sem vállalhatja, csak akit az Isten meghív, mint Áront.
5 Így Krisztus sem önmagát emelte főpapi méltóságra, hanem az, aki így szólt hozzá: "A Fiam vagy, ma szültelek."
6 Másutt meg ezt mondja: "Pap vagy mindörökké Melkizedek rendje szerint."
7 Földi életében hangosan kiáltozva, könnyek között imádkozott, s könyörgött ahhoz, aki meg tudta menteni a haláltól, és hódolatáért meghallgatásra talált.
8 Annak ellenére, hogy ő volt a Fiú, a szenvedésből engedelmességet tanult.
9 Műve befejeztével pedig örök üdvösséget szerzett azoknak, akik engedelmeskednek neki,
10 mert az Isten őt hirdette ki főpapnak, Melkizedek rendje szerint.

[Responsory9]
R. My sight is dim from the tears, can not see who would comfort me; see all ye people
* If there be any sorrow like to my sorrow
V. O all ye that pass by the way, attend, and see
R. If there be any sorrow like to my sorrow
&Gloria
R. My sight is dim from the tears, can not see who would comfort me; see all ye people * If there be any sorrow like to my sorrow
