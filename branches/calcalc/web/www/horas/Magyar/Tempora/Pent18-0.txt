[Lectio7]
Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 9:1-8
At that time Jesus entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into His own~
city. And so on.
_
Homily by St Peter Chrysologus, Archbishop (of Ravenna.)
!Sermon 50.
This day's reading hath shown us an instance of how Christ, in those things~
which He did as Man, worked deep works of God, and by things which were seen~
wrought things which were not seen. The Evangelist saith Jesus " entered into a~
ship, and passed over, and came into His Own city." Was not This He Who had once~
parted the waves hither and thither, and made the dry ground appear at the~
bottom of the sea, so that His people Israel passed dry-shod between masses of~
water standing still, as through an hollow glen in a mountain Was not This He~
Who made the depths of the sea solid under the feet of Peter, so that the watery~
path offered a firm way for human footsteps

[Lectio8]
Therefore then denied He unto Himself a like service from the sea, but crossed~
over that narrow lake at the cost of a voyage on shipboard " He entered into a~
ship, and passed over." What wonder, my brethren Christ came to take our~
weakness upon Him, that He might n make us partakers of His strength to seek~
the things of men, that He might give to men the things of God to receive~
insults, that He might bestow honours to bear weariness, that He might grant~
rest for the physician that is himself beset by no frailties, knoweth not how~
to treat the frailties of others, nor he that is not weak with the weak, how to~
make the weak strong.

[Lectio9]
Therefore, if Christ had abode still in His strength, He had in no wise been a~
fellow of men if in Him Flesh had not run the way of flesh, then had it been~
idle for Him to have taken Flesh at all. " He entered into a ship, and passed~
over, and came into His Own city." The Lord, the Maker of the world, and of all~
things that are therein, having been pleased for our sakes to prison Himself in~
our flesh, began to have an human home, and to be a citizen of a Jewish city~
Himself the Father of all, to have parents and all, that His love might invite,~
His charity draw, His tenderness bind, His gentleness persuade them whom His~
Kingship had scared, His awfulness scattered, and His power terrified out of His~
dominion.

The Lord said unto the sick * of. the palsy Son, be of good cheer thy sins~
be forgiven thee.

[Versum 2]
V. The Lord reigneth He is clothed with majesty.
R. The Lord is clothed with strength, and hath girded Himself with power.

[Ant 3]
And immediately, he that had been sick of the palsy arose, * and took up his bed~
whereon he lay, glorifying God and all the people, when they saw it, gave~
praise to God.

[Versum 3]
V. Let my prayer, O Lord, be set forth.
R. As incense before thee.
