[Ant 1]
Ye mountains of Gilboa, * let there be no dew, neither let there be rain upon~
you; for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul,~
as though he had not been anointed with oil. How are the mighty fallen in the~
midst of the battle! Jonathan is slain upon the high places Saul and Jonathan~
were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not~
divided.

[Versum 1]
V. Let the evening prayer ascend unto thee, O Lord.
R. And let there descend upon us thy mercy.

[Oratio]
O God, Who hast prepared for them that love thee such good things as pass man's~
understanding; pour into our hearts such love toward thee, that we, loving thee~
in all things and above all things, may obtain thy promises, which exceed all~
that we can desire.

Olvasmány Sámuel második könyvébõl
!2 Sam 1:1-4
1 Saul halála után, az amalekiták elleni csatából hazatérve Dávid két napig~
Ciklagban maradt.
2 A harmadik nap egy ember érkezett Saul táborából. A ruhája meg volt szaggatva~
és hamu volt a fején. Amikor Dávid elé ért, a földre vetette magát és leborult~
elõtte.
3 Dávid megkérdezte: "Honnét jössz?" "Izrael táborából menekültem" - felelte.
4 "Mi történt? - kérdezte Dávid. - Beszéld el nekem!" "A nép elmenekült a~
csatából - válaszolta -, s az emberek közül sokan elestek. Saul és fia, Jonatán~
is halott!"

[Responsory1]
R. Prepare your hearts unto the Lord, and serve Him Only
* And He will deliver you out of the hand of your enemies.
V. Return unto Him with all your hearts, and put away the strange gods from~
among you.
R. And He will deliver you out of the hand of your enemies.

[Lectio2]
!2 Sam 1:5-10
5 Ekkor Dávid megkérdezte a legényt, aki a hírt hozta neki: "Hogy tudtad meg,~
hogy Saul és fia, Jonatán is halott?"
6 A legény, aki a hírt hozta, ezt felelte: "Épp Gilboa hegyére tévedtem, s~
láttam, amint Saul lándzsája fölé hajolt - nyomában a kocsik és lovasok.
7 Amikor megfordult és észrevett, megszólított:
8 "Ki vagy?" "Egy amalekita" - válaszoltam.
9 Erre megparancsolta: "Gyere ide és add meg a kegyelemdöfést, mert bár kínlódom,~
még teljesen bennem van az élet."
10 Odamentem hát és megadtam neki a kegyelemdöfést, mert tudtam, hogy nem éli~
túl bukását. Aztán levettem a fejérõl a koronát meg a karjáról a karperecet és~
elhoztam ide, uramnak."

[Responsory2]
R. God, Which heareth all, even He sent His Angel, and took me from keeping my~
father's sheep, and
* Anointed me with the oil of His mercy.
V. The Lord That delivered me out of the mouth of the lion, and out of the paw~
of the bear
R. And anointed me with the oil of His mercy.

[Lectio3]
!2 Sam 1:11-15
11 Erre Dávid fogta a ruháját, és megszaggatta. Ugyanígy az emberei is, akik~
vele voltak, mind.
12 Jajgattak és sírtak, és egészen estig böjtöltek Saulért és fiáért, Jonatánért,~
az Úr népéért és Izrael házáért, amiért elhullottak a kard élén.
13 Dávid ezután megkérdezte a legénytõl, aki a hírt hozta neki: "Hova való~
vagy?" "Egy amalekitának, egy betelepült jövevénynek vagyok a fia" - válaszolta.
14 Erre Dávid azt mondta: "Hát nem féltél kinyújtani a kezed és megölni az Úr~
fölkentjét?"
15 Aztán Dávid odaszólította egyik legényét, és megparancsolta neki: "Gyere ide~
és szúrd le!" Az leszúrta, úgyhogy meghalt.

[Responsory3]
R. The Lord That delivered me out of the mouth of the lion, and out of the paw~
of the bear
* He will deliver me out of the hand of mine enemies.
V. God hath sent forth His mercy and His truth, and delivered my soul from among~
the lion's whelps.
R. He will deliver me out of the hand of mine enemies.
&Gloria
R. He will deliver me out of the hand of mine enemies.

[Lectio4]
From the Book of Moral (Reflections upon Job), written by Pope St Gregory the~
Great.
!Bk. iv. ch. 3, 4.
Thus was it that David, who rewarded no evil to them that did evil to him (Ps.~
vii. 5), when Saul and Jonathan had fallen in battle, cursed the mountains of~
Gilboa, saying Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there~
be rain upon you, nor fields of offerings; for there the shield of the mighty is~
vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with~
oil Why was it that Jeremiah, when he saw that his preaching was thrown away~
upon his hearers, cursed and said Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my~
father, saying,A man-child is born unto thee? (xx. 15.)

[Responsory4]
R. Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.
* Because the hand of the Lord was with him, he smote the Philistine, and took~
away the reproach from Israel.
V. Is not this David? Did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying~
Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
R. Because the hand of the Lord was with him, he smote the Philistine, and took~
away the reproach from Israel.

[Lectio5]
He had the mountains of Gilboa to do with the death of Saul, that they should be~
condemned to have dew fall on them no more, neither rain, but should wither away,~
barren of the green glory of the springtime? But this word Gilboa signified~
bubbling fountain, and the death of Saul the Anointed of God is a type of the~
death of our Anointed Mediator. Thus we find in the mountains of Gilboa no unfit~
image of the proud hearts of the Jews, which had their spring in earthly desires,~
and took part in the death of the Anointed Saviour. And since among them their~
Anointed Monarch met His death, the dew of grace is upon them no more.

[Responsory5]
R. Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain upon~
you
* For there are the mighty of Israel fallen
V. All ye mountains that stand round about, the Lord look upon you but let Him~
pass by Gilboa
R. For there are the mighty of Israel fallen

[Lectio6]
And well is it said of them Let there be upon you no fields of offerings. The~
proud minds of the Hebrews bear yet no offering. Since the coming of their~
Redeemer, the most part of them remain still without belief in Him, and refuse~
to follow the promise of their ancient faith. The Holy Church hath borne for her~
first-born, holy unto the Lord, a multitude of the Gentiles, and will, but in~
the end of the world, embrace such Jews as she then shall find, and present them~
as the last gatherings of her harvest.

[Responsory6]
R. Thus saith the Lord I took thee out of thy father's house, and appointed~
thee to be ruler over My people, over Israel.
* And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, to establish thy kingdom for~
ever.
V. And I have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that~
are in the earth and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies.
R. And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, to establish thy kingdom for~
ever.
&Gloria
R. And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, to establish thy kingdom for~
ever.

Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kõnyvébõl
!Matt 5:20-24
Ezért mondom nektek: ha igazságotok nem múlja felül az írástudókét és a~
farizeusokét, nem juttok be a mennyek országába. Hallottátok, hogy a régiek ezt a~
parancsot kapták: Ne ölj! Aki öl, állítsák a törvényszék elé. És így tovább
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop of Hippo.
!Bk. i. on the Lord's Sermon on the Mount, ch. 9.
Thou shalt not kill, is of the righteousness of the Pharisees; Thou shalt not be~
angry with thy brother without a cause, is of the righteousness of them which~
shall enter into the kingdom of heaven. The least therefore is: Thou shalt not~
kill, and whosoever shall break this commandment, he shall be called the least~
in the kingdom of heaven, (v. 19.) But whosoever shall do it, and not kill, he~
is not therefore great, and meet for the kingdom of heaven; albeit, he hath~
risen a step; but he will have gotten farther, if he be not angry with his~
brother without a cause, which, if he do, he will be the farther off from~
manslaughter. Wherefore, He Which teacheth us that we are not to be angry~
without a cause, destroyeth not the law, Thou shalt not kill, but rather~
fulfilleth and increaseth it, making us not only to be free of the sin of~
outward killing, but also clean of anger within.

[Responsory7]
@Tempora/Pent01-3:Responsory1

[Lectio8]
On sins of this kind there are divers steps. First, there is the swelling~
feeling of anger. When this feeling appeareth in a man's heart, he keepeth it.~
Then the inward disturbance wringeth forth words of indignation, not themselves~
meaning aught, but showing the trouble of him who is provoked. And this is~
something more than anger kept covered under silence. Next, this audible~
outburst of indignation may contain direct and open reviling of him who hath~
roused it. And it cannot be doubted that this is something more than an empty~
cry of anger.

[Responsory8]
@Tempora/Pent01-0:Responsory8

[Lectio9]
Behold here the three degrees of guilt open respectively to the judgment, to the~
council, and to hellfire. In the judgment, there is still place for defence. In~
the council, albeit this also is in a sense a judgment, yet we may suppose this~
distinction from the judgment proper, that the council pronounceth sentence, not~
as the result of a trial whereat the accused is present, but as the result of a~
consultation among the judges, to what punishment he is to be sentenced of whom~
it is already established that he is guilty. When we get to hell-fire, there~
remaineth no longer any doubt about condemnation, as in the judgment, and no~
longer any doubt about sentence, as in the council. In hellfire the condemnation~
and the pain of him that is condemned are alike certain.
&teDeum

[Ant 2]
Ye have heard that it was said * by them of old time Thou shalt not kill; and~
whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment.

[Versum 2]
V. The Lord reigneth; He is clothed with majesty.
R. The Lord is clothed with strength, and hath girded Himself with power.

[Ant 3]
If thou bring thy gift to the Altar, * and there rememberest that thy brother~
hath aught against thee, leave there thy gift before the Altar, and go thy way;~
first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. Alleluia.

[Versum 3]
V. Let my prayer, O Lord, be set forth.
R. As incense before thee.
