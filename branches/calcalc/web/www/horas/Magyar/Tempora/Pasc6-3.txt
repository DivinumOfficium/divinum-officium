Olvasmány szent János apostol második leveléből
!2 John 1:1-5
1 Én, "az Öreg", a kiválasztott Úrnőnek és gyermekeinek, akiket az Igazságban szeretek, 
2 de nemcsak én, hanem mindenki, aki megismerte az Igazságot, amely bennünk van, és velünk lesz örökre. 
3 Legyen velünk az Atyaistennek és Jézus Krisztusnak, az Atya Fiának kegyelme, irgalma és békéje, igazságban és szeretetben! 
4 Igen örültem, hogy gyermekeid közt olyanokat találtam, akik az Igazságban élnek az Atyától kapott parancs szerint. 
5 És most kérlek, Úrnő, nem mintha új parancsról írnék neked, hisz ez kezdet óta parancsunk: Szeressük egymást!

!2 John 1:6-9
6 Ez a szeretet azt jelenti, hogy parancsai szerint éljünk. Ez hát a parancs, mint ahogy kezdettől fogva hallottátok, hogy éljetek szeretetben. 
7 Mert sok csaló fellépett a világban, aki nem vallja, hogy Jézus Krisztus testben jött el. Az ilyen csaló és antikrisztus. 
8 Vigyázzatok magatokra, nehogy elveszítsétek, amit már megszereztetek, hanem teljes bért kapjatok. 
9 Aki ezen túlmegy, és nem marad meg Krisztus tanításában, nem mondhatja magáénak az Istent. De aki kitart a tanításban, az Atyát is, a Fiút is magáénak mondhatja.

10 Ha valaki nem ezzel a tanítással megy hozzátok, még csak ne is köszönjetek neki. 
11 Mert aki köszön neki, részes gonosz tetteiben. 
12 Még sok mindenről tudnék írni, de nem akarom papírra és tintára bízni. Remélem, hogy egyszer eljutok hozzátok, és élőszóval mondom el, hogy örömünk teljes legyen. 
13 Üdvözölnek kiválasztott nővéred gyermekei.

From the Sermons of St Gregory, Bishop of Nyssa.
!Discourse on the Lords Ascension.
The very thought of this day's Festival is great enough in itself, but the~
Prophet David hath much inflamed our joyful enthusiasm by the Psalms. This noble~
Prophet hath, as it were, gone out of himself, as though the body were a weight~
duller than his spirit could bear he joineth company with the Powers of heaven,~
and telleth what they said when they went with the Lord heavenward, and cried in~
tones of command to those Angels who work on earth, and by whose heralding the~
Birth of the Incarnate One had been proclaimed "Lift up your gates, O ye~
princes, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall~
come in." (Ps. xxiii. 7, 9.)

[Lectio5]
He, Who containeth all things, is everywhere, but for the sake of them which~
receive Him, He is pleased to make Himself a local Presence which hath bounds.~
Not only did He become a Man among men, but when conversing among Angels, He~
alloweth that title also to be given Him. The gatekeepers therefore ask " Who~
is this King of glory?" and it is answered them that He is " The Lord, strong~
and mighty, the Lord, mighty in battle," the Lord, Whose work it had been to~
fight him who held mankind in bondage, and to " destroy him that had the power~
of death, that is, the devil" (Heb. ii. 14) that now that dark enemy was~
trampled down, and man had had won for him freedom and peace.

[Lectio6]
The keepers run to the gates, and bid the doors unfold, that the Lord may enter~
in, to take again the glory which He had there among them before. But when they~
see Him, clad in the likeness of sinful flesh, (Rom.viii. 3,) they know Him not,~
even Him Who is red in His apparel, because that He hath trodden Alone the~
winepress of human pain, and the blood is sprinkled upon His garments. Therefore~
they cry again to their fellows that bear Him company: "Who is this King of~
glory And they answer them no more "The Lord, strong and mighty, the Lord~
mighty in battle" but "The Lord of hosts the Lord, Whose Own are become the~
kingdoms of the world the Lord, Who hath made Himself the Head of all things the~
Lord, Who hath made all things new (Apoc. xxi. 5.) "He is the King of glory!"

Evangélium szent Márk Evangélista kőnyvéből
!Mark 16:14-20
Azon időben Jézus a tizenegynek jelent meg, amikor egyszer asztalnál ültek. Szemükre vetette hitetlenségüket és keményszívűségüket, hogy nem hittek azoknak, akik feltámadása után látták. És így tovább.

Homily by Pope St Gregory the Great.
!Same as before.
The first question we have to ask is why we read that Angels appeared at the~
time of the Birth of the Lord, but we read not that they appeared in white~
apparel whereas, when the Lord ascended into heaven, it is written that the~
angels which appeared were clad in white. "While they beheld, He was taken up,~
and a cloud received Him out of their sight. And while they looked steadfastly~
toward heaven, as He went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel,"~
~(Acts i. 9,
10.) White raiment is an outward sign of solemn inward joy. That the occasion of~
God-made-Man entering into heaven was a great Festival for Angels, is the reason~
which we see why angels are specially named as robed in white at His Ascension,~
and not at His Birth. At the Birth of the Lord the Godhead was manifested
veiled under the form of a servant, but at His Ascension the Manhood was seen~
exalted and white vestments are more apt to exaltation than humiliation.

[Lectio8]
Therefore were the angels bound to appear in white apparel at the Ascension at~
His Birth He Who thought it not robbery to be equal with God, was seen in the~
form in which He had humbled Himself; at His Ascension the Manhood Which He had~
taken into God was seen glorified. Again, dearly beloved brethren, we must~
remember to-day, how that Christ hath "blotted out the hand-writing that was~
against us," and reversed the sentence which doomed us to corruption. That same~
nature to which it was said, " Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return,"~
that same nature is His Who hath this day ascended up into heaven. It is because~
of this up-lifting of our flesh that blessed Job, by a figure, calleth the Lord a~
bird. The Jews could not understand the Mystery of the Ascension, and in view of~
this their unbelief, blessed Job said mystically "He knew not the path of the~
bird,"

[Lectio9]
The name of a bird is well given to the Lord, Who bodily soared up into heaven.~
And the path of that Bird knoweth no man, who believeth not in the Ascension~
into heaven. It is of this glorious occasion that the Psalmist saith " Who~
hast set thy glory above the heavens," (viii. 2,) and again " God is gone up~
with a shout, and the Lord with the sound of a trumpet," (xlvi. 6.) And yet~
again he saith " Thou hast ascended on high, Thou hast led captivity captive,"~
~(lxvii. 19.) "When Christ ascended up on high, He led captivity captive," (Eph.~
iv. 8,) because by His Own incorruptibility He swallowed up our corruptibility.~
"He gave gifts unto men," because by sending the Spirit from above, He gave "to~
one, the word of wisdom to another, the word of knowledge to another, the~
working of miracles to another, the gifts of healing; to another, divers kinds~
of tongues to another, the interpretation of tongues," (1 Cor. xii.
8-10.)
