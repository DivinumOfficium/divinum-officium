Evangélium szent János Apostol kőnyvéből
!John 9:1-38
Azon időben Jézus látott egy vakon született embert. Tanítványai megkérdezték tőle: Mester, ki vétkezett, ez vagy a szülei, hogy vakon született? És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!44th Tract on John.
Dread and wondrous are all the things which our Lord Jesus Christ did, both His~
works and His words; the works, because He wrought them; the words, because they~
are deep. If, therefore, we consider the meaning of this work of His, we see~
that that man which was blind from his birth was a figure of mankind. This~
spiritual blindness was the consequence of the sin of the first man, from whom~
we all inherit by birth, not death only, but depravity also. For if blindness be~
unbelief, and faith, light, whom, when Christ came, did He find faithful? May,~
the Apostle who had himself been born of the race of which the Prophets came,~
saith We also were by nature children of wrath, even as others. (Eph. ii. 3.)~
And if children of wrath, then children also of vengeance, children of damnation,~
children of hell. And wherefore so by nature, unless it were that the sin of the~
first man had made all his descendants to be born in sin, in that they partook~
of his nature? If, then, our nature bring sin with it, all men, according to the~
spirit, are born blind.

The Lord came; and what did He? He set before us a great mystery. Jesus spat on~
the ground, and made clay of the Spittle for the Word was made flesh. And He~
anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay but yet that man saw not. He~
was anointed, indeed, but yet still he saw not. And He said unto him Go, wash~
in the Pool of Siloam. Now, it was the duty of the Evangelist to impress upon us~
the name of this Pool, and therefore he saith Siloam, which is, by~
interpretation, Sent. Ye, my brethren, know Who is signified where it is~
written: (The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a law-giver from his~
loins, until) He that shall be Sent (cometh.) (Gen. xlix. 10.) Yea, He it is,~
Who, if He had not been sent, we had never been sent loose out of the~
prison-house of sin. The blind man went his way therefore, and washed his eyes~
in that Pool, which is, by interpretation, Sent in other words, he was baptized~
in Christ. When, therefore, he had figuratively been baptized in Him Whom the~
Father hath Sent into the world he came seeing. When he was anointed, he was~
perchance made a figure of a Catechumen.

[Lectio3]
We have heard this great mystery. Ask of a man: Art thou a Christian? He~
answereth thee I am not. Then, if thou ask him: Art thou a pagan then, or a~
Jew? And he still saith unto thee. May and thou say Art thou then a~
Catechumen, though not yet one of the faithful? and he saith Yea, a Catechumen~
then there thou seest a man anointed, but not yet washed. With what hath he been~
anointed? Ask of him, and he will tell thee. Ask of him in Whom he believeth,~
and, being a Catechumen, he will say: In Christ. But, behold, I speak before~
both Faithful and Catechumens. What said I touching the. Spittle and the clay? I~
said for 'the Word was made flesh.' This the Catechumens hear, but it is not~
enough for them to be anointed; they must make haste to the washing, if they~
would have their eyes opened.

[Ant 2]
Rabbi, who did sin, this man, or his parents, * that he was born blind? Jesus~
answered, and said Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents; but that the~
works of God shall be made manifest in him.

[Oratio 2]
O God, Who by mean of fasting dost give unto the righteous the reward of their~
good works, and unto sinners pardon; have mercy upon us, we beseech thee, and~
grant that we, humbly confessing our guiltiness, may so be enabled to obtain thy~
forgiveness.
$Per Dominum.

[Ant 3]
The Man that is called Jesus * made clay of His Spittle, and anointed mine eyes,~
and now I do see.

[Oratio 3]
Let thy merciful ears, O Lord, be open unto the prayers of all them that entreat~
thee, and that Thou mayest grant us ever such things as we ask, teach us ever to~
ask such things as are pleasing in thy sight.
