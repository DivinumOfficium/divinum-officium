Olvasmány szent Pál apostol Kolosszeiekhez írott leveléből
!Col 3:1-7
1 Ha tehát Krisztussal feltámadtatok, keressétek, ami fönt van, ahol Krisztus ül az Isten jobbján.
2 Ami ott fönn van, arra legyen gondotok, ne a földiekre.
3 Hiszen meghaltatok, és életetek Krisztussal el van rejtve az Istenben.
4 Amikor majd Krisztus, a mi életünk megjelenik, vele együtt ti is megjelentek dicsőségesen.
5 Öljétek meg tagjaitokban azt, ami földies: az erkölcstelenséget, a tisztátalanságot, az érzéki vágyakat, a bűnös kívánságokat és a kapzsiságot, ami nem más, mint bálványimádás.
6 Ezek miatt sújtja Isten haragja a hitetlenség fiait.
7 Valaha, amikor még köztük éltetek, ti is ezeket műveltétek.

!Col 3:8-13
8 De most hagyjátok el ezeket: a haragot, a gyűlölködést, a rosszindulatot, az átkozódást és az ocsmány beszédet.
9 Ne hazudjatok egymásnak. Vessétek le a régi embert szokásaival együtt,
10 és öltsétek föl az újat, aki állandóan megújul Teremtőjének képmására a teljes megismerésig.
11 Itt már nincs görög vagy zsidó, körülmetélt vagy körülmetéletlen, barbár vagy szittya, szolga vagy szabad, hanem Krisztus minden mindenben.
12 Mint Istennek szent és kedves választottai, öltsétek magatokra az irgalmasságot, a jóságot, a szelídséget és a türelmet.
13 Viseljétek el egymást, és bocsássatok meg egymásnak, ha valakinek panasza van a másik ellen. Ahogy az Úr megbocsátott nektek, ti is bocsássatok meg egymásnak.

[Responsory2]
R. The angel of the Lord spoke to the women, saying; Do yuo seek Jesus? He is risen:
* Come and see, alleluia, alleluia.
V. Do you seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified? He is risen, he is not here,

!Col 3:14-17
14 Legfőként pedig szeressétek egymást, mert ez a tökéletesség köteléke.
15 S Krisztus békéje töltse be szíveteket, hiszen erre vagytok hivatva, egy testben.
16 Legyetek hálásak, Krisztus tanítása éljen bennetek elevenen, s teljes bölcsességgel tanítsátok és intsétek egymást. Az Istennek énekeljetek hálás szívvel zsoltárt, himnuszt és szent énekeket.
17 Akár mondtok, akár tesztek valamit, tegyetek mindent Urunk Jézus nevében, így adjatok hálát általa Istennek, az Atyának.

From the Sermons of St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!1st Sermon for the Octave of the Passover, being the 157th for the Seasons.
The Feast of this day is the end of the Paschal solemnity, and therefore it is to-day that the Newly-Baptized put off their white garments : but, though they lay aside the outward mark of washing in their raiment, the mark of that washing in their souls remaineth to eternity. Now are the days of the Pass-over, that is, of God's Passing-over our iniquity by His pardon and remission; and therefore our first duty is so to sanctify the mirth of these holy days, that our bodily recreation may be taken without defilement to our spiritual cleanness. Let us strive that our relaxation may be sober and our freedom holy, holding ourselves carefully aloof from anything like excess, drunkenness or lechery. Let us try so to keep in our souls their Lenten cleansing, that if our Fasting hath left us aught yet unwon, we may still be able to seek it.

At discourse concerneth all them which are committed unto my spiritual charge; but, nevertheless, since the first happy week of your Sacramental life draweth this day to a close, I address myself in especial to you who are the new olive-plants of holiness round about the Table of the Lord, (Ps. cxxvii. 4,) to you, who have but a little while been born again of water and the Holy Ghost, (John iii. 5,) to you, O holy generation (1 Pet. ii. 9) to you, O new creation, (Gal. vi. 15,) to you, the excellency of my dignity, (Gen. xlix. 3,) and the fruit of my labour, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and my~
crown, all ye who now stand so fast in the Lord. (Phil. iv. i.) To you I address the words of the Apostle (Rom. xiii. 12.) Behold! the night is past! the day is come! Cast off therefore the works of darkness, and put on the armour of light. Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying : but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ.

We have, saith Peter, (2 Peter i. 19,) a more sure word of Prophecy, whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts. Let your loins therefore be girded about, and your lights burning in your hands, and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding. (Luke xii. 36.) Behold, the days come, whereof the Lord saith, (John xvi. 16, 17, 19,) A little while, and ye shall not see Me, and again a little while and ye shall see Me. No\ is the hour whereof He said (20), Ye shall weep and lament, but the work shall rejoice that is to say, this present life, wherein we walk as strangers and pilgrims, (1 Pet. ii. 11,) far away from Him Who is our Home, this present life is very full of trials. But, saith Jesus, u but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you. (22.)

Evangélium szent János Apostol kőnyvéből
!John 20:19-31
Azon időben amikor beesteledett, még a hét első napján megjelent Jézus a tanítványoknak, ott, ahol együtt voltak, bár a zsidóktól való félelmükben bezárták az ajtót. Belépett, megállt középen és köszöntötte őket: Békesség nektek És így tovább.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great.)
!26th on the Gospels.
When we hear this passage of the Gospel read, a question straightway knocketh at the door of our mind. How was it that the Body of the Risen Lord was a real Body, if It was able to pass through closed doors into the assembly of His disciples? But we ought to know that the works of God are no more wonderful when they can be understood by man's reason, and faith has lost her worth when her subject-matter is the subject-matter of human demonstration. Nevertheless, those very works of our Redeemer which are in themselves impossible to be understood, must be thought over in connection with other of His works, that we may be led to believe in things wonderful, by mean of things more wonderful still. That Body of the Lord, Which came into the assembly of the disciples through closed doors, was the Same, Which at Its birth, had become manifest to the eyes of men by passing out of the cloister of- the Virgin's womb without breaking the seal thereof. What wonder is it if that Body Which had come out of the Virgin's womb, without opening the matrix, albeit It was then on Its way to die, now that It was risen again from the dead and instinct for ever with undying life, what wonder is it, I say, if that Body passed through closed doors?

But since the beholders doubted of the reality of that Body Which they saw, He showed unto them His Hands and His Side, and allowed them to handle that Same~
Flesh Which had just passed through the closed doors. (Luke xxiv. 39.) In this there were two strange things manifested, yea, things which according to our~
understanding are contrary the one to the other. His Risen Body was incorruptible and yet palpable. For whatever can be touched, must needs be subject to corruption; and whatever is not subject to corruption, cannot be touched. But, in a way altogether wonderful and incomprehensible, our Redeemer after His Resurrection revealed Himself in a Body at once palpable and incorruptible : revealed Himself in an incorruptible Body, that we might learn to seek a like glorification; and in a palpable Body, for the strengthening of our faith. He revealed Himself in a Body at once incorruptible and palpable, that He might thereby make manifest the fact that His Risen Body was unaltered in nature, albeit transfigured in glory.

[Lectio9]
Then said Jesus to them again : Peace be unto you. As My Father hath sent Me, even so send I you  that is, as My Father, Who is God, hath sent Me, Who am God, even so do I, Who am Man, send you, who are men. The Father sent the Son, Whom He appointed to be made Man for the redemption of man. Him He willed to send into the world to suffer, albeit He Whom He sent to suffer was the Son of His love. The Lord sendeth His chosen Apostles into the world, not to be happy in~
the world, but, as He had been Himself sent, to suffer. As the Father loveth the Son and yet sendeth Him to suffer, even so doth the Lord love His disciples, albeit He sendeth them into the world, to suffer therein; and therefore it is well said: As My Father hath sent Me, even so send I you  that is, while I send you into the wild storm of persecution, I love you all the same, I love you, yea, I love you with a love like that wherewith the Father loveth Me, Who sent Me into the world to bear agony therein.
