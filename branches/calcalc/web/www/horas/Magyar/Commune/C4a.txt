!Sir 39:1-5
1 Milyen más, aki egész lelkét arra adja, hogy a Magasságbeli törvényét tanulja; kutatja az elődök bölcsességét, s a jövendölésnek szenteli idejét.
2 Neves emberek mondásait őrzi, s behatol a példabeszédek világába.
3 A hasonlatok titkait fürkészi, s a bölcs mondások értelmét keresi.
4 A főemberek közt teljesít szolgálatot, és megjelenik a fejedelmek előtt. Bejárja idegen népek országait, fölfedez jót, s rosszat az emberek között.
5 De szíve azon van, hogy reggeltől Urát s Teremtőjét keresse. Lelkét a Magasságbelihez emeli, imára nyílik ajka, s bűneiért eseng.

[Responsory1]
R. Well done, thou good and faithful servant, thou hast been faithful over a few things. I will make thee ruler over many things
* Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.
V. Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents; behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.
R. Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.

!Sir 39:6-10
6 Ha tetszik Urának, a Hatalmasnak, akkor eltölti az értelem lelkével. Bölcs szavak törnek elő belőle, és imádságában az Urat dicséri.
7 Bölcsen gondolkodik, ért a tudományhoz, s titkok megértésén járatja az eszét.
8 Nyilvánosságra is hozza tanítását, s dicsekszik az Úrnak szent szövetségével.
9 Bölcsességét sokan magasztalják, s az nem is múlik el az idők végéig. Az emlékezete nem enyészik el, késő nemzedékek emlegetik nevét.
10 A népek regélnek nagy bölcsességéről, és a gyülekezet zengi dicséretét.

From the Sermons of St Maximus, Bishop [of Turin.]
!Homilia 59, being the 2nd on St Eusebius of Vercelli.
It is idle to strive to add anything to the praise of our holy and most blessed Father N. whose Feast is this day kept. The beauty of his life oughtnot to be the subject of panegyrics, so much as the object of imitation. The Scripture saith " A wise son is the glory of his father," trulythen will he be honoured by such as, by doing after his en sample,show themselves to be his children for in~~
Christ Jesus hath he begotten us through the Gospel.(1 Cor. iv. 15.)

[Responsory4]
R. I have found David My servant, with My holy oil have I anointed him
* For My hand shall help him.
V. The enemy shall prevail nothing against him, nor the son of wickedness afflict him.
R. For My hand shall help him.

[Lectio5]
Whatsoever, therefore, of virtue and grace there may be in this holy people, all the bright streams thereof do flow from him, as from a most clear fountain. By his manly chastity, by his sternly noble temperance, by the graceful courtesy which marked him, he drew all men's love to God and by his eminent ministry in his Bishoprick he hath left behind him in his disciples, many heirs of his priesthood.

[Responsory5]
R. I have laid help upon one that is mighty, and have exalted one chosen out of My people
* For My hand shall help him.
V. I have found David My servant, with My holy oil have I anointed him.
R. For My hand shall help him.

[Lectio6]
It is very meet and right that upon this day, which is made a joyful day for us because it is the day whereon our blessed Father N., passed away to heaven, I say it is very meet and right that on this day we should sing that verse of the Psalms "The righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance." (cxi. 7.) His memory is rightly honoured among men who is at this present making glad among Angels. The word of God saith "Judge none blessed before his death," (Ecclus. xi. 30,) as though it were said, "Judge him blessed when life is ended, praise him when he is made perfect." For there are two main reasons why it is better to praise a dead man than a living, since, if thou call him holy and worthy after his death, thou dost it when neither canst thou be corrupted by being a flatterer, nor he by being nattered.

[Responsory6]
R. This is he which wrought great wonders before God, and the whole earth is full of his teaching
* May he pray for all people, that their sins may be forgiven unto them
V. This is he which loved not his life in this world, and hath attained unto the kingdom of heaven.
R. May he pray for all people, that their sins may be forgiven unto them
&Gloria
R. May he pray for all people, that their sins may be forgiven unto them

Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 5:13-19
Azon időben így szólt Jézus tanítványaihoz: Ti vagytok a föld sója. Ha a só ízét veszti, ugyan mivel sózzák meg? És így tovább,
_
Homily by St Hilary, Bishop of Poitiers.
!Comment, on Matth. V
"Ye are the salt of the earth. But if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men." There is, I take it, no such thing as salt of the earth. How, then, can the Apostles be called the salt of the earth? But the true meaning of these words will be made plain, when we consider the duty of Apostles, and the nature of salt itself. Now, salt is a compound of the elements of water and fire, out of the which two things in salt there is made one.

[Responsory7]
R. The Lord loved him and beautified him He clothed him with a robe of glory
* And crowned him at the gates of Paradise.
V. The Lord hath put on him the breast-plate of faith, and hath adorned him.
R. And crowned him at the gates of Paradise.

[Lectio8]
This thing, therefore, thus made to serve in divers ways the use of men, doth keep from corruption bodies whereon it is sprinkled, and doth readily yield to~
all the senses the perception of its inborn savour. And thus are the Apostles, seeing that they are the preachers of the kingdom of heaven, and in a certain sense the sowers of the seed of life everlasting, since that Word of God which they scatter hath power to make this mortal put on immortality. Meetly then are they called salt, the savour of whose teaching doth keep sweet the receiver thereof even unto life everlasting.

[Responsory8]
R. In the midst of the congregation did the Lord open his mouth.
* And filled him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding.
V. He made him rich with joy and gladness.
R. And filled him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding.
&Gloria
R. And filled him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding.

[Lectio9]
But the nature of salt is to be ever the same, and unchanging, and, on the other hand, the nature of man hath this weakness, to be changeable. He only is blessed who hath continued even unto the end in all the works which God hath commanded. Therefore dot! the Lord warn them whom He calleth the salt of the earth, that they are behoven to remain strong in that strength which He hath given unto them, lest, becoming themselves savourless, they should be impotent to season others losing the freshness of their own saltness, be unable to stop the corruption round about them and so the Church cast them out of her buttery, and they and those that they should have salted, be together trodden under foot of such as enter in.

Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 5:13-19
At that time : Jesus said unto His disciples : Ye are the salt of the earth. But if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted ? And so on.
_
Homily by St John Chrysostom, Patriarch (of Constantinople.)
!15/A on Matth.
Consider how that the Lord saith : "Ye are the salt of the earth," by the which figure He showeth what a necessary of life is the Gospel. By this figure, He hath us to know that they unto whom He spake have an account to render, not of their own life only, but for the whole world. Not unto two cities, saith the Lord, nor unto ten, nor unto twenty, nor unto one people, as I sent the Prophets, send I you. But I send you unto every land and sea, even unto the whole world, lying groaning, as it is, under the burden of divers sins.

[Lectio82]
These words, " Ye are the salt of the earth," show unto us the whole nature of man as savourless and stinking with the strong corruption of sin. And therefore demandeth He of His Apostles such qualities as are most needful and useful to the furthering the salvation of many. He that is gentle and lowly, tender and just, shutteth not up all these good things in his own heart, but openeth these~
bright fountains that they may gush forth for the use of his neighbour. He whose heart is pure, and who seeketh peace, suffering persecution for the truth's sake, doth still lead a life for the good of the commonwealth.

[Lectio92]
Think not, saith the Lord, that the struggle is easy whereunto ye shall be led, neither shall your reckoning be of light matters. Ye are the salt of the earth. Have ye then salted that which is corrupted? Nay, for it is impossible that that which is once corrupted can be made sound again by the rubbing it with salt. This it is not asked of them to do. But their work is to sprinkle with salt, and to keep fresh thereafter, such things as the Lord hath given over into their charge, and which He Himself hath made new, and freed from all taint, before giving them. To make sound after the corruption of sin, is the work of Christ's power alone ; to preserve from falling away again, is the duty and the toil commanded to the Apostles.
&teDeum
