Lesson from the book of Job
!Job 3:1-5
1  After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed his day,
2  and he said:
3  Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said: A man child is conceived.
4  Let that day be turned into darkness, let not God regard it from above, and let not the light shine upon it.
5  Let darkness, and the shadow of death cover it, let a mist overspread it, and let it be wrapped up in bitterness.

!Job 3:6-10
6  Let a darksome whirlwind seize upon that night, let it not be counted in the days of the year, nor numbered in the months.
7  Let that night be solitary, and not worthy of praise.
8  Let them curse it who curse the day. who are ready to raise up a leviathan:
9  Let the stars be darkened with the mist thereof: let it expect light and not see it, nor the rising of the dawning of the day:
10  Because it shut not up the doors of the womb that bore me, nor took away evils from my eyes.

!Job 3:11-16
11  Why did I not die in the womb, why did I not perish when I came out of the belly?
12  Why received upon the knees? why suckled at the breasts
13  For now I should have been asleep and still, and should have rest in my sleep.
14  With kings and consuls of the earth, who build themselves solitudes:
15  Or with princes, that possess gold, and All their houses with silver:
16  Or as a hidden untimely birth I should not be, or as they that being conceived have not seen the light.
