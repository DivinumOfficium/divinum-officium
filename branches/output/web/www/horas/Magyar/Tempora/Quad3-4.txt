Evangélium szent Lukács könyvéből
!Luke 4:38-44
Azon időben Jézus a zsinagógából kijőve, Simon házába ment. Simon anyósa magas lázban feküdt. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!Bk. iv. on Luke iv.
Behold here how long-suffering is the Lord our Redeemer! Neither moved to anger~
against them, nor sickened at their guilt, nor outraged by their attacks, did He~
leave the Jews' country. Nay, forgetting their iniquity, and mindful only of His~
mercy, He strove to soften their hard and unbelieving hearts, sometimes by His~
teaching, and sometimes by freeing some of them, and sometimes by healing them.~
St Luke doth well to tell us first of the man who was delivered from an unclean~
spirit, and then of the healing of a woman. The Lord indeed came to heal both~
sexes, but that must be healed first which was created first, and then must not~
she be passed by whose first sin arose rather from fickleness of heart than from~
depraved will.

What the Lord began to heal on the Sabbath-day showeth in a figure how that the~
new creation beginneth where the old creation ended. It showeth, moreover, that~
the Son of God, Who is come not to destroy the law but to fulfil the law,~
~(Matth. v. 17,) is not under the law, but above the law. Neither was it by the~
law, but by the Word, that the world was created, as it is written By the Word~
of the Lord were the heavens made. (Ps. xxxii. 6.) The law, then, is not~
destroyed, but fulfilled, in the Redemption of fallen man. Whence also the~
Apostle saith Put off, concerning the former conversation, the old man, which~
is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; and be renewed in the spirit of~
your mind; and put on the new man,

It was well that He began to heal on the Sabbath, that He might show Himself to~
be the Creator, weaving in one with another of His works, and continuing that~
which He had already begun, even as a workman, being to repair an house,~
beginneth not to take down that which is old from the foundations, but from the~
roof. Thus doth the Lord begin to lay to His hand again, in that place whence~
last He hath lifted it; then He beginneth which after God is created in~
righteousness and true holiness. (Eph. iv. 22.) with things lesser, that He may~
go on to things greater. Even men are able to deliver other men from evil~
spirits, albeit with the word of God to command the dead to rise again is for~
God's power alone. Perchance, also, this woman, the mother-in-law of Simon and~
Andrew, was a type of our nature, stricken down with the great fever of sin, and~
burning with unlawful lusts after divers objects. Nor would I say that the~
passion which rageth in the mind is a lesser fire than that fever which burneth~
the body. Covetousness, and lust, and uncleanness, and vain desires, and~
strivings, and anger these be our fevers.

[Ant 2]
And devils also came out of many, * crying out and saying Thou art Christ the~
Son of God. And He, rebuking them, suffered them not to speak, for they knew~
that He was Christ.

[Oratio 2]
Praise be to thee, O Lord, for the blessed and solemn victory of thine holy~
servants Cosmas and Damian, whereby Thou, in thine unspeakable Providence, wast~
pleased to give unto them everlasting glory, and unto us a shield and succour.

[Ant 3]
All they that had * any sick brought them unto Jesus, and He healed them.

[Oratio 3]
Lord, we beseech thee that thine heavenly Peace- Offering may so effectually~
work for all thy people, which are now bowing themselves down before thee, that~
they may ever continue in meek obedience to thy commandments.
