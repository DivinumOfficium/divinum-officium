[Lectio1]
From the Book of Revelation
!Rev 19:1-5
1 After these things I heard as it were the voice of much people in heaven,~
saying: Alleluia. Salvation, and glory, and power is to our God.
2 For true and just are his judgments, who hath judged the great harlot which~
corrupted the earth with her fornication, and hath revenged the blood of his~
servants, at her hands.
3 And again they said: Alleluia. And her smoke ascendeth for ever and ever.
4 And the four and twenty ancients, and the four living creatures fell down and~
adored God that sitteth upon the throne, saying: Amen; Alleluia.
5 And a voice came out from the throne, saying: Give praise to our God, all ye~
his servants; and you that fear him, little and great.

!Rev 19:6-10
6 And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of~
many waters, and as the voice of great thunders, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord~
our God the Almighty hath reigned.
7 Let us be glad and rejoice, and give glory to him; for the marriage of the~
Lamb is come, and his wife hath prepared herself.
8 And it is granted to her that she should clothe herself with fine linen,~
glittering and white. For the fine linen are the justifications of saints.
9 And he said to me: Write: Blessed are they that are called to the marriage~
supper of the Lamb. And he saith to me: These words of God are true.
10 And I fell down before his feet, to adore him. And he saith to me: See thou~
do it not: I am thy fellow servant, and of thy brethren, who have the testimony~
of Jesus. Adore God. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.

!Rev 19:11-16
11 And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him~
was called faithful and true, and with justice doth he judge and fight.
12 And his eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many diadems, and~
he had a name written, which no man knoweth but himself.
13 And he was clothed with a garment sprinkled with blood; and his name is~
called, the Word of God.
14 And the armies that are in heaven followed him on white horses, clothed in~
fine linen, white and clean.
15 And out of his mouth proceedeth a sharp two edged sword; that with it he may~
strike the nations. And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; and he treadeth~
the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of God the Almighty.
16 And he hath on his garment, and on his thigh written: King of Kings, and Lord~
of Lords.

[Oratio 2]
Almighty God, Who showest to them that be in error the light of thy truth,~

all them that are admitted into the fellowship of Christ's Religion, that they~
may eschew those things that are contrary to their profession, and follow all~
such things as are agreeable to the same.

A little while * and you shall not see me; and again a little while, and you~
