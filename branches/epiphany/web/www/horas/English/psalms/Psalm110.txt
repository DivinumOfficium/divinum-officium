110:2 Great are the works of the Lord: sought out according to all his wills.
110:3 His work is praise and magnificence: and his justice continueth for ever and ever.
110:4 He hath made a remembrance of his wonderful works, being a merciful and gracious Lord:
110:5 He hath given food to them that fear him. He will be mindful for ever of his covenant:
110:6 He will shew forth to his people the power of his works.
110:7 That he may give them the inheritance of the Gentiles: the works of his hands are truth and judgment.
110:8 All his commandments are faithful: confirmed for ever and ever, made in truth and equity.
110:9 He hath sent redemption to his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever. Holy and terrible is his name:
110:10 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. A good understanding to all that do it: his praise continueth for ever and ever.
