Lesson
!1 Thess. 1:2-10
Brethren: We give thanks to God always for you all, continually making a remembrance of you in our prayers; being mindful before God our Father of your work of faith, and labor, and charity, and your enduring hope in our Lord Jesus Christ. We know, brethren, beloved of God, how you were chosen. For our Gospel was not delivered to you in word only, but in power also, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much fullness, as indeed you know what manner of men we have been among you for your sakes. And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, receiving the word in great tribulation, with joy of the Holy Spirit, so that you became a pattern to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia. For from you the word of the Lord has been spread abroad, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith in God has gone forth, so that we need say nothing further. For they themselves report concerning us how we entered among you, and how you turned to God from idols, to serve the living and true God, and to await from heaven Jesus, His Son, Whom He raised from the dead, Who has delivered us from the wrath to come.

[Evangelium]
Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to
!Matt 13:31-35
At that time, Jesus spoke this parable to the crowds: The kingdom of heaven is~
like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field. This~
indeed is the smallest of all the seeds; but when it grows up it is larger than~
any herb and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and dwell in its~
branches. He told them another parable: The kingdom of heaven is like leaven,~
which a woman took and buried in three measures of flour, until all of it was~
leavened. All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables, and without~
parables he did not speak to them; that what was spoken by the prophet might be~
fulfilled, I will open My mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden since~
the foundation of the world.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 117:16-17
The right hand of the Lord has wrought strength; the right hand of the Lord has~
exalted me: I shall not die, but live, and shall declare the works of the Lord.

[Secreta]
May this offering, O God, we beseech You, cleanse and renew us, govern and~
protect us.
