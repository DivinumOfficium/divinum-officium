[Lectio]
Lesson from the book of Jeremias the Prophet.
!Jer 11:18-20
v.  But thou, O Lord, hast shewn me, and I have known: then thou shewedst me their doings. And I was as a meek lamb, that is carried to be a victim: and I knew not that they had devised counsels against me, saying: Let us put wood on his bread, and cut him off from the land of the living, and let his name be remembered no more. But thou, O Lord of Sabaoth, who judgest justly, and triest the reins and hearts, let me see thy revenge on them: for to thee I have revealed my cause.

[Graduale]
!Ps 34:13; 34:1-2
v.  But as for me, when they were troublesome to me, I was clothed with haircloth. I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer shall be turned into my bosom. 
V. Judge thou, O Lord, them that wrong me : overthrow them that fight against me. Take hold of arms and shield : and rise up to help me.

(deinde dicuntur semper)
Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, according to Mark
!Mark 14:1-72; 15:1-46
v.  Now the feast of the pasch, and of the Azymes was after two days;~
and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might by some wile~
lay hold on him, and kill him. But they said: Not on the festival day,~
lest there should be a tumult among the people. And when he was in~
Bethania, in the house of Simon the leper, and was at meat, there came a~
woman having an alabaster box of ointment of precious spikenard: and~
breaking the alabaster box, she poured it out upon his head. Now there~
were some that had indignation within themselves, and said: Why was this~
waste of the ointment made? For this ointment might have been sold for~
more than three hundred pence, and given to the poor. And they murmured~
against her. But Jesus said: Let her alone, why do you molest her? She~
hath wrought a good work upon me. For the poor you have always with you:~
and whensoever you will, you may do them good: but me you have not~
always. She hath done what she could: she is come beforehand to anoint~
my body for burial. Amen, I say to you, wheresoever this gospel shall be~
preached in the whole world, that also which she hath done, shall be~
told for a memorial of her. And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went~
to the chief priests, to betray him to them. Who hearing it were glad;~
and they promised him they would give him money. And he sought how he~
might conveniently betray him. Now on the first day of the unleavened~
bread, when they sacrificed the pasch, the disciples say to him: Whither~
wilt thou that we go, and prepare for thee to eat the pasch? And he~
sendeth two of his disciples, and saith to them: Go ye into the city;~
and there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water, follow him;~
And whithersoever he shall go in, say to the master of the house, The~
master saith, Where is my refectory, where I may eat the pasch with my~
disciples? And he will shew you a large dining room furnished; and there~
prepare ye for us. And his disciples went their way, and came into the~
city; and they found as he had told them, and they prepared the pasch.~
And when evening was come, he cometh with the twelve. And when they were~
at table and eating, Jesus saith: Amen I say to you, one of you that~
eateth with me shall betray me. But they began to be sorrowful, and to~
say to him one by one: Is it I? Who saith to them: One of the twelve,~
who dippeth with me his hand in the dish. And the Son of man indeed~
goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of~
man shall be betrayed. It were better for him, if that man had not been~
born. And whilst they were eating, Jesus took bread; and blessing,~
broke, and gave to them, and said: Take ye. This is my body. And having~
taken the chalice, giving thanks, he gave it to them. And they all drank~
of it. And he said to them: This is my blood of the new testament, which~
shall be shed for many. Amen I say to you, that I will drink no more of~
the fruit of the vine, until that day when I shall drink it new in the~
kingdom of God. And when they had said an hymn, they went forth to the~
mount of Olives. And Jesus saith to them: You will all be scandalized in~
my regard this night; for it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and~
the sheep shall be dispersed. But after I shall be risen again, I will~
go before you into Galilee. But Peter saith to him: Although all shall~
be scandalized in thee, yet not I. And Jesus saith to him: Amen I say to~
thee, to day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shall~
deny me thrice. But he spoke the more vehemently: Although I should die~
together with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner also said~
they all. And they came to a farm called Gethsemani. And he saith to his~
disciples: Sit you here, while I pray. And he taketh Peter and James and~
John with him; and he began to fear and to be heavy. And he saith to~
them: My soul is sorrowful even unto death; stay you here, and watch.~
And when he was gone forward a little, he fell flat on the ground; and~
he prayed, that if it might be, the hour might pass from him. And he~
saith: Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee: remove this~
chalice from me; but not what I will, but what thou wilt. And he cometh,~
and findeth them sleeping. And he saith to Peter: Simon, sleepest thou?~
couldst thou not watch one hour? Watch ye, and pray that you enter not~
into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. A~
going away again, he prayed, saying the same words. And when he~
returned, he found them again asleep, - for their eyes were heavy, - and~
they knew not what to answer him. And he cometh the third time, and~
saith to them: Sleep ye now, and take your rest. It is enough: the hour~
is come: behold the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of~
sinners. Rise up, let us go. Behold, he that will betray me is at hand.~
And while he was yet speaking, cometh Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve:~
and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief~
priests and the scribes and the ancients. And he that betrayed him, had~
given them a sign, saying: Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he; lay hold~
on him, and lead him away carefully. And when he was come, immediately~
going up to him, he saith: Hail, Rabbi; and he kissed him. But they laid~
hands on him, and held him. An one of them that stood by, drawing a~
sword, struck a servant of the chief priest, and cut off his ear. And~
Jesus answering, said to them: Are you come out as to a robber, with~
swords and staves to apprehend me? I was daily with you in the temple~
teaching, and you did not lay hands on me. But that the scriptures may~
be fulfilled. Then his disciples leaving him, all fled away. And a~
certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth cast about his~
naked body; and they laid hold on him. But he, casting off the linen~
cloth, fled from them naked. And they brought Jesus to the high priest;~
and all the priests and the scribes and the ancients assembled together.~
And Peter followed him from afar off, even into the court of the high~
priest; and he sat with the servants at the fire, and warmed himself.~
And the chief priests and all the council sought for evidence against~
Jesus, that they might put him to death, and found none. For many bore~
false witness against him, and their evidences were not agreeing. And~
some rising up, bore false witness against him, saying: We heard him~
say, I will destroy this temple made with hands, and within three days I~
will build another not made with hands. And their witness did not agree.~
And the high priest rising up in the midst, asked Jesus, saying:~
Answerest thou nothing to the things that are laid to thy charge by~
these men? But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high~
priest asked him, and said to him: Art thou the Christ the Son of the~
blessed God? And Jesus said to him: I am. And you shall see the Son of~
man sitting on the right hand of the power of God, and coming with the~
clouds of heaven. Then the high priest rending his garments, saith: What~
need we any further witnesses? You have heard the blasphemy. What think~
you? Who all condemned him to be guilty of death. And some began to spit~
on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him:~
Prophesy: and the servants struck him with the palms of their hands. Now~
when Peter was in the court below, there cometh one of the maidservants~
of the high priest. And when she had seen Peter warming himself, looking~
on him she saith: Thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth. But he denied,~
saying: I neither know nor understand what thou sayest. And he went~
forth before the court; and the cock crew. And again a maidservant~
seeing him, began to say to the standers by: This is one of them. But he~
denied again. And after a while they that stood by said again to Peter:~
Surely thou art one of them; for thou art also a Galilean. But he began~
to curse and to swear, saying; I know not this man of whom you speak.~
And immediately the cock crew again. And Peter remembered the word that~
Jesus had said unto him: Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt thrice~
deny me. And he began to weep. AND straightway in the morning, the chief~
priests holding a consultation with the ancients and the scribes and the~
whole council, binding Jesus, led him away, and delivered him to Pilate.~
And Pilate asked him: Art thou the king of the Jews? But he answering,~
saith to him: Thou sayest it. And the chief priests accused him in many~
things. And Pilate again asked him, saying: Answerest thou nothing?~
behold in how many things they accuse thee. But Jesus still answered~
nothing; so that Pilate wondered. Now on the festival day he was wont to~
release unto them one of the prisoners, whomsoever they demanded. And~
there was one called Barabbas, who was put in prison with some seditious~
men, who in the sedition had committed murder. And when the multitude~
was come up, they began to desire that he would do, as he had ever done~
unto them. And Pilate answered them, and said: Will you that I release~
to you the king of the Jews? For he knew that the chief priests had~
delivered him up out of envy. But the chief priests moved the people,~
that he should rather release Barabbas to them. And Pilate again~
answering, saith to them: What will you then that I do to the king of~
the Jews? But they again cried out: Crucify him. And Pilate saith to~
them: Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more: Crucify~
him. And so Pilate being willing to satisfy the people, released to them~
Barabbas, and delivered up Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be~
crucified. And the soldiers led him away into the court of the palace,~
and they called together the whole band: And they clothe him with~
purple, and platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon him. And they~
began to salute him: Hail, king of the Jews. And they struck his head~
with a reed: and they did spit on him. And bowing their knees, they~
adored him. And after they had mocked him, they took off the purple from~
him, and put his own garments on him, and they led him out to crucify~
him. And they forced one Simon a Cyrenian who passed by, coming out of~
the country, the father of Alexander and of Rufus, to take up his cross.~
And they bring him into the place called Golgotha, which being~
interpreted is, The place of Calvary. And they gave him to drink wine~
mingled with myrrh; but he took it not. And crucifying him, they divided~
his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take. And it~
was the third hour, and they crucified him. And the inscription of his~
cause was written over: THE KING OF THE JEWS. And with him they crucify~
two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left. And~
the scripture was fulfilled, which saith: And with the wicked he was~
reputed. And they that passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads,~
and saying: Vah, thou that destroyest the temple of God, and in three~
days buildest it up again; Save thyself, coming down from the cross. In~
like manner also the chief priests mocking, said with the scribes one to~
another: He saved others; himself he cannot save. Let Christ the king of~
Israel come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And~
they that were crucified with him reviled him. And when the sixth hour~
was come, there was darkness over the whole earth until the ninth hour.~
And at the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying: Eloi,~
Eloi, lamma sabacthani? Which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why~
hast thou forsaken me? And some of the standers by hearing, said: Behold~
he calleth Elias. And one running and filling a sponge with vinegar, and~
putting it upon a reed, gave him to drink, saying: Stay, let us see if~
Elias come to take him down. And Jesus having cried out with a loud~
voice, gave up the ghost. And the veil of the temple was rent in two,~
from the top to the bottom. And the centurion who stood over against~
him, seeing that crying out in this manner he had given up the ghost,~
said: Indeed this man was the son of God. And there were also women~
looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother~
of James the less and of Joseph, and Salome: Who also when he was in~
Galilee followed him, and ministered to him, and many other women that~
came up with him to Jerusalem.~

And when evening was now come, - because~
it was the Parasceve, that is, the day before the sabbath, - Joseph of~
Arimathea, a noble counsellor, who was also himself looking for the~
kingdom of God, came and went in boldly to Pilate, and begged the body~
of Jesus. But Pilate wondered that he should be already dead. And~
sending for the centurion, he asked him if he were already dead. And~
when he had understood it by the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.~
And Joseph buying fine linen, and taking him down, wrapped him up in the~
fine linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewed out of a rock.~
And he rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre.
