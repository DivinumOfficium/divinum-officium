Lesson from the Acts of Apostles
!Acts 19:1-8.
In those days, it was while Apollos was in Corinth that Paul, after passing through the upper districts, came to Ephesus and found certain disciples; and he said to them, Did you receive the Holy spirit when you became believers? But they said to him, We have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit. And he said, How then were you baptized? They said, With John’s baptism. Then Paul said, John baptized the people with a baptism of repentance, telling them to believe in Him Who was to come after him, that is, in Jesus. On hearing this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus; and when Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they began to speak in tongues and to prophesy. There were about twelve men in all. Now for three months he used to go to the synagogue and speak confidently, holding discussions and trying to persuade them about the kingdom of God.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 14:15-21.
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples, If you love Me, keep My commandments.~
And I will ask the Father and He will give you another Advocate to dwell with~
you forever, the Spirit of truth Whom the world cannot receive, because it~
neither sees Him nor knows Him. But you shall know Him, because He will dwell~
with you, and be in you. I will not leave you orphans: I will come to you. Yet a~
little while and the world no longer sees Me. But you see Me, for I live and you~
shall live. In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I~
in you. He who has My commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves Me. But he~
who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and manifest Myself~
to him.

[Offertorium]
!Ps. 103:30-31.
