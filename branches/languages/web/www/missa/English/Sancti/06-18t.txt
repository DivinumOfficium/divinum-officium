[Lectio]
A reading from the Epistle of blessed Paul the Apostle to the Romans.
!Rom 5:1-5
Brethren: Being justified therefore by faith, let us have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ: By whom also we have access through faith into this grace, wherein we stand, and glory in the hope of the glory of the sons of God. And not only so; but we glory also in tribulations, knowing that tribulation worketh patience; And patience trial; and trial hope; And hope confoundeth not: because the charity of God is poured forth in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost, who is given to us. 

[Graduale]
!Sap 3:1-2; 3:3
The souls of the just are in the hand of God, and the torment of death shall not touch them.
In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die: but they are in peace.~
Alleluia, alleluia.
V. These were true brothers, who could not be overcome in combat: who shedding their blood, followed the Lord. Alleluia.
