[Lectio]
Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Philippians
!Phil 3:7-12
Brethren: The things that were gain to me, these, for the sake of Christ, I have counted loss. Nay more, I count everything loss because of the excelling knowledge of Jesus Christ, my Lord. For His sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and I count them as dung that I may gain Christ and be found in Him, not having a justice of my own, which is from the Law, but that which is from faith in Christ, the justice from God based upon faith; so that I may know Him and the power of His Resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings: become like to Him in death, in the hope that somehow I may attain to the resurrection from the dead. Not that I have already obtained this, or already have been made perfect, but I press on hoping that I may lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus has laid hold of me.

[Secreta]
May these sacrificial gifts which Your devoted people heap upon Your altar, O Lord, become pleasing to You by the merits of blessed Francis, and, by Your mercy, helpful to us.

[Postcommunio]
We pray You, O Lord, that the heavenly sacrament which we have received, may by the intercession of blessed Francis, Your Confessor, help us both in this life and in the life everlasting.
