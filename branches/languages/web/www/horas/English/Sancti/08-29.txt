For Herod had laid hold upon John, * and bound him, and put him in prison, for Herodias' sake.
O Lord my King, * give me in a charger the head of John the Baptist.
The damsel danced, * and her mother charged her saying See thou ask nothing, but only the head of John.
John had rebuked Herod for Herodias' sake, * his brother Philip's wife, for he had taken her.
Give me in a charger the head of John the Baptist. * And the King was sorry, for his oath's sake.

camest forth out of the womb, I sanctified thee, and made thee a prophet unto~
the nations.

shall send thee: and whatsoever I shall command thee, thou shalt speak.
8 Be not afraid at their presence: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the~
Lord.
9 And the Lord put forth his hand, and touched my mouth: and the Lord said to~

From the Book upon Virgins, written by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!ii. 6.
We must not hurry by the record of the Blessed Baptist John. We must ask what he~
was, and by whom, and why, and how, and when he was slain. He was a righteous~
man murdered by adulterers. The guilty passed upon their judge the sentence of~
death. Moreover, the death of the Prophet was the fee of a dancing-girl. And~
lastly, there was a feature about it from which even savages shrink; the order~
for completing the atrocity was given amid the merriment of a dinner-party. From~
banquet to prison, from prison to banquet, that was the course run by the~
servants of the murderer. How many horrors does this simple crime embrace within~
its details?

[Lectio5]
Who is there, that, on seeing the messenger hasten from the dinner-table to the~
prison, would not have forthwith concluded that he carried an order for the~
Prophet's release. If any one had heard that it was Herod's birth-day, and that~
he was giving a great feast, and that he had offered a damsel the choice of~
whatever she listed, and that thereupon a messenger had been sent to John's~
dungeon if any one, I say, had heard this, what would he have supposed He~
would have concluded that the damsel had asked and obtained John's freedom. What~
have executions in common with dinners or death with gaiety While the~
banquet was going on, the Prophet was hurried to death, by an order from the~
reveller whom he had not troubled even by a prayer for release. He was slain~
with the sword, and his head was served up in a plate. This was the new dish~
demanded by a cruelty which the Feast had been powerless to glut.

[Responsory5]
R. This is he which knew righteousness, and saw great wonders, and made his~
prayer unto the Most High
* And he is numbered among the Saints.
V. This is he which loved not his life in this world, and is come unto an~
everlasting kingdom.
R. And he is numbered among the Saints.

[Lectio6]
Look, savage King, look at a decoration which suiteth well with thy banquet.~
Put out thine hand, so as to lose no part of the luxury of cruelty, and let the~
streams of the sacred blood run between thy fingers. Thine hunger the dinner~
hath been unable to satisfy, thy cups have not been able to quench thine inhuman~
thirst suck, suck the blood which the still palpitating veins are discharging~
from the place where the neck has been severed Look at the eyes Even in~
death they remain the eyes of a witness of thine uncleanness, but they are~
closing themselves upon the spectacle of thy pleasures. Those eyes indeed are~
shutting but it seems not so much from the laws of natural death, as from horror~
at the scene of thine enjoyment. The golden mouth, whose bloodless lips are~
silent now, can repeat no more the denunciation which thou couldest not bear to~
hear and still thou art afraid of it.

[Responsory6]
R. The Lord made him honourable, and defended him from his enemies, and kept him~
safe from those that lay in wait for him,
* And gave him perpetual glory.
V. He went down with him into the pit, and left him not in bonds.
R. And gave him perpetual glory.
&Gloria
R. And gave him perpetual glory.

From the Holy Gospel according to Mark
!Mark 6:17-29
At that time Herod had sent forth, and laid hold upon John, and bound him in~
prison, for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife, for he had married her.~
And so on.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!New Sermons.
The reading of the Holy Gospel hath set a scene of cruelty before our eyes even~
the head of St John in a charger a message of death sent forth to discharge the~
bloody commands of one that hateth the truth a damsel dancing, and a mother~
rabid a rash oath sworn in the midst of uncleanness and the revels of a supper~
and a wicked fulfilment of the oath so sworn. It befell unto John according to~
his own saying. For he had said concerning the Lord Jesus Christ: He must~
increase, but I must decrease (John iii. 30,) so John decreased by an head, and~
Christ's height was made higher upon the Cross. The truth drew hatred. It could~
not be borne in patience that the holy man of God should utter a rebuke, albeit~
he sought by his rebuke nothing but the soul's health of them to whom he~
addressed it. They repaid him evil for good.

For what could he say but that whereof he was full And what could they answer~
him but that whereof they were full He sowed wheat, and found thorns. He had~
said unto the King It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife. Lust~
had got the better of the King, and he kept a woman whom it was not lawful for~
him to have, even his brother's wife. But she pleased him, so that his cruelty~
was lulled. He respected the Saint who had spoken the truth to him. But the~
horrible woman conceived hatred, and by - and - by brought it forth. When she~
brought forth, she brought forth a girl, a dancing-girl.

!Commemoratio for the Holy Martyr Sabina.
Sabina was a Roman lady, the wife of a distinguished nobleman named Valentine.~
The Christian faith was taught to her by a maiden named Seraphia. After the~
martyrdom of this holy virgin, Sabina gathered together her reliques, and buried~
them with godly service. For this cause she was in a little while arrested,~
under the Emperor Hadrian, and brought before the Judge Elpidius. Art thou, said~
he, the same Sabina who is so distinguished for her blood and for her marriage~
She answered "I am, but I give thanks to my Lord Jesus Christ for having~
delivered me through the prayers of His hand-maiden Seraphia from the troubling~
of devils." Divers attempts were made to make her change her mind, but when they~
proved in vain the Praefect passed sentence of death upon her for despising the~
gods. The Christians laid her body in the same grave in which she had herself~
laid that of Seraphia, her teacher in the faith.

The Lesson is taken from the Treatise concerning Virgins by St. Ambrose the Bishop
We must not hurry past the record of blessed Baptist John. We must ask what he was ; by whom he was slain ; and why and how. He was a righteous man, murdered for his righteousness by adulterers. He was a judge, who suffered condemnation to death by the guilty ones because he had justly judged their guilt. He was the prophet whose death was a fee paid to a dancing-girl for a lascivious dance. And lastly a thing from which even savages would shrink his head was served up as a dish at a banquet. For the order to commit the atrocity was given amid the merriment of a dinner-party ; and the servants of the murderer introduced the murder amid the courses of the meal, running from banquet to prison, and from prison to banquet! See how many infamies are contained in this one crime.
