From the holy Gospel according to John
!Luke 7:36-50
In that time one of the Pharisees desired him to eat with him. And he went into~
the house of the Pharisee, And so on.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great.)
!33rd on the Gospels.
When I think of the repentance of Mary Magdalene I feel nigher to weep than to~
say ought. Is there indeed any man, however stony his heart, who is not somewhat~
moved to follow the ensample of her repentance by the tears of that poor sinful~
woman? She weighed what she did, and would not that what she did should be~
niggardly. She came unbidden among the guests, and obtruded her tears upon the~
banquet. Ye may hence gather her sorrow, that she was content to weep at a~
feast.

We believe that this woman, of whom Luke saith that she was a woman in the city,~
which was a sinner, and whom John nameth Mary, (xi. 2,) was the same as she of~
whom it is written in Mark (xvi. 9) that the Lord had cast out of her seven~
devils. And what signify seven devils but all manner of sin? For even as seven~
days do represent all time, so doth the number seven stand for all. Therefore is~
it said that Mary had seven devils, because she was full of all sin.

But see how she realized the depth of her own filthiness, and came to be washed~
to the Well of Mercy, before all them which were bidden to the feast. The~
bitterness of her inward shame made her esteem it a light thing to be despised~
outwardly. At what then do we marvel, my brethren? That she came, or that the~
Lord welcomed her? Or would it be truer for me to say that He drew her to Him~
and welcomed her when she came? for His mercy inwardly drew her, and, when she~
came, His gentleness openly welcomed her.

[Ant 2]
The Master saith, My time is at hand; * I will keep the Passover at thy house~
with My disciples.

[Oratio 2]
Grant, we beseech thee, O Almighty God, that the honour of man's nature, which~
gluttony hath degraded, may be seasonably renewed by strictness in keeping of~
this healthful Fast.

[Ant 3]
With desire I have desired * to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.

[Oratio 3]
O Lord, we beseech thee deal mercifully with thy people, and fill plentifully~
with the rich things of thy commandments all them who at this time do, to fulfil~
thy will, turn away from that which displeaseth thee.

v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 7:36-50
7:36 And one of the Pharisees desired him to eat with him. And he went into the house of the Pharisee, and sat down to meat.
7:37 And behold a woman that was in the city, a sinner, when she knew that he sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment;
7:38 And standing behind at his feet, she began to wash his feet, with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.
7:39 And the Pharisee, who had invited him, seeing it, spoke within himself, saying: This man, if he were a prophet, would know surely who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him, that she is a sinner.
7:40 And Jesus answering, said to him: Simon, I have somewhat to say to thee. But he said: Master, say it.
7:41 A certain creditor had two debtors, the one who owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.
7:42 And whereas they had not wherewith to pay, he forgave them both. Which therefore of the two loveth him most?
7:43 Simon answering, said: I suppose that he to whom he forgave most. And he said to him: Thou hast judged rightly.
7:44 And turning to the woman, he said unto Simon: Dost thou see this woman? I entered into thy house, thou gavest me no water for my feet; but she with tears hath washed my feet, and with her hairs hath wiped them.
7:45 Thou gavest me no kiss; but she, since she came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet.
7:46 My head with oil thou didst not anoint; but she with ointment hath anointed my feet.
7:47 Wherefore I say to thee: Many sins are forgiven her, because she hath loved much. But to whom less is forgiven, he loveth less.
7:48 And he said to her: Thy sins are forgiven thee.
7:49 And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves: Who is this that forgiveth sins also?
7:50 And he said to the woman: Thy faith hath made thee safe, go in peace.
