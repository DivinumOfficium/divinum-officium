9:1 I will give praise to thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: * I will relate all thy wonders.
9:2 I will be glad and rejoice in thee: * I will sing to thy name, O thou most high.
9:3 When my enemy shall be turned back: * they shall be weakened and perish before thy face.
9:4 For thou hast maintained my judgment and my cause: * thou hast sat on the throne, who judgest justice.
9:5 Thou hast rebuked the Gentiles, and the wicked one hath perished: * thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever.
9:6 The swords of the enemy have failed unto the end: * and their cities thou hast destroyed.
9:7 Their memory hath perished with a noise. * But the Lord remaineth for ever.
9:8 He hath prepared his throne in judgment: * And he shall judge the world in equity, he shall judge the people in justice.
9:9 And the Lord is become a refuge for the poor: * a helper in due time in tribulation.
9:10 And let them trust in thee who know thy name: * for thou hast not forsaken them that seek thee, O Lord.
9:12 Sing ye to the Lord, who dwelleth in Sion: * declare his ways among the Gentiles.
9:13 For requiring their blood he hath remembered them: * he hath not forgotten the cry of the poor.
9:14 Have mercy on me, O Lord: * see my humiliation which I suffer from my enemies.
9:15 Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death, * that I may declare all thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion.
9:16 I will rejoice in thy salvation: * the Gentiles have stuck fast in the destruction which they have prepared.
9:17 Their foot hath been taken * in the very snare which they hid.
9:18 The Lord shall be known when he executeth judgments: * the sinner hath been caught in the works of his own hands.
9:19 The wicked shall be turned into hell, * all the nations that forget God.
9:20 For the poor man shall not be forgotten to the end: * the patience of the poor shall not perish for ever.
9:21 Arise, O Lord, let not man be strengthened: * let the Gentiles be judged in thy sight.
9:21 Appoint, O Lord, a lawgiver over them: * that the Gentiles may know themselves to be but men.
9:22 Why, O Lord, hast thou retired afar off? * why dost thou slight us in our wants, in the time of trouble?
9:23 Whilst the wicked man is proud, the poor is set on fire: * they are caught in the counsels which they devise.
9:24 For the sinner is praised in the desires of his soul: * and the unjust man is blessed.
9:25 The sinner hath provoked the Lord, * according to the multitude of his wrath he will not seek him.
9:26 God is not before his eyes: * his ways are filthy at all times.
9:27 Thy judgments are removed from his sight: * he shall rule over all his enemies.
9:28 For he hath said in his heart: * I shall not be moved from generation to generation, and shall be without evil.
9:29 His mouth is full of cursing, and of bitterness, and of deceit: * under his tongue are labour and sorrow.
9:30 He sitteth in ambush with the rich, in private places, * that he may kill the innocent.
9:31 His eyes are upon the poor man: * he lieth in wait, in secret, like a lion in his den.
9:32 He lieth in ambush, that he may catch the poor man: * so catch the poor, whilst he draweth him to him.
9:32 In his net he will bring him down, * he will crouch and fall, when he shall have power over the poor.
9:32 For he hath said in his heart: God hath forgotten, * he hath turned away his face, not to see to the end.
9:33 Arise, O Lord God, let thy hand be exalted: * forget not the poor.
9:34 Wherefore hath the wicked provoked God? * for he hath said in his heart: He will not require it.
9:35 Thou seest it, for thou considerest labour and sorrow: * that thou mayst deliver them into thy hands.
9:36 To thee is the poor man left: * thou wilt be a helper to the orphan.
9:37 Break thou the arm of the sinner and of the malignant: * his sin shall be sought, and shall not be found.
9:38 The Lord shall reign to eternity, yea, for ever and ever: * ye Gentiles shall perish from his land.
9:39 The Lord hath heard the desire of the poor: * thy ear hath heard the preparation of their heart.
9:39 To judge for the fatherless and for the humble, * that man may no more presume to magnify himself upon earth.
