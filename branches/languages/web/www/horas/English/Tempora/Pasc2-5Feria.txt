Lesson from the Acts of Apostles
!Acts 25:1-5
1 Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days, he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.
2 And the chief priests, and principal men of the Jews, went unto him against Paul: and they besought him,
3 Requesting favour against him, that he would command him to be brought to Jerusalem, laying wait to kill him in the way.
4 But Festus answered: That Paul was kept in Caesarea, and that he himself would very shortly depart thither.
5 Let them, therefore, saith he, among you that are able, go down with me, and accuse him, if there be any crime in the man.

!Acts 25:6-8
6 And having tarried among them no more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea, and the next day he sat in the judgment seat; and commanded Paul to be brought.
7 Who being brought, the Jews stood about him, who were come down from Jerusalem, objecting many and grievous causes, which they could not prove;
8 Paul making answer for himself: Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I offended in any thing.

!Acts 25:9-12
9 But Festus, willing to show the Jews a pleasure, answering Paul, said: Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?
10 Then Paul said: I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged. To the Jews I have done no injury, as thou very well knowest.
11 For if I have injured them, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die. But if there be none of these things whereof they accuse me, no man may deliver me to them: I appeal to Caesar.
12 Then Festus having conferred with the council, answered: Hast thou appealed to Caesar? To Caesar shalt thou go.
