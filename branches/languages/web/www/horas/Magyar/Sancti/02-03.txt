O God, Who, year by year, dost gladden us by the solemn Feast-day of thy blessed~
Confessor and Pontifex Blase mercifully grant unto all who keep his birthday,~
grace to follow after the pattern of his godly conversation.

!Commemoratio for St Blase.
This Blase was chosen Bishop of the city of Sebaste in Armenia, in which place~
he enjoyed a great reputation for virtue. When Diocletian began to make the~
Christians the objects of his insatiable cruelty, the Saint hid himself in a~
cave on Mount Argasus, where he lay till he was found by some of the soldiers of~
Agricolaus the President, who were out hunting. He was brought before the~
President, who commanded him to be thrown into irons. While he was in prison,~
Blase healed many of the sick, who were brought to him on account of his~
reputation of saintliness, and among others a boy who had been despaired of by~
the physicians, and who was at the point of death, from a thorn which had become~
fixed in his throat. Blase appeared twice before the President, but neither~
cajolements nor threats could induce him to sacrifice to the gods. He was first~
beaten with rods, and afterwards put on the rack, where his flesh was mangled~
with iron combs. At last his head was cut off, whereby he finished a noble~
testimony to the faith which is in Christ our Lord. He bore witness on the 3rd~
day of February, (in the year of salvation 316)
