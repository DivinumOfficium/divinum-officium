Szent János Apostol jelenéseinek könyvébõl
!Rev 21:9-11
9 Akkor odajött hozzám a hét angyal közül az egyik, az, akinél az utolsó hét csapással teli hét csésze volt, és megszólított: "Gyere, megmutatom neked a menyasszonyt, a Bárány hitvesét!" 
10 És lélekben elvitt egy nagy magas hegyre, s ott megmutatta nekem a mennybõl, az Istentõl alászállt szent várost, Jeruzsálemet. 
11 Isten dicsõségét sugározta. Ragyogott, mint a drágakõ, mint a kristálytiszta jáspis. 

[Lectio2]
!Rev 21:12-15
12 Széles, magas fala volt, rajta tizenkét kapu. A kapuk fölött tizenkét angyal. Nevek voltak rájuk írva, mégpedig Izrael fiai tizenkét törzsének a nevei. 
13 Keleten három kapu, északon három kapu, délen három kapu és nyugaton három kapu. 
14 A város falának tizenkét alapköve volt, rajtuk a Bárány tizenkét apostolának tizenkét neve. 
15 Annál, aki beszélt velem, arany mérõnád volt, hogy megmérje a várost, kapuit és falát. 

[Lectio3]
!Rev 21:16-18
16 A város négyszögben épült, a hossza annyi volt, mint a szélessége. Megmérte a várost e náddal: tizenkétezer stádium. Hossza, szélessége és magassága ugyanannyi volt. 
17 Megmérte a falat: száznegyvennégy könyök emberi mérték szerint, ami egyenlõ az angyal mértékével is. 
18 Falai jáspiskõbõl épültek, a város pedig kristályhoz hasonló színaranyból. 

[Lectio4]
The Rites whereof the Church of Rome maketh use for the hallowing of Churches~
and Altars were first instituted by the blessed Pope Sylvester. From the very~
time of the Apostles there had been places set apart for God, where assemblies~
took place upon the first day of every week, and where the Christians were used~
to pray, to hear the word of God, and to receive the Eucharist, which places~
were by some called Oratories and by others Churches. But these places were not~
dedicated with so solemn a form, nor did they set up therein an Altar for a~
pillar, and pour chrism thereon, (Gen. xxviii. 18,) for a figure of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who is Himself our Altar, our~
Victim, and our Priest.

[Lectio5]
But when the Emperor Constantine had by the Sacrament of Baptism received health~
both of body and soul, then first in a law by him published was it allowed to~
the Christians throughout the whole world to build Churches, to the which holy~
building he exhorted them by his example as well as by his decree. He dedicated~
in his own Lateran Palace a Church to the Saviour, and built hard by it a~
Cathedral in the name of St John the Baptist, upon the place where he had been~
baptized by holy Silvester and cleansed from his leprosy. This Cathedral was~
hallowed by the said Pope upon the 9th day of November. It is this consecration,~
the memory whereof is still celebrated upon this day, the first whereon the~
public consecration of a Church ever took place in Rome, and the image of the~
Saviour was seen by the Roman people painted upon the wall.

[Lectio6]
The Blessed Silvester afterwards decreed, when he was consecrating the Altar of~
the Prince of the Apostles, that Altars were thenceforward to be made of stone~
only, but notwithstanding this the Lateran Cathedral hath the altar made of~
wood. This is not surprising. From St Peter to Silvester the Popes had not been~
able, by reason of persecutions, to abide fixedly in one place, and they~
celebrated the Holy Liturgy in cellars, in burying - places, in the houses of~
godly persons, or wherever need drave them, upon a wooden altar made like an~
empty box. When peace was given to the Church, holy Silvester took this box, and~
to do honour to the Prince of the Apostles, who is said to have offered~
sacrifice thereon, and to the other Popes who thereon had been used to execute~
the mystery even unto that time, set it in the first Church, even the Lateran,~
and ordained that no one but the Bishop of Rome should celebrate the Liturgy~
thereon for all time coming. The original Lateran Cathedral, cast down and~
destroyed by fires, pillage, and earthquakes, and renewed by the constant care~
of the Popes, was at last rebuilt afresh, and solemnly consecrated by Pope~
Benedict XIII., a Friar Preacher, upon the 28th day of April, in the year 1726,~
the memory of which Festival he ordained to be kept upon this day. In the year~
1884 Leo XIII. took in hand a work which had received the sanction of his~
predecessor Pius IX. The great sanctuary, the walls of which were giving way~
with age, was lengthened and widened, a task of immense labour. The ancient~
mosaic had been renewed previously in several places; it was now restored~
according to the original design, and transferred to the new apse, the~
embellishment of which was carried out with great magnificence. The transept was~
redecorated, and its ceiling and woodwork repaired. A sacristy, a residence for~
the canons, and a portico connecting with the baptistery of Constantine, were~
added to the existing buildings.

!Commemoratio S. Theodori
This Theodore was a Christian soldier, who was arrested in the reign of the~
Emperor Maximian for having set fire to a temple of idols. The Commander of the~
Legion offered him pardon if he would profess repentance and curse the Christian~
faith, but, as he refused to swerve as regarding the confession of his belief,~
he was cast into prison. There he was tormented with iron claws. As they were~
tearing the flesh off his ribs, he sang joyfully (the 33rd Psalm) I will bless~
the Lord at all times. Thereafter he was thrown upon an heap of burning wood,~
and there, still praying and praising God, he gave up his soul to Christ, upon~
the 9th day of November, (in the year of salvation 304.) The Lady Eusebia~
wrapped his body in a winding-sheet, and buried it on her own farm.
