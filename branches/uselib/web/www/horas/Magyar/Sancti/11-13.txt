[Oratio]
O Almighty and everlasting God, Who in thy wonderful ordinance dost choose the~
weak things of the world to bring to nought the things that are strong,~
mercifully grant unto us thine unworthy servants, at the kindly prayers of thy~
blessed Confessor Diego, worthily to attain unto everlasting glory in heaven.
$Per Dominum

[Lectio4]
Diego was a Spaniard, and was born at the little town of SanNicola-del-Porto, in~
the diocese of Seville. From his childhood he learnt the more holy life under a~
godly Priest, (who lived hermit) in a lonely Church, and so served his~
apprenticeship. Afterwards, being fain to be more utterly God's only, he~
professed himself as a lay brother under the Rule of St Francis in the convent~
of the Friars Minor, called Observant, of Arrizafa. There he cheerfully bore the~
yoke of the lowliest obedience and the strictest observance. He was much given~
to contemplation, and a wonderful light from God shone in him, so that, though~
he was untaught, he could speak touching heavenly things strangely and as it~
were supernaturally.

[Lectio5]
In the Canary Islands, where he was warden of the brethren of his Order, he~
underwent much, earnestly willing to be a martyr, and by his word and ensample~
brought many unbelievers to Christ. He came to Rome in the year of the Jubilee,~
~(being that of our Lord 1450,) in the reign of Pope Nicolas V., and there was~
set to tend the. sick in the Convent of Ara Coeli, which work he did with such~
love, that although the city was plagued with a famine, the sufferers (whose~
sores he would sometimes cleanse even with his tongue) scarcely lacked anything~
needful. He was a burning and shining light of faith, and had the gift of~
healing, taking the oil from the lamp which burned before the image of the most~
blessed Mother of God, to whom he was earnestly devoted, and anointing the sick~
therewith, whereupon many were marvellously cured.

[Lectio6]
He was at Alcala when he understood that the end of his life was at hand.~
Clothed in a ragged cast-away habit, he fixed his eyes upon the Cross, and said~
with extraordinary earnestness 'Sweet the nails, and sweet the iron, Sweet the~
Weight That hung on thee,' thou that wast chosen to up-bear the Lord, the King~
of heaven, and so he gave up his soul to God, upon the 12th day of November, in~
the year of our Lord 1463. To satisfy the godly wishes of the multitude, his~
body was kept unburied for not a few months, and lay in a right sweet savour, as~
though the corruptible had already put on incorruption. He was famous for many~
and great miracles, and Pope Sixtus V. enrolled him in the number of the Saints.

[Lectio94]
Didacus was a Spaniard for the town of San Nicolas del Puerto in the diocese of Seville. From his early youth he served his apprenticeship in the life of holiness under the guidance of a good priest. Then, in order to unite himself more closely with God, he was professed as lay brother in the convent of Arizafa under the rule of Sty Francis Assisi. There he submitted eagerly to the yoke of humble obedience and regular observance, devoting himself primarily to contemplation. And God's life was so wonderfully pored on him that, although he was unlettered, he used to speak of heavenly things in remarkable way which was clearly due to divine inspiration. At a mission in the Canary islands he endured many hardships, burning with the desire for martyrdom, and brought many unbelives5r by his words and example to faith in Christ. He was sent to care for the sick at the convent of Ara Coeli at Rome, and carried out this work in a wonderful spirit of charity, the grace of healing shining out from him. Finally at Alcala he departed this life, in most holy way in the year 1463. Famous for miracles, he was numbered among Saints by Sixtus V.
