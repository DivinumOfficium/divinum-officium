Olvasmány szent Pál apostol Rómaiakhoz irott levelébõl
!Rom 5:1-5
 Mivel tehát a hit révén megigazultunk, békében élünk az Istennel, Urunk, Jézus Krisztus által.
2 Általa jutottunk hozzá a hitben a kegyelemhez, amelyben élünk, és dicsekszünk a reménységgel, hogy az isteni dicsõség részesei lehetünk.
3 De nemcsak ezzel, hanem még szenvedéseinkkel is dicsekszünk, mert tudjuk, hogy a szenvedésbõl türelem fakad,
4 a türelembõl kipróbált erény, a kipróbált erénybõl reménység.
5 A remény pedig nem csal meg, mert a nekünk ajándékozott Szentlélekkel kiáradt szívünkbe az Isten szeretete.

[Lectio2]
!Rom 5:6-9
6 Amikor még erõtlenek voltunk, Krisztus éppen akkor meghalt a bûnösökért,
7 noha az igazért is alig hal meg valaki, legföljebb jó emberért vállalják a halált.
8 Isten azonban azzal tesz tanúságot irántunk való szeretetérõl, hogy Krisztus meghalt értünk, amikor még bûnösök voltunk.
9 Most, hogy vére árán igazzá váltunk, még sokkal inkább megment bennünket haragjától.

[Lectio3]
!Rom 5:10-12
10 Mert ha Istent Fia halála kiengesztelte akkor, amikor még ellenségek voltunk, most hogy kibékültünk vele, annál inkább megmenekülünk az õ életében.
11 Sõt ezenfelül még dicsekszünk is az Istenben Urunk, Jézus Krisztus által, aki megszerezte nekünk a kiengesztelõdést.
12 Amint tehát egy ember által lépett a világba a bûn, majd a bûn folyományaként a halál, és így a halál minden embernek osztályrésze lett, mert mindnyájan vétkeztek...

From the Sermons of St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!2nd on St Stephen.
Christ, the Captain of the Martyrs, hath first suffered for us, leaving us an~
example that we should follow His steps, (i Pet. ii. 21.) And truly, Blessed~
Stephen followed them, when, having confessed Christ, he was stoned to death by~
the Jews, and obtained the crown which his name had foreshown. For the meaning~
of the Greek name Stephanos is a crown. Already he had a crown for his name, a~
foreshadowing of the martyr's palm which he beareth in heaven. Then they stoned him he did not rejoice at the thought that God would take~
vengeance on his persecutors. On the contrary, he prayed that they might be~
forgiven.

From the Sermons of St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!2nd on St Stephen.
Even after the glory of yesterday, bright with the splendour of Christ our~
Saviour's Birth, this day findeth itself an illumination of its own from the~
crown of the blessed Martyr Stephen. The whole earth knoweth how manfully he~
fought and conquered for he suffered at the very fountain-head of the Church,~
that is to say, in Jerusalem. It was in the Church there that he ministered as a~
Deacon and in the youthful springtime of life dyed with his blood the lily of~
his purity. His Passion is very glorious, and many ways wonderful, and when we~
read it in the Acts of the Apostles, we seem rather to see than to hear.

Then they stoned him he did not rejoice at the thought that God would take~
vengeance on his persecutors. On the contrary, he prayed that they might be~
forgiven. For he remembered the word of the Lord, that saith Vengeance~
belongeth unto Me, I will recompense, saith the Lord, (Heb. x. 30,) and again:~
Say not thou; I will recompense evil (to mine enemies), but wait on the Lord,~
and He shall save thee. (Prov. xx. 22.) The Lord God biddeth us also be patient,~
knowing that in the great day of retribution, we, as well as His holy martyrs,~
shall be righted.

Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kõnyvébõl
!Matt 23:34-35
Azon idõben mondá Jézus az iras'tudóknak és farizeusoknak: Nos, prófétákat,~
bölcseket és írástudókat küldök hozzátok. Közülük némelyeket megöltök és~
keresztre feszíttek. És így tovább.

Homily by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Bk. iv. Comment, on Matth. xxiii.
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the Prophets. The Jerusalem that~
killed the Prophets was not the material stone and houses, but they that dwelt~
therein. He wept over her with a father's love, as also it is written in another~
place that, when He saw the city, He wept over it. (Luke xix. 41.) How often~
would I have gathered thy children together. Here observe that Christ avoweth~
that He had been the Sender of all the former Prophets. Even as an hen gathereth~
her chickens under her wings. A similar figure is found in the Song of Moses in~
Deuteronomy, xxxii. II, As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her~
young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, and beareth them on her wings.

[Lectio8]
Behold, your house is left unto you desolate. God had already spoken these~
things once before, by the mouth of Jeremiah, where He saith I have forsaken~
Mine house, I have left Mine heritage; Mine inheritance is become unto Me like~
an hyaenás den. (xii. 7.) The house of the Jews, which was to be left unto~
them desolate, is that Temple, whose splendour they loved only too well, when~
they slew the Owner of it for the sake of it, and said of Christ, This is the~
heir; come, let us kill Him, and the inheritance shall be ours. ( Matth. xxi.~
38.)

[Lectio9]
I say unto you, Ye shall not see Me henceforth, till ye shall say Blessed is~
he that cometh in the name of the Lord. Here He speaketh to Jerusalem and to the~
Jewish people. The words, Blessed is He That cometh in the name of the Lord,~
were indeed spoken by babes and sucklings when the Saviour entered Jerusalem in~
triumph, and they that went before and they that followed, cried, saying, '~
Blessed is He That cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest,'~
~(Mark xi. 9,) but they are originally taken from Psalm cxvii. 26. -Which Psalm~
is all evidently written in honour of the coniing of our Lord.
