[Oratio]
O God, Who didst choose the blessed Raymond to be an eminent minister of the~
Sacrament of Penance, and in a wonderful manner didst make him to pass over the~
waves of the sea, grant unto us, at his petition, the grace to bring forth~
fruits worthy of repentance, and in the end to attain unto the harbour of~
eternal salvation.

O Lord, we pray thee that thy blessed handmaiden and witness Emerentiana in whom~
Thou hast ever been well pleased, because of her worthy maidenhood and her~
mighty showing-forth of thy power, may entreat thy pardon on our behalf.

[Lectio4]
The blessed Raymond was born at Barcelona, (in the year of our Lord 1175,) and~
was of the noble family of the De PeKafuerte. He was early instructed in the~
Christian religion, and even while he was still a little child, he showed such~
excellence of mind and body, as filled his friends with strong hopes of his~
future greatness. As a young man he taught letters in his native place. He~
afterwards went to Bologna, where he applied himself to works of godliness, and~
to the study of the Ecclesiastical and Civil Law. He took the degree of Doctor,~
and lectured with great applause upon the Canon Law. He attained so much~
celebrity that Berengar, Bishop of Barcelona, on his way from Rome to his own~
See, turned aside to visit the Saint at Bologna, and at length persuaded him~
after many entreaties to return with him to Spain. He was appointed to a Canonry~
and the Archdeaconry in the Church of Barcelona, in which offices he set both~
clergy and people a brilliant example of uprightness, modesty, learning, and~
meekness, and more especially strove, as far as in him lay, to increase the~
honour and reverence paid to the Virgin Mother of God, whom he venerated with an~
affection singularly devoted.

[Lectio5]
When he was about forty-five years of age he solemnly professed in the Order of~
Friars Preachers, and strove, as a new recruit, to perfect himself in all the~
duties of his calling, particularly in charity to the poor, and above all to~
those unhappy Christians who were slaves to the unbelievers. He was the~
Confessor of St Peter Nolasco and of James I., King of Aragon, and by his advice~
St Peter Nolasco gave up his whole worldly possessions to ransom as many as~
possible of the wretched captives. At this moment the most blessed Virgin~
appeared simultaneously to St Raymond, St Peter Nolasco, and King James, and~
revealed to them the pleasure of her Only-begotten Son and herself, that they~
should establish in her honour an order of Religious persons whose work should~
be the redemption of Christian slaves from bondage among unbelievers. The three~
took counsel together, and then founded the Order of the Blessed Mary of Ransom,~
for the Redemption of Captives. The blessed Raymond himself composed a most~
appropriate code of rules for the new institution, for which he after some years~
obtained the express sanction of Pope Gregory IX., and himself (on the ioth day~
of August, in the year 1223,) with his own hands clothed St Peter Nolasco in the~
habit, and constituted him the first Master General of the Order.

[Lectio6]
He was summoned to Rome by Gregory IX., (in the year 1230,) and appointed by him~
his Chaplain, Penitentiary, and Confessor, and by his orders collected into one~
volume of the Decretals the ordinances of the Roman Pontiffs, which up to that~
time were only to be found scattered among the records of divers Councils and~
Churches. He firmly refused the Archbishopric of Tarascon, which was offered him~
by the Pope himself, and, having been chosen Master General of the whole order~
of Friars Preachers, he discharged the duties of that office in holiness for two~
years, and then resigned it. It was by his advice that James, King of Aragon,~
established the Office of the Holy Inquisition in his dominions. He was~
distinguished by many miracles, of which the chief which is narrated of him is~
that on one occasion being in the island of Majorca and wishing to go to~
Barcelona, he spread his cloak upon the sea, and passed over the waters on it,~
accomplishing the whole distance of sixty leagues in six hours, and finally~
entering his convent through the closed doors. He attained the age of nearly an~
hundred years, and fell asleep in the Lord (on the 6th day of January,) in the~
year of salvation 1275. His name was enrolled by Clement VIII. among those of~
the Saints.

[Lectio93]
!Commemoration for St Emerentiana.
Emerentiana was a Roman maiden, and the foster-sister of the blessed Agnes.~
While she was still a Catechumen she was inspired by her faith and love to~
rebuke the fury of the idol-worshippers against the Christians, whereupon a mob~
assembled, and stoned her so severely that she was only able to drag herself to~
the grave of holy Agnes, where, while she prayed, she gave up her soul to God,~
being baptized, not in water, but in her own blood, so freely shed for Christ.

[Lectio94]
Raymund of Barcelona, of the noble family of Pennafort, zealously applied himself at Bologna to works of charity and to the study of ecclesiastical and civil law.  When he had received his doctorate, he taught there, gaining great praise for interpreting the sacred canons.  Soon Bishop Berengarius honoured him with the offices of canon and provost of the church of Barcelona, and he gave a shining example by his virtue, teaching and gentle ways, also striving with all his power to promote the cult of the Virgin Mother of God.  At the age of forty-five, he was professed in the Order of Friars Preachers.  It was at his instigation that St. Peter Nolasco, who was his penitent, together with James I, King of Aragon, founded the Order of Our Lady of Mercy for the Redemption of Captives, and Raymund himself drew up admirable rules for its way of life.  At the command of Gregory IX, he was summoned to Rome to collect the decrees of the various popes into one volume, called the Decretals.  He consistently refused the archbishoprick of Tarragona, and he resigned the office of master general of the Order of Preachers after exercising it in a most holy manner for two years.  He was nearly an hundred years old when he fell asleep in the Lord in 1275.  Clement VIII enrolled his name among those of the Saints.
