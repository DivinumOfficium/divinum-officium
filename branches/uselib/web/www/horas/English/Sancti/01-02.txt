Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Romans
!Rom 5:1-5
 5:1 BEING justified therefore by faith, let us have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ:
5:2 By whom also we have access through faith into this grace, wherein we stand, and glory in the hope of the glory of the sons of God.
5:3 And not only so; but we glory also in tribulations, knowing that tribulation worketh patience;
5:4 And patience trial; and trial hope;
5:5 And hope confoundeth not: because the charity of God is poured forth in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost, who is given to us.

[Lectio2]
!Rom 5:6-9
5:6 For why did Christ, when as yet we were weak, according to the time, die for the ungodly?
5:7 For scarce for a just man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man some one would dare to die.
5:8 But God commendeth his charity towards us; because when as yet we were sinners, according to the time,
5:9 Christ died for us; much more therefore, being now justified by his blood, shall we be saved from wrath through him.

[Lectio3]
!Rom 5:10-12
5:10 For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son; much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.
5:11 And not only so; but also we glory in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received reconciliation.
5:12 Wherefore as by one man sin entered into this world, and by sin death; and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned.

From the Sermons of St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!2nd on St Stephen.
Christ, the Captain of the Martyrs, hath first suffered for us, leaving us an~
example that we should follow His steps, (i Pet. ii. 21.) And truly, Blessed~
Stephen followed them, when, having confessed Christ, he was stoned to death by~
the Jews, and obtained the crown which his name had foreshown. For the meaning~
of the Greek name Stephanos is a crown. Already he had a crown for his name, a~
foreshadowing of the martyr's palm which he beareth in heaven. Then they stoned him he did not rejoice at the thought that God would take~
vengeance on his persecutors. On the contrary, he prayed that they might be~
forgiven.

From the Sermons of St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!2nd on St Stephen.
Even after the glory of yesterday, bright with the splendour of Christ our~
Saviour's Birth, this day findeth itself an illumination of its own from the~
crown of the blessed Martyr Stephen. The whole earth knoweth how manfully he~
fought and conquered for he suffered at the very fountain-head of the Church,~
that is to say, in Jerusalem. It was in the Church there that he ministered as a~
Deacon and in the youthful springtime of life dyed with his blood the lily of~
his purity. His Passion is very glorious, and many ways wonderful, and when we~
read it in the Acts of the Apostles, we seem rather to see than to hear.

Then they stoned him he did not rejoice at the thought that God would take~
vengeance on his persecutors. On the contrary, he prayed that they might be~
forgiven. For he remembered the word of the Lord, that saith Vengeance~
belongeth unto Me, I will recompense, saith the Lord, (Heb. x. 30,) and again:~
Say not thou; I will recompense evil to mine enemies, but wait on the Lord,~
and He shall save thee. (Prov. xx. 22.) The Lord God biddeth us also be patient,~
knowing that in the great day of retribution, we, as well as His holy martyrs,~
shall be righted.

From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 23:34-35
In that time Jesus said to the scribes and Pharisee: Behold I send to you~
prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them you will put to death and~
crucify. And so on.
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Bk. iv. Comment, on Matth. xxiii.
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the Prophets. The Jerusalem that~
killed the Prophets was not the material stone and houses, but they that dwelt~
therein. He wept over her with a father's love, as also it is written in another~
place that, when He saw the city, He wept over it. (Luke xix. 41.) How often~
would I have gathered thy children together. Here observe that Christ avoweth~
that He had been the Sender of all the former Prophets. Even as an hen gathereth~
her chickens under her wings. A similar figure is found in the Song of Moses in~
Deuteronomy, xxxii. II, As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her~
young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, and beareth them on her wings.

[Lectio8]
Behold, your house is left unto you desolate. God had already spoken these~
things once before, by the mouth of Jeremiah, where He saith I have forsaken~
Mine house, I have left Mine heritage; Mine inheritance is become unto Me like~
an hyaena's den. (xii. 7.) The house of the Jews, which was to be left unto~
them desolate, is that Temple, whose splendour they loved only too well, when~
they slew the Owner of it for the sake of it, and said of Christ, This is the~
heir; come, let us kill Him, and the inheritance shall be ours. ( Matth. xxi.~
38.)

[Lectio9]
I say unto you, Ye shall not see Me henceforth, till ye shall say Blessed is~
he that cometh in the name of the Lord. Here He speaketh to Jerusalem and to the~
Jewish people. The words, Blessed is He That cometh in the name of the Lord,~
were indeed spoken by babes and sucklings when the Saviour entered Jerusalem in~
triumph, and they that went before and they that followed, cried, saying, '~
Blessed is He That cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest,'~
~(Mark xi. 9,) but they are originally taken from Psalm cxvii. 26. -Which Psalm~
is all evidently written in honour of the coniing of our Lord.

O Almighty and everlasting God, Who hast dedicated the first-fruits of thy~
Martyrs with the blood of the Blessed Stephen; grant, we beseech thee, that the~
same may pray for us also, who prayed even for his murderers
