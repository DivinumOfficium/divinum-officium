[Hymnus Vespera]
v. Christ, of the angels praise and adoration,
Father and Saviour thou, of every nation,
Graciously grant us all to gain a station,
Where thou art reigning.
_
Angel of strength, who triumphed, tumults quelling,
Gabriel send us, ancient foes expelling,
Oft in these temples may he make his dwelling,
Dear unto heaven.
_
May the fair Mother of the Light be o'er us,
Virgin of peace, with all the angel chorus,
And may the heavenly army go before us,
Guiding and guarding.

O may the Godhead, endless bliss possessing,
Father, Son, Spirit, grant to us this blessing;
All his creation joins his praise confessing,
Now and forever.
Amen.

Lesson from the book of Daniel
!Dan 9:20-23
20 Now while I was yet speaking, and praying, and confessing my sins, and the~
sins of my people of Israel, and presenting my supplications in the sight of my~
God, for the holy mountain of my God:
21 As I was yet speaking in prayer, behold the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in~
the vision at the beginning, flying swiftly touched me at the time of the~
evening sacrifice.
22 And he instructed me, and spoke to me, and said: O Daniel, I am now come~
forth to teach thee, and that thou mightest understand.
23 From the beginning of thy prayers the word came forth: and I am come to show~
it to thee, because thou art a man of desires: therefore do thou mark the word,~
and understand the vision.

[Responsory1]

!Dan 9:24-25
24 Seventy weeks are shortened upon thy people, and upon thy holy city, that~
transgression may be finished, and sin may have an end, and iniquity may be~
abolished; and everlasting justice may be brought; and vision and prophecy may~
be fulfilled; and the saint of saints may be anointed.
25 Know thou therefore, and take notice: that from the going forth of the word,~
to build up Jerusalem again, unto Christ the prince, there shall be seven weeks,~
and sixty-two weeks: and the street shall be built again, and the walls in~
straitness of times.

[Responsory2]
R. And Gabriel talked with Daniel, and said : At the beginning of thy~
supplications the commandment came forth
* And I am come to show thee, for thou art greatly beloved. (Alleluia.)
V. Therefore consider the matter and understand the vision.
R. And I am come to show thee, for thou art greatly beloved. (Alleluia.)

[Lectio3]
!Dan 9:26-27
26 And after sixty-two weeks Christ shall be slain: and the people that shall~
deny him shall not be his. And a people with their leader that shall come, shall~
destroy the city and the sanctuary: and the end thereof shall be waste, and~
after the end of the war the appointed desolation.
27 And he shall confirm the covenant with many, in one week: and in the half of~
the week the victim and the sacrifice shall fall: and there shall be in the~
temple the abomination of desolation: and the desolation shall continue even to~
the consummation, and to the end.

[Responsory3]
R. Behold, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning,~

[Lectio4]
From the Sermons of St Bernard, Abbat (of Clairvaux.)
!On Luke i. 26.
The Angel Gabriel was sent from God.I opine that this Angel is not one of those~
lesser ones who are often sent to earth with messages upon one occasion and~
another. This may well be understood from his name, which signifieth the strong~
-man -of- God, and because it is especially said that he was sent, not by some~
spirit haply more excellent than he, but from God Himself. It is said from God~
lest it should be imagined that God had revealed His counsel to any of the~
blessed spirits before revealing it to the Virgin, except to the Archangel~
Gabriel, who is thus discovered to possess such an excellency in the heavenly~
host as becomes at once his name and his message.

[Responsory4]
R. It came to pass that while Zacharias executed the Priest's office before God,~
in the order of his course
* There appeared unto him the Angel Gabriel, standing on the right side of the~
Altar of incense. (Alleluia.)
V. When he went into the temple of the Lord to burn incense, according to the~
custom of the Priest's office.
R. There appeared unto him the Angel Gabriel, standing on the right side of the~
Altar of incense. (Alleluia.)

[Lectio5]
Either do his name and his message disagree, for whom did it more beseem to be~
the herald of Christ, the Power of God, (i Cor. i. 24,) than him who was~
honoured by bearing a like name? For power and strength are much the same.~
Neither doth it appear unmeet or unseemly that the Lord and His messenger should~
have a like title, when we consider that that title differeth in meaning in~
each. Christ is called the Power or Strength of God in a sense very different to~
that in which the like appellation is given to the Angel. In the Angel it is a~
bestowed title; in Christ, an essential description.

[Responsory5]
R. The Angel Gabriel came down unto Zacharias, and said unto him :
* Fear not; for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a~
son, and thou shalt call his name John. (Alleluia.)
V. And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him; but the~
Angel said unto him
R. Fear not; for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a~
son, and thou shalt call his name John. (Alleluia.)

[Lectio6]
Christ is called, and absolutely the Power of God. When the strong man armed~
kept his palace, and all his goods were in peace, Christ came upon him as One~
stronger than he, and overcame him by the strength of His Own arm, and took from~
him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divided his spoils. (Luke xi. 21,~
22.) But the Angel is called the strongman-of-God, either because this title was~
his right as the herald of the Power of God, or because it was his mission to~
comfort the Virgin, naturally fearful, simple, and shame-faced, lest she should~
be beside herself with terror at the newness of the miracle, which office indeed~
he discharged when he said: Fear not, Mary; for thou hast found grace with God.~
Meetly therefore was Gabriel chosen for this work, or rather, meetly was his~
name given him since he had been so chosen.

[Responsory6]
R. I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto~
thee, and to show thee these glad tidings.
* Behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these~
things shall be performed. (Alleluia.)
V. Because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their~
season.
R. Behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these~
things shall be performed. (Alleluia.)
&Gloria
R. Behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these~
things shall be performed. (Alleluia.)

[Lectio7]
From the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 1:26-38
At that time : The Angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named~
Nazareth, to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of~
David : and the Virgin's name was Mary. And so on.
_
Homily by St Julian, Archbishop of Toledo.
!2nd against the Jews.
It was from an Angel that Daniel learnt the secret of the seventy weeks until~
the birth of the Christ; it was by the apparition of an Angel that Zacharias~
heard that he was about to beget a son; and it was when an Angel foretold that~
the Christ should be born of her, that Mary believed and consented. These three~
things we see announced by an Angel, and fulfilled. Let us now then look~
carefully whether the Angel who appeared to Zacharias and Mary was the same who~
had foretold these same things to Daniel.

[Responsory7]
R. The Angel Gabriel was sent to Mary, the virgin espoused to Joseph, and the~
Virgin was afraid of the light.
* Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found grace with the Lord. Behold, thou shalt~
conceive and bring forth a Son, and He shall be called the Son of the Highest.~
~(Alleluia.)
V. And when she heard it, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind~
what manner of salutation this should be. And the Angel said unto her :
R. Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found grace with the Lord. Behold, thou shalt~
conceive, and bring forth a Son, and He shall be called the Son of the Highest.~
~(Alleluia.)

[Lectio8]
As for Daniel, he, in the Book of his Prophecy, when he learnt from the Angel~
the mystery of the seventy weeks, which should mark the date of the Birth of~
Christ, plainly expresseth the name of the said Angel. For he saith : Behold,~
the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused~
to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation; and he~
informed me, and talked with me, and said : O Daniel, I am now come forth to~
give thee skill and understanding. At the beginning of thy supplications the~
commandment came forth, and I am come to show thee, for thou art greatly beloved;~
therefore consider the matter, and so on, as is there narrated. And so, when~
the time pointed at drew near, we find in the Gospel the wondrous name of this~
same Angel. For the Angel said unto Zacharias : I am Gabriel, that stand in the~
presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to show thee these glad~
tidings. 

[Lectio9]
And this is also the name which we read in the Gospel~
where the child-bearing of the BlessedVirgin Mary is spoken of, as it is written :~
The Angel Gabriel was sent from God, unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, to a~
virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the~
virgin's name was Mary. We see then that it was the one and the same Angel~
Gabriel who revealed to Daniel the time prefixed for the Birth of Christ, and~
who announced the delivery of the Virgin when the time came. He cometh at the~
very time which he himself had foretold, and showeth by actual demonstration the~
fulfilment of his former word, faithful in the prophecy of the weeks, faithful~
in the revelation of the mystery.

[Responsory8]
R. Rejoice, O Mary, by whose mighty hand the Church hath victory o'er her foes~
achieved
* Since thou to Gabriel's word of quickening power in lowliness hast listened~
and believed thou, still a virgin, in thy blessed womb hast God Incarnate of thy~
flesh conceived, and, still of heaven, of that virginity remainest after~
childbirth unbereaved. (Alleluia.)
V. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.
R. Since thou to Gabriel's word of quickening power in lowliness hast listened~
and believed thou, still a virgin, in thy blessed womb hast God Incarnate of thy~
flesh conceived, and, still of heaven, of that virginity remainest after~
childbirth unbereaved. (Alleluia.)
&Gloria
R. Since thou to Gabriel's word of quickening power in lowliness hast listened~

O CHRIST, Redeemer of mankind,
Thy servants here protect and spare,
Who hearest with a loving mind
The Blessed Virgin's holy prayer.
_
Be ever present, Angel high,
Whose name God's might doth signify;
To all the weak new strength impart,
And solace to the sad of heart.

May those glad hosts which see Thy Face,
The spirits of the heavenly home,
Away from us all evils chase,
Both past, and present, and to come.

Then purge away all unbelief,
From every land where Christians dwell,
That unto Thee, our Victor Chief,
Our thanks and praises we may tell.

And Holy Spirit, with them God,
Now, and while endless ages run.
