!2 Kgs 11:1-3
1 And Athalia the mother of Ochozias seeing that her son was dead, arose, and slew all the royal seed.
2 But Josaba the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ochozias, took Joas the son of Ochozias, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain, out of the bedchamber with his nurse: and hid him from the face of Athalia, so that he was not slain.
3 And he was with her six years hid in the house of the Lord. And Athalia reigned over the land.

4 And in the seventh year Joiada seat, and taking the centurions and the soldiers, brought them in to him into the temple of the Lord, and made a covenant with them: and taking an oath of them in the house of the Lord, showed them the king's son:
5 And he commanded them, saying: This is the thing that you must do:
6 Let a third part of you go in on the sabbath, and keep the watch of the king's house. And let a third part be at the gate of Sur: and let a third part be at the gate behind the dwelling of the shieldbearers: and you shall keep the watch of the house of Messa.
7 But let two parts of you, all that go forth on the sabbath, keep the watch of the house of the Lord about the king.

9 And the centurions did according to all things that Joiada the priest had commanded them: and taking every one their men, that went in on the sabbath, with them that went out on the sabbath, came to Joiada the priest.
10 And he gave them the spears, and the arms of king David, which were in the house of the Lord.
11 And they stood having every one their weapons in their hands, from the right side of the temple, unto the left side of the altar, and of the temple, about the king.
12 And he brought forth the king's son, and put the diadem upon him, and the testimony: and they made him king, and anointed him: and clapping their hands. they said, God save the king.
