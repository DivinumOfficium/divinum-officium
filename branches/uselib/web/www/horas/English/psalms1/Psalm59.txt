59:1 God, thou hast cast us off, and hast destroyed us; * thou hast been angry, and hast had mercy on us.
59:2 Thou hast moved the earth, and hast troubled it: * heal thou the breaches thereof, for it has been moved.
59:3 Thou hast shewn thy people hard things; * thou hast made us drink the wine of sorrow.
59:4 Thou hast given a warning to them that fear thee: * that they may flee from before the bow:
59:5 That thy beloved may be delivered. * Save me with thy right hand, and hear me.
59:6 God hath spoken in his holy place: * I will rejoice, and I will divide Sichem; and will mete out the vale of tabernacles.
59:7 Galaad is mine, and Manasses is mine: * and Ephraim is the strength of my head.
59:8 Juda is my king: * Moab is the pot of my hope.
59:9 Into Edom will I stretch out my shoe: * to me the foreigners are made subject.
59:10 Who will bring me into the strong city? * who will lead me into Edom?
59:11 Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? * and wilt not thou, O God, go out with our armies?
59:12 Give us help from trouble: * for vain is the salvation of man.
59:13 Through God we shall do mightily: * and he shall bring to nothing them that afflict us.
