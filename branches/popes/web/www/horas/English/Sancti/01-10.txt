Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Romans
!Rom 14:1-4
1 NOW him that is weak in faith, take unto you: not in disputes about thoughts.
2 For one believeth that he may eat all things: but he that is weak, let him eat~
herbs.
3 Let not him that eateth, despise him that eateth not: and he that eateth not,~
let him not judge him that eateth. For God hath taken him to him.
4 Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? To his own lord he standeth~
or falleth. And he shall stand: for God is able to make him stand.

!Rom 14:5-8
5 For one judgeth between day and day: and another judgeth every day: let every~
man abound in his own sense.
6 He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord. And he that eateth,~
eateth to the Lord: for he giveth thanks to God. And he that eateth not, to the~
Lord he eateth not, and giveth thanks to God.
7 For none of us liveth to himself; and no man dieth to himself.
8 For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; or whether we die, we die unto the~
Lord. Therefore, whether we live, or whether we die, we are the Lord's.

[Lectio3]
!Rom 14:9-13
9 For to this end Christ died and rose again; that he might be Lord both of the~
dead and of the living.
10 But thou, why judgest thou thy brother? or thou, why dost thou despise thy~
brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
11 For it is written: As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and~
every tongue shall confess to God.
12 Therefore every one of us shall render account to God for himself.
13 Let us not therefore judge one another any more. But judge this rather, that~
you put not a stumblingblock or a scandal in your brother's way.

From the Sermons of St Maximus, Bishop (of Turin.)
!1st on the Epiphany.
Dearly EARLY beloved brethren, we are instructed by the tradition of the Fathers,~
that we have to keep holiday on this solemnity in honour of several joyful~
events. We are taught that on this day, our Lord Christ was, first, manifested~
to the Gentiles by the leading of a star; secondly, that being bidden to a~
marriage, He turned water into wine; and, thirdly, that He received baptism from~
John, whereby He hallowed the waters of the Jordan, and cleansed him that~
baptised Him.

[Lectio5]
Which of these events was the greatest, He knoweth by Whose Will they came to~
pass; for us it is needful to believe and doubt not that whatever was wrought~
was wrought for us. For to the Gentiles is given a hope of worshipping that Very~
God of Very God, to adore Whom the Chaldaeans were led by the rays of a glorious~
star. So also He That by His Will changed water into wine, hath given us to~
drink of the cup of His Blood of the New Testament; and the Lamb of God baptized~
in the Jordan hath hallowed for us that saving Fountain wherein we are born~
again.

[Lectio6]
Therefore, my brethren, as we have lately celebrated with gladness the Festival~
of our Saviour's birth, so now it behoveth us with all earnestness to keep holy~
in His honour, this the birth-day of His wonderworking. And, verily, these three~
anniversaries are rightly on one day preached to us, who acknowledge the~
unspeakable mystery of the Trinity under the name of one God. By these miracles~
the Lord Christ our Redeemer willed to manifest to men some of the power of that~
Godhead, Which in Him lay hidden under the Manhood.

From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 2:1-12
When Jesus therefore was born in Bethlehem of Juda, in the days of king Herod,~
behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem. Saying, Where is he that~
is born king of the Jews? And so on.
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Bk. i. Comm. on Matth. ii.
We have seen His star in the East. In order that the Jews might be confounded by~
hearing from the Gentiles of the birth of Christ, the star rose in the East.~
They knew that it would come, by the prophecy of Balaam, whose successors they~
were. See the Book of Numbers, (xxiv. 17.) The star led the wise men to Judea,~
that the Priests, having it demanded of them where Christ should be born, might~
have no power to plead that they knew not of His coming.

[Lectio8]
And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judea, this is a mistake of copyists. 1~
In our opinion, what the Evangelist wrote must have been, not of Judea, but of~
Judah. Thus it is in the Hebrew text. Nor is there any town called Bethlehem~
among any other people, that this should be called of Judea to distinguish it.~
But it is fitly distinguished as of Judah, because there is in Judea another~
Bethlehem, namely, the one in Galilee. See the Book of Joshua the son of Nun.~
(xix. 15.) Finally, the passage cited, which is in the prophet Micah, (v. 2,)~
hath But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands~
of Judah(, yet out of thee shall He come forth unto me that is to be ruler in~
Israel.)

[Lectio9]
And treasures they presented unto Him gifts, gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.~
The mystic meaning of these gifts is thus neatly expressed by Juvencus the~
Priest, To God made man, born Israel's King, Frankincense, myrrh, and gold~
they bring. And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to~
Herod, they departed into their own country another way. They who had presented~
unto the Lord gifts, were honoured by receiving a warning, not from an Angel,~
but from God Himself; whereas even Joseph was warned only by an Angel. They~
departed into their own country another way, that they might not be brought into~
contact with the unbelief of the Jews.

[Ant 2]
All nations shall come * from afar, bringing their gifts with them. Alleluia.

[Ant 3]
All they from Saba shall come, * they shall bring gold and Incense. Alleluia,~
Alleluia.
