Here beginneth Prophet Nahum
!Nah 1:1-4
1  The burden of Ninive. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elcesite.
2  The Lord is a jealous God, and a revenger: the Lord is a revenger, and hath wrath: the Lord taketh vengeance on his adversaries, and he is angry with his enemies.
3  The Lord is patient, and great in power, and will not cleanse and acquit the guilty. The Lord's ways are in a tempest, and a whirlwind, and clouds are the dust of his feet.
4  He rebuketh the sea, and drieth it up: and bringeth all the rivers to be a desert. Basan languisheth and Carmel: and the dower of Libanus fadeth away.

!Nah 1:4-6
4  He rebuketh the sea, and drieth it up: and bringeth all the rivers to be a desert. Basan languisheth and Carmel: and the dower of Libanus fadeth away.
5  The mountains tremble at him, and the hills are made desolate: and the earth hath quaked at his presence, and the world, and all that dwell therein.
6  Who can stand before the face of his indignation? and who shall resist in the fierceness of his anger? his indignation is poured out like fire: and the rocks are melted by him.

!Nah 1:7-10
7  The Lord is good and giveth strength in the day of trouble: and knoweth them that hope in him.
8  But with a flood that passeth by, he will make an utter end of the place thereof: and darkness shall pursue his enemies.
9  What do ye devise against the Lord? he will make an utter end: there shall not rise a double affliction.
10  For as thorns embrace one another: so while they are feasting and drinking together, they shall be consumed as stubble that is fully dry.
