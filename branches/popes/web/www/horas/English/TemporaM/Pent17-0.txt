From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 22:34-46
At that time the Pharisees came unto Jesus, and one of them, which was a~
lawyer, asked Him a question, tempting Him, saying Master, which is the great~
commandment in the Law And so on.
_
Homily by St John Chrysostom, Patriarch (of Constantinople.)
!72nd on Matthew.
When the Pharisees had heard that Christ had put the Sadducees to silence, they~
gathered themselves together for a fresh attack just when it behoved them to~
be quiet, they willed to contend and so they put forward one of themselves who~
professed skill in the law, not wishing to learn, but to lay a snare. This~
person therefore proposed the question: "Which is the great commandment in the~
law " The first and great commandment is " Thou shalt love the Lord thy God,"~
but they expected that He would make some exception or addition to this in His~
Own case, since He made Himself God. (John x. 33.) With this expectation they~
asked Him the question but what said Christ To show that they had adopted~
this course, because they were loveless, and sick with envy, He answered "Thou~
shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with~
all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like~
unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."

[Lectio8]
Why is this second commandment like unto the first Because the first is the~
second's source and sanction. " For every one that doeth evil hateth the light,~
neither cometh to the light." (John iii. 20.) And again " The fool hath said~
in his heart There is no God " and there followeth " They are corrupt, and~
become abominable in their works." (Ps. xiii. 1.) And yet again: "The love of~
money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after, they have erred~
from the faith." (1 Tim. vi. 10.) And yet once more: " If ye love Me, keep My~
commandments," (John xiv. 15,) of which commandments the head and root is "~
Thou shalt love the Lord thy God and thy neighbour as thyself."

[Lectio9]
If therefore, to love God is to love our neighbour also, (as it appeared! where~
it is written " Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou Me And he said unto Him~
Lord, Thou knowest all things Thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto~
him Feed My sheep," John xxi. 17,) and if "love is the fulfilling of the law,"~
(Rom. xiii. 10,) justly doth the Lord say that "on these two commandments hang~
all the law and the Prophets." And even as when, before this, (23-32,) being~
interrogated about the Resurrection, He answered them more than they asked, so,~
now, being interrogated concerning the first and great commandment, He answereth~
them, of His own accord, touching that second one also, which is little lower~
than the first, for " the second is like unto it." Herein He would have them~
understand that it was hatred stirred them up to question Him. For " Charity,"~
saith the Apostle, " envieth not." (1 Cor. xiii. 4.)

[Ant 2]
Master, which is the great commandment * in the law? Jesus said unto him Thou~
shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart. Alleluia.

[Versum 2]
V. The Lord reigneth He is clothed with majesty.
R. The Lord is clothed with strength, and hath girded Himself with power.

[Ant 3]
What think ye of Christ Whose Son is He * They say all unto Him The Son of~
David. Jesus saith unto them How then doth David in spirit call Him Lord,~
saying, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou at My right hand

[Versum 3]
V. Let my prayer, O Lord, be set forth.
R. As incense before thee.

Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 22:34-46
22:34 But the Pharisees hearing that he had silenced the Sadducees, came together:
22:35 And one of them, a doctor of the law, asking him, tempting him:
22:36 Master, which is the greatest commandment in the law?
22:37 Jesus said to him: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, and with thy whole mind.
22:38 This is the greatest and the first commandment.
22:39 And the second is like to this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
22:40 On these two commandments dependeth the whole law and the prophets.
22:41 And the Pharisees being gathered together, Jesus asked them,
22:42 Saying: What think you of Christ? whose son is he? They say to him: David's.
22:43 He saith to them: How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying:
22:44 The Lord said to my Lord, Sit on my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool?
22:45 If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?
22:46 And no man was able to answer him a word; neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.
