[Ant Vespera]
How wonderful is the dealing here! * The Maker of man hath taken to Himself a living body, and hath been pleased to be born of the Virgin He is come forth conceived without seed, and hath made us partakers of His Divine natur;;109
When, in an unspeakable manner, * Thou wast born of a Virgin, the Scriptures were fulfilled; to save man, Thou earnest down as dew upon the fleece we praise thee, O our God!;;112
Mother of God, when Moses * saw the bush unconsumed, we own that it was a figure of the preservation of thy most wonderful virginity pray for us;;121
The Root of Jesse hath blossomed * the star is arisen out of Jacob, the Virgin hath given birth to the Saviour we praise thee, O our God!;;126
Behold, Mary hath borne * for us a Saviour; John beheld Him and cried, saying Behold, the Lamb of God, behold Him that taketh away the sins of the world. Alleluia.;;147

[Ant 1]
The old man held his Lord * in his arms in the form of a little child, but the~
Child was the old man's King even that Child whom a virgin bore, and remained a~
virgin as before the fruit of her womb, and the God of her soul.

Olvasmány Mózes második könyvébõl
!Exod 13:1-3; 13:11-13
1 Az Úr így szólt Mózeshez:
2 "Szentelj nekem minden elsõszülöttet. Ami Izraelben anyja méhét megnyitja -~
akár ember, akár állat -, az mind az enyém."
3 Mózes így beszélt a néphez: "Emlékezzetek meg errõl a napról, amelyen~
kijöttetek Egyiptomból, a szolgaság házából. Az Úr erõs kézzel hozott ki onnan~
benneteket. Ezért nem ehettek semmiféle kovászosat.
11 Ha majd az Úr bevezet a kánaániak földjére, és neked adja azt, amelyet~
esküvel megígért neked és atyáidnak,
12 akkor majd szenteld mindazt az Úrnak, ami az anyja méhét megnyitja. Az~
állatok elsõszülöttei közül is a hímnemû az Úré.
13 Minden szamárnak az elsõszülöttét egy báránnyal kell megváltanod. Ha nem~
váltod meg, törd el a nyakát. Az emberek elsõszülöttét, ha fiú, meg kell~
váltanod.

[Responsory1]
R. Make ready thy chamber, O Zion, to receive Christ thy King
* Even that Child Whom a Virgin bore, and remained a Virgin as before the fruit~
of her womb and the God of her soul.
V. Simeon took the Child up in his arms, and blessed God.
R. Even that Child Whom a Virgin bore, and remained a Virgin as before the fruit~
of her womb and the God of her soul.

De libro Levitici.
!Lev 12:1-5
1 Az Úr azt mondta Mózesnek:
2 "Hirdesd ki Izrael fiainak. Ha az asszony szül, és a gyermeke fiú, akkor hét~
napig tisztátalannak számít, mint ahogy tisztátalan havi vérzése idején.
3 A nyolcadik napon metéljék körül a gyermek elõbõrét.
4 De õ még harminchárom napig maradjon otthon, hogy megtisztuljon vérétõl. Ne~
érintsen semmit, ami szent, és ne közeledjen a szentélyhez, amíg le nem telt~
tisztulásának ideje.
5 Ha leánygyermeket szül, maradjon tisztátalan két hétig, éppúgy, mint havi~
vérzése idején, és még hatvanhat napig maradjon otthon, hogy megtisztuljon~
vérétõl.

[Responsory2]
R. When the days of Mary's purification according to the law of Moses were~
accomplished, they brought Jesus to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord;
* As it is written in the law of the Lord Every male that openeth the womb shall~
be called holy unto the Lord.
V. They offered for Him unto the Lord a pair of turtle-doves or two young~
pigeons.
R. As it is written in the law of the Lord Every male that openeth the womb~
shall be called holy unto the Lord.

!Lev 12:6-8
6 Amikor letelt tisztulásának ideje - akár fiúról, akár leányról van szó -,~
vigyen a papnak a megnyilatkozás sátorának bejáratához egy egyéves bárányt~
égõáldozatul és egy galambot vagy gerlét bûnért való áldozatul.
7 Ezt a pap áldozza fel az Úr elõtt. Így végezze el fölötte az engesztelés~
szertartását, s akkor megtisztul vérének folyásától. Ez az asszonyra vonatkozó~
elõírás, aki fiút vagy leányt szül.
8 Ha nincs annyi pénze, hogy egy bárányt vegyen, akkor hozzon két gerlét vagy~
két galambot: egyet égõáldozatnak, egyet pedig bûnért való áldozatnak. A pap~
végezze el fölötte az engesztelés szertartását, s akkor megtisztul."

[Responsory3]
R. They offered for Him unto the Lord a pair of turtle-doves, or two young~
pigeons

From the Sermons of St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!13th on the Season.
In old time it was written: And of Zion shall it not be said This and that man~
was bom in her, and the Highest Himself shall establish her? Blessed be the~
omnipotence of Him That was born! Blessed the glory of Him That came from heaven~
to earth! While yet He was borne in His Mother's womb, He was saluted by John~
the Baptist; He was presented in the temple, and recognised by that famous,~
antient, and glorious worthy, the old man Simeon. As soon as he knew Him he~
worshipped Him, and said Lord, now lettest Thou thy servant depart in peace for~
mine eyes have seen thy Salvation.

[Responsory4]
R. Simeon was just and devout, waiting for the redemption of Israel
* And the Holy Ghost was upon him.
V. It was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death,~
before he had seen the Lord's Christ.
R. And the Holy Ghost was upon him.

[Lectio5]
She lingered in the world to see the birth of Him Who made the world. The old~
man knew the Child, and in that Child became a child himself, for in the love~
wherewith he regarded the Father of all, he felt his own years to be but as of~
yesterday. The old man Simeon bore the new-born Christ, and all the while,~
Christ was the old man's Lord. It had been told him by the Lord that he should~
not taste of death before he had seen the birth of the Lord's Christ. Now Christ~
is born, and all the old man's wishes on earth are fulfilled. He That came to a~
decrepit world came to an old man.

[Responsory5]
R. It was revealed unto Simeon by the Holy Ghost that he should not see death~
before he had seen the Lord's Christ
* And he blessed God, and said Lord, now lettest Thou thy servant depart in~
peace, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation.
V. When His parents brought in the Child Jesus, to do for Him after the custom~
of the law then took he Him up in his arms.
R. And blessed God, and said Lord, now lettest Thou thy servant depart in peace,~
for mine eyes have seen thy salvation.

[Lectio6]
He wished not to remain long in the world, but he longed to see Christ in the~
world, singing with the Prophet, and saying Shew us thy mercy, O Lord, and grant~
us thy salvation. (Ps. lxxxiv. 8.) And now at last, that ye may know that the~
cause of his joy was that this prayer was granted, he saith Now lettest Thou thy~
servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation. The Prophets~
have sung that the Maker of heaven and earth would converse on earth with men an~
angel hath declared that the Creator of flesh and spirit would come in the flesh~
the unborn John, yet in the womb, hath saluted the unborn Saviour yet in the~
womb. The old man Simeon hath seen God a little Child.

[Responsory6]
R. When His parents brought the Child Jesus into the temple, to do for Him after~
the custom of the law, Simeon took Him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said
* Lord, now lettest Thou thy servant depart in peace.
V. Simeon took up the Child in his arms, and cried out, and said
R. Lord, now lettest Thou thy servant depart in peace.
&Gloria
R. Lord, now lettest Thou thy servant depart in peace.

Evangélium szent Lukács Evangélista kõnyvébõl
!Luke 2:22-32
Azon idõben amikor elteltek a tisztulásnak a Mózes törvényében megszabott napjai,~
felvitték Jeruzsálembe, hogy bemutassák az Úrnak, ahogy az Úr törvényében elõ~
volt írva. És így tovább.
_
Homily on this passage by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!Bk. 2, Comm. on Luke ii.
And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and the same~
man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel. The birth of the~
Lord is attested not only by Angels and Prophets, and shepherds, but also by~
elders and just men. Every age, and both sexes, as well as the miracles of the~
events themselves, are here to strengthen our faith. A virgin conceiveth, a~
barren woman beareth, a dumb man speaketh, Elizabeth prophesieth, the wise~
man worshippeth, the unborn child leapeth, the widow praiseth, and the just man~
waiteth.

[Responsory7]
R. Simeon took Jesus up in his arms, and cried out, and said
* Verily Thou art a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the Glory of thy people~
Israel.
V. When His parents brought in the Child Jesus, then took he Him up in his arms,~
and blessed God, and said
R. Verily Thou art a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the Glory of thy people~
Israel.

[Lectio8]
Well is he called just, who looked not for favour for himself, but for~
consolation for his people. He desired to be set free from the bondage of this~
frail body, but he waited to see the Promised One for he knew that blessed are~
the eyes that see Him. Then took he Him up in his arms, and blessed God, and~
said Lord, now lettest Thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word.~
Behold a just man, confined in the weary prison of the body, desiring to be~
dissolved and to begin to be with Christ. For to be dissolved and to be with~
Christ is much better. (Phil. i. 23.)

[Responsory8]
R. The old man bore the Child, but the Child was the old man's King;
* Even that Child Whom a virgin bore, and remained a virgin as before; and when~
that virgin had brought Him into the world, she fell down and worshipped Him.
V. Simeon took the Child up in his arms, and gave thanks, and blessed the Lord.
R. Even that Child Whom a virgin bore, and remained a virgin as before; and when~
that virgin had brought Him into the world, she fell down and worshipped Him.
&Gloria
R. Even that Child Whom a virgin bore, and remained a virgin as before; and when~
that virgin had brought Him into the world, she fell down and worshipped Him.

[Lectio9]
Whosoever will be dissolved and be with Christ, let him come into the Temple,~
let him come to Jerusalem, let him wait for the Lord's Christ, let him take hold~
on the Word of God, let him embrace it with good works, as it were with arms of~
faith and then let him depart in peace, for he shall not see death, who hath~
seen life. Behold how the Lord's Birth doth overflow with abounding grace for~
all, and prophecy is not denied to the just, but to the unbelieving. Behold,~
Simeon prophesieth that the Lord Jesus Christ is come for the fall and rising~
again of many yea, He shall separate the just from the unjust by their deserts,~
and according as our work shall be, so shall the true and righteous Judge~
command us to be punished or rewarded.
