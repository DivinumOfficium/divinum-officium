[Lectio]
Lesson from the book of Proverbs
!Prov 8:22-24, 32-35.
Lord begot me, the firstborn of His ways, the forerunner of His prodigies of long ago; from of old I was poured forth, at the first, before the earth. When there were no depths I was brought forth. So now, O children, listen to me; happy those who keep my ways. Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not. Happy the man who obeys me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at my doorposts; for he who finds me finds life, and wins favor from the Lord.

[Graduale]
!Ps 44:5, 11-12.
In the cause of truth and mercy and for the sake of justice: may your right hand~
show you wondrous deeds.
V. Hear, O daughter, and see; turn your ear; for the King shall desire your~
beauty. Alleluia, alleluia.
V. The solemnity of the glorious Virgin Mary, of the seed of Abraham, sprung~
from the tribe of Juda, of the noble line of David. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 1:26-38
 At that time, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee called~
Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph, of the house of David,~
and the virgin’s name was Mary. And when the angel had come to her, he said,~
Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women. When~
she had heard him she was troubled at his word, and kept pondering what manner~
of greeting this might be. And the angel said to her, Do not be afraid, Mary,~
for you have found grace with God. Behold, you shall conceive in your womb and~
shall bring forth a Son; and you shall call His name Jesus. He shall be great,~
and shall be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give Him the~
throne of David His father, and He shall be king over the house of Jacob forever;~
and of His kingdom there shall be no end. But Mary said to the angel, How shall~
this happen, since I do not know man? And the angel answered and said to her,~
The Holy Spirit shall come upon you, and the power of the Most High shall~
overshadow you; and therefore the Holy One to be born shall be called the Son of~
God. And behold, Elizabeth your kinswoman also has conceived a son in her old~
age, and she who was called barren is now in her sixth month; for nothing shall~
be impossible with God. But Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it~
done to me according to your word.

[Offertorium]
!Ecclus 24:25; 39:17
In me is all grace of the way and of the truth, in me is all hope of life and of~
virtue. Like a rose planted near running waters I have borne fruit.

[Secreta]
Grant us, we beseech You, O Lord, to be properly prepared to offer these gifts,~
and, through the mysteries of the most holy Rosary, so to keep in mind the life,~
passion and glory of Your only-begotten Son, that we may be made worthy of His~
promises.
$Qui tecum

[Communio]
!Ecclus 39:19
Break forth in blossoms like the lily, and yield a smell, and bring forth leaves~
in grace, and praise with canticles, and bless the Lord in His works.

[Postcommunio]
May the prayers of Your most holy Mother, whose Rosary we are honoring, help us,~
we beseech You, O Lord, that we may derive strength from the mysteries we~
celebrate and obtain benefit from the sacrament we have received.
