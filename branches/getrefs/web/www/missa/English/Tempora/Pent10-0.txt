Lesson from the first letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians
!1 Cor. 12:2-11
Brethren: You know that when you were Gentiles, you went to dumb idols according as you were led. Wherefore I give you to understand that no one speaking in the Spirit of God, says Anathema to Jesus. And no one can say Jesus is Lord, except in the Holy Spirit. Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are varieties of ministries, but the same Lord; and there are varieties of workings, but the same God, Who works all things in all. Now the manifestation of the Spirit is given to everyone for profit. To one through the Spirit is given the utterance of wisdom; and to another the utterance of knowledge, according to the same Spirit; to another faith, in the same Spirit; to another the gift of healing, in the one Spirit; to another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another the distinguishing of spirits; to another various kinds of tongues; to another interpretation of tongues. But all these things are the work of one and the same Spirit, Who allots to everyone according as He will.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 18:9-14
At that time, Jesus spoke this parable to some who trusted in themselves as~
being just and despised others. Two men went up to the temple to pray, the one a~
Pharisee and the other a publican. The Pharisee stood and began to pray thus~
within himself: ‘O God, I thank You that I am not like the rest of men, robbers,~
dishonest, adulterers, or even like this publican. I fast twice a week; I pay~
tithes of all that I possess.’ But the publican, standing afar off, would not so~
much as lift up his eyes to heaven, but kept striking his breast, saying, ‘O God,~
be merciful to me the sinner!’ I tell you, this man went back to his home~
justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself shall be~
humbled, and he who humbles himself shall be exalted.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 24:1-3
To You I lift up my soul, O Lord. In You, O my God, I trust; let me not be put~
to shame, let not my enemies exult over me. No one who waits for You shall be~
put to shame.

[Secreta]
Let the sacred gifts be offered to You, O Lord, Who have given them to be~
presented for the honor of Your name, for in them You have given us a remedy for~
all our ills.
