Lesson from the book of Revelations
!Rev 21:2-5
In those days, I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, Behold the dwelling of God with men, and He will dwell with them. And they will be His people, and God Himself will be with them as their God. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes. And death shall be no more; neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain any more, for the former things have passed away.And He Who was sitting on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new!

[Evangelium]
Continuation ++ of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 19:1-10
At that time, Jesus entered and was passing through Jericho. And behold there~
was a man named Zacchaeus; and he was a leading publican, and he was rich. And~
he was trying to see Jesus, Who He was, but could not, on account of the crowd,~
because he was small of stature. So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a~
sycamore tree to see Him, for He was going to pass that way. And when Jesus came~
to the place, He looked up and saw him, and said to him, Zacchaeus, make haste~
and come down; for I must stay in your house today.And he made haste and came~
down, and welcomed Him joyfully. And upon seeing it all began to murmur, saying,~
He has gone to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.But Zacchaeus stood and~
said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, I give one-half of my possessions to the poor,~
and if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold. Jesus said to~
him, Today salvation has come to this house, since he, too, is a son of Abraham.~
For the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost.

[Offertorium]
!1 Par 29:17-18
O Lord God, in the simplicity of my heart I have joyfully offered all these~

!In the Mass of Dedication in the act of the Consecration of the Church there is added, under a single conclusion, the prayer of the Mystery or Saint in whose honor the Church or the Oratory is consecrated, and no other commemoration is added, not even a privileged one. After the Solemn Blessing of a Church or Oratory, and after the consecration of the altar, there is said, as a Votive Mass of the Second Class, a Mass of the Mystery or Saint in whose honor the Church or Oratory is blessed or the altar consecrated.
