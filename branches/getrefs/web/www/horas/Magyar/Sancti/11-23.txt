[Lectio4]
Clement, the son of Faustinus, was a Roman, from the quarter of the Coelian~
Mount. He was a disciple of the blessed Peter, and is the same concerning whom~
Paul saith, writing to the Philippians And I entreat thee also, true~
yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the Gospel, with Clement~
also, and with other my fellow-labourers, whose names are written in the book of~
life. (iv. 3.) (He succeeded Cletus as Bishop of Rome.) He it was who divided~
the seven quarters of the city among seven scribes, one to each, whose duty it~
was to search out most carefully, and record in writing the sufferings and acts~
of the Martyrs. He himself also wrote much, and that most orthodox and healthy,~
whereby he clearly explained the Christian Religion.

[Lectio5]
His teaching and the holiness of his life brought many to believe in Christ, and~
he was therefore exiled by the Emperor Trajan to Kherson, in the Crimea, where~
he found two thousand Christians, who had been condemned by the same Trajan.~
There they all worked in the marble quarries. During their labour they suffered~
for want of water, and Clement prayed, and then went up an hill hard by, on the~
top whereof he saw a Lamb standing, touching with its right foot a flowing~
spring of sweet waters. Therewith they all quenched their thirst, and by this~
miracle many unbelievers were brought to believe in Christ, and began to honour~
the holiness of Clement.

[Lectio6]
These things moved Trajan to send a messenger to the Crimea, who tied an~
anchor about Clement's neck, and cast him into the deep of the sea. After it had~
been done, while the Christians were praying on the shore, the sea went back~
three miles, and when they followed it, they found a grotto of marble, in form~
like a temple, and therein a stone coffin wherein was laid the body of the~
Martyr, and, hard by, the anchor wherewith he had been sunk. Then were the~
country people moved to receive the faith of Christ. The body of Clement was~
afterwards brought to Rome, in the time of Pope Nicholas I., and buried in his~
own Church. A Church was also built in the Crimea, in the place where God had~
made the water to break forth. Clement lived as Pope nine years, six months, and~
six days. He held two Ordinations in the month of December, wherein he made ten~
Priests, two Deacons, and fifteen Bishops for divers places.

[Lectio94]
Clemens a Roman and disciple of blessed Peter, assigned each of the seven~
districts of the City to a notary who was to investigate carefully the~
sufferings of the Martyrs and their deeds and to write them down. He himself~
wrote a great deal to explain the Christian religion rightly for the salvation~
of others, Because he was converting many to the faith of Christ by his leaching,~
and the holiness of his life, he was exiled by the emperor Trajan to the~
wilderness near the city of Cherson across the Black Sea. There he found two~
thousand Christians who had been similarly condemned by the emperor. When he had~
converted many nonbelievers in that region to the faith of Christ, at the~
command of the same emperor he was cast into the sea with an anchor tied to his~
neck, and won the crown of martyrdom. His body was later brought to Rome by Pope~
Nicholas I and honorably buried in the Church which has already been dedicated~
to him.

[Lectio93]
!Commemoratio for the Holy Martyr Felicity.
The Lesson is taken from the Sermons of Pope St Gregory (the Great.)
!3rd Horn, on the Gospels.
That blessed woman Felicity, whose Birth-feast we are keeping to-day, had as~
much dread of leaving her seven sons living after her in the flesh, as have~
carnalminded mothers of seeing them go dead before them. When she was taken in~
the strong pains of persecution, she braced up the hearts of her children by~
bidding them cleave to the Fatherland above, and became their mother for the~
spiritual, as she had aforetime been for the fleshly life, bringing them forth~
for God by her exhortation, as she had brought them forth for the world by her~
body. And shall I not call this woman a Martyr? Nay, more than Martyr. The seven~
whom she trusted to God were seven children sent before her to death. She~
suffered first and triumphed last.
