Olvasmány szent Pál apostol Korintusiakhoz irott elsõ levelébõl
!1 Cor 7:25-31
25 A szüzeket illetõen nincs külön parancsom az Úrtól, tanácsot azonban adok,~
mint olyan, aki az Úr irgalma folytán hitelt érdemel.
26 Azt tartom, a mostani megpróbáltatások miatt ez az állapot ajánlható; jó, ha~
így marad az ember.
27 Ha asszonyhoz vagy kötve, ne törekedj elválni, ha azonban nem kötötted magad~
asszonyhoz, ne keress feleséget.
28 De ha megnõsülsz, nem vétkezel, s ha a lány férjhez megy, nem követ el bûnt.~
Ám az ilyeneket testi nyugtalanság gyötri, s én meg akarlak kímélni benneteket.
29 Azt mondom tehát, testvérek: Az idõ rövid, azért akinek van felesége, éljen~
úgy, mintha nem volna,
30 aki sír, mintha nem sírna, aki örül, mintha nem örülne, aki vásárol, mintha~
meg sem tartaná,
31 s aki felhasználja a világ dolgait, mintha nem élne velük, mert ez a világ~
elmúlik.

[Responsory1]
R. The musicians played, and the maiden Cecily sang in her heart unto the Lord~
alone, saying
* Lord, let my heart and my body be undefiled, that I be not ashamed.
V. She fasted and prayed for two days and three days together, committing the~
cause of her fear unto the Lord.
R. Lord, let my heart and my body be undefiled, that I be not ashamed.

!1 Cor 7:32-35
32 Azt szeretném, ha mentek volnátok a gondtól. A nõtlennek arra van gondja, ami~
az Úré: hogyan járjon az Úr kedvében.
33 A nõs azonban világi dolgokkal törõdik: hogyan keresse felesége kedvét,
34 ezért meg van osztva. A nem házas asszony és a szûz arra gondol, ami az Úré,~
hogy testben és lélekben szent legyen, míg a férjes nõt világi dolgok kötik le:~
hogyan járjon férje kedvében.
35 Ezt javatokra mondom, nem azért, hogy tõrbe csaljalak, hanem hogy a~
feddhetetlen életre és az Úrhoz való osztatlan ragaszkodásra segítselek titeket.

[Responsory2]
R. O Blessed Cecily, thou didst convert the two brethren, but thou didst~
overcome Almachius the judge
* Thou didst point out Urban the Bishop, by this, that his face was as the face~
of an Angel.
V. Busy like a bee, thou didst serve the Lord.
R. Thou didst point out Urban the Bishop, by this, that his face was as the face~
of an Angel.

!1 Cor 7:36-40
36 Ha valaki mégis úgy véli, hogy igazságtalanul bánna hajadon lányával, mert~
eljárt fölötte az idõ, ha úgy van rendjén, tegye, amit akar. Nem vétkezik,~
kössenek csak házasságot.
37 Akinek azonban szilárd a meggyõzõdése, s minden kényszerítõ ok nélkül,~
teljesen szabadon úgy döntött, hogy megõrzi hajadon lányát, jól teszi.
38 Tehát aki férjhez adja hajadon lányát, jól teszi, aki pedig nem adja férjhez,~
még jobban teszi.
39 Az asszony le van kötve, amíg férje él, de ha férje meghal, felszabadul.~
Férjhez mehet, akihez akar, de csak az Úrban.
40 Boldogabb azonban, ha úgy marad, ahogy van. Ez a tanácsom, és hiszem, hogy~
Isten Lelke szerint beszélek.

R. Talking with God and praying.

Cecily was a Roman maiden of noble birth, trained up from her earliest years in~
the teaching of the Christian faith, and who by vow consecrated her virginity to~
God. She was afterwards given in marriage, against her will, to Valerian. On the~
first night she said to him Valerian! I am under the wardship of an Angel, who~
keepeth me always a maiden. Therefore do nothing unto me, lest the anger of God~
should be aroused against thee. Valerian was moved at her words, and dared not~
to touch her. Also he added even this, that he would believe in Christ, if he~
could see the Angel. Cecily answered him that that could not be unless he were~
first baptized, and for the sake of seeing the Angel he was willing. So she bade~
him go unto Pope Urban, who was hiding in the sepulchre of the Martyrs on the~
Appian Way on account of the persecution. And he went unto him and was baptized.

[Responsory4]
R. Cecily brought her body under with haircloth, and besought God with loud~
crying
* And called Tiburtius and Valerian to crowns.
V. This is one of the wise virgins, one chosen out of the number of the prudent.
R. And called Tiburtius and Valerian to crowns.

[Lectio5]
Whence he came back to Cecily, and found her praying, and the Angel with her,~
shining from the glory of God. As soon as he had recovered from the shock of~
wonder and fear, he brought his brother Tiburtius, and Cecily taught him Christ,~
and he was baptized by the same Pope Urban, and he also was vouchsafed to see~
the Angel whom his brother had seen. A little while after, both of them bravely~
suffered martyrdom under the Praefect Almachius, who then caused Cecily to be~
taken, and asked of her, first of all, where was the property of Tiburtius and~
Valerian?

[Responsory5]
R. He found Cecily praying in her chamber, and standing by her the Angel of the~
Lord.
* And when Valerian saw him, he feared with a great fear.
V. The Angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and a light shone in all the~
house.
R. And when Valerian saw him, he feared with a great fear.

[Lectio6]
To him the Virgin answered that all their goods had been given to the poor.~
Thereupon he was filled with fury, and commanded her to be taken home, and burnt~
in the bath. She was in that place a day and a night, but the fire had not~
harmed her. Then was sent the executioner, who gave her three strokes of the axe,~
and, as he could not cut off her head, left her half-dead. Three days thereafter,~
upon the 22nd day of November, in the reign of the Emperor Alexander Severus,~
she winged her flight for heaven, glorified with the two palms of virginity and~
martyrdom. Her body was buried in the cemetery of Kallistus by the aforenamed~
Pope Urban, who also consecrated a Church in her name in her own house. Her~
reliques were brought into the city by Pope Paschal I., along with those of~
Tiburtius, Valerian, and Maximus, and all laid together in the said Church of St~
Cecily.

[Responsory6]
R. O Lord Jesus Christ, the Good Shepherd, Who hast said of abstaining from~
marriage, He that is able to receive it, let him receive it, accept now the~
fruits from this seed, which Thou didst sow in the heart of Cecily.
* Busy like a bee, thine handmaiden Cecily served thee.
V. For her husband, who was like a raging lion when she took him, she sent unto~
thee meek as the meekest of lambs.
R. Busy like a bee, thine handmaiden Cecily served thee.
&Gloria
R. Busy like a bee, thine handmaiden Cecily served thee.

[Lectio94]
Cecilia a Roman virgin of noble birth vowed her virginity to God at a very early~
age. Unwillingly given in marriage to Valerian, she persuaded him to leave her~
untouched and go to blessed Urban. the Pope, that when he had been baptized he~
might be worthy to see Cecilia's angelic protector. When Valerian had obtained~
this favor, he converted his brother Tiburtius to Christ, and a little later~
both were martyred under the prefect Almachius. But Cecilia was seized by the~
same prefect because she had distributed the two brothers' wealth to the poor,~
and orders were given to have her suffocated in a bath. When the heat dared not~
harm her. she was struck three times with an axe and left half dead. After three~
days she received the palm of virginity and of martyrdom, and was buried in the~
cemetery of Callistus. Her body and those of Popes Urban and Lucius, and of~
Tiburtins, Valerian and Maximus were transferred by Pope Paschal I to a church~
in the City dedicated to St. Cecilia.

Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kõnyvébõl
!Matt 25:1-13
Abban az idõben így szólt Jézus tanítványaihoz: A mennyek országa hasonlít a~
tíz szûzhöz, akik fogták lámpásukat, és a võlegény elé mentek. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St John Chrysostom, Patriarch (of Constantinople.)
!Hom 79 on Matth.
Wherefore doth the Lord set forth this parable under the figure of virgins, and~
not make it of acceptation for all men? He had spoken great things touching~
virginity, saying There be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the~
kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.~
~(Matth. xix. 12.) He knew also that virginity is a thing which is held in great~
honour among men, being indeed a thing higher than nature, as is plain from this,~
that under the Old Testament even the Patriarchs and Saints did not practise it,~
and that under the New Testament it is not enjoined by any commandment of~
necessity; for the Lord did not make it binding, but left it open to the free~
choice of the faithful. Whence also Paul saith Concerning virgins I have no~
commandment of the Lord; yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy~
of the Lord to be faithful. I suppose therefore that this is good for the~
present distress, that it is good for a man so to be. But and if thou marry,~
thou hast not sinned, and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. (1 Cor. vii.~
25, 26, 28.)

[Responsory7]
R. Blessed Cecily said unto Tiburtius: To-day I call thee my brother, for the~
love of God hath made thee
* To cast away idols.
V. For even as the love of God hath made thy brother to be my husband, so the~
same hath made thee to be my brother, (and)
R. To cast away idols.

[Lectio8]
Virginity then, being a thing in itself so great and so much esteemed among many,~
lest any man having attained unto it, and kept it undefiled, should think that~
he hath done all, and so leave the rest undone, the Lord putteth forth this~
parable, in order to show that if virginity, though it have all else, lack mercy,~
its owner will but have his portion without among the fornicators, among whom~
Christ doth justly place the heartless and pitiless celibate. The fornicator is~
entangled in lust after bodies, the other in lust after money. The lust for~
bodies and the lust for money are two very different things, whereof the fleshly~
is by far the keener and the stubborner appetite. They that strive with the~
weaker enemy are therefore much less excusable if they fall. Wherefore the Lord~
hath called such virgins foolish, for having first won the stern battle, and~
then been destroyed in the light one.

[Responsory8]
R. Cecily hath sent me unto you, that ye may show me the holy Bishop
* For unto him I have a secret message to deliver.
V. Then Valerian went his way, and found the holy Urban by the sign which had~
been given him.
R. For unto him I have a secret message to deliver.
&Gloria
R. For unto him I have a secret message to deliver.

[Lectio9]
Why the lamps spoken of in this parable, the Lord signifieth the actual gift of~
virginity and holy continency, and by the oil gentleness, almsgiving, and~
helpfulness toward the needy. While the Bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered~
and slept. His disciples hoped that His kingdom was to come forthwith. To call~
them away from this hope, to lead them away from this thought, He showeth them~
the time of waiting for the Bridegroom to be no very short one. They all~
slumbered and slept. He calleth death a sleep. And at midnight there was a cry~
made, Behold, the Bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet Him. This at midnight is~
either a continuation of the parable (and so signifieth the awaking of the dead,)~
or else meaneth that the again-rising to come will actually take place in the~
night. Of the cry Paul also maketh mention, where he saith The Lord Himself~
shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the Archangel, and~
with the trump of God. (1 Thess. iv. 16.)
