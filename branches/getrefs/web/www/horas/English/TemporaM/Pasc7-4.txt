[Lectio1]
From the Holy Gospel according to Luke 
!Luke 9:1-6 
At that time: Jesus called His;~
twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority ovei all devils,~
and to cure diseases. And so on.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop of Milan.
!Bk. vi. on Luke ix.
We learn from the commandments of the Gospel what manner of men they ought to be~
who preach the glad tidings of the kingdom of God "Take nothing for your journey~
neither staves nor scrip, neither bread neither money." Thus let the Apostle~
destitute of earthly help, and panoplies in faith, deem himself able to do all~
the more, as he needeth all the less Such as please may also put upon these~
words a spiritual interpretation in that a man may be said to lay as the~
encumbrances of the body, not only by abdicating power, and casting away riches,~
but also by denying the very body itself its pleasures. The first general~
commandment given to the Apostles touching their manners was to be bringers of~
peace, (Matth. x. 13,) and to be no gadders about, but keepers of the laws of~
guests. To wander from house to house, and to abuse the rights of hospitality,~
are things alien to a preacher of the kingdom of heaven.

[Responsory1]
R. The fire of God fell, not to burn them, but to enlighten them not to devour~
them, but to illuminate them and found the hearts of the disciples clean~
vessels.
* And He gave them gifts of His grace. Alleluia, Alleluia.
V. He found them one in love, and the out-poured grace of the Godhead shone~
through them.
R. And He gave them gifts of His grace. Alleluia, Alleluia.

[Lectio2]
But as the kindness of hospitality is to be met with courtesy, so also is it~
said " Whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off~
the very dust from your feet, for a testimony against them." Hereby is it taught~
that hospitality doth meet with a good reward, since not only do we bring peace~
to such as receive us, but also, if they be shadowed by some earthly vanities,~
these defects are taken away, where enter the feet of them that bear the glad~
tidings of Apostolic preachment. It is well written in Matthew (x. 11) "Into~
whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, inquire who in it is worthy and there~
abide till ye go thence" thus avoiding any possible need of going from house~
to house. But no such selection is commanded to him that giveth hospitality,~
lest his hospitality itself should be lessened, while he picketh his guests.

[Responsory2]
R. The Holy Ghost filled all the house where the Apostles were and there~
appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.
* And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak in divers~
tongues as the Holy Spirit gave them utterance. Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
V. When the disciples were all with one accord in one place, for fear of the~
Jews, suddenly there came a sound from heaven upon them.
R. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak in divers~
tongues as the Holy Spirit gave them utterance. Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
&Gloria
R. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak in divers~
tongues, as the Holy Spirit gave them utterance. Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.

[Lectio3]
This passage, taken according to the plain meaning, is a sacred commandment~
touching the religious duty of hospitality, but its heavenly words likewise hint~
at a mystery. When the house is chosen, it is asked if the master thereof be~
worthy. Let us see if this be not perchance a figure of the Church, and her~
Master, Christ. What worthier house can the Apostolic preacher enter, than the~
Holy Church? Or what host is more to be preferred before all others, than Christ,~
Whose use it is to wash the feet of His guests yea, Who suffereth not that any~
whom He receiveth into His house should dwell there with foul feet, but, defiled~
as they are by their former wanderings, doth vouchsafe to change them into new~
and clean livers. He Alone is He, from Whose house no man ought ever to go forth,~
nor change His roof for any other shelter, for unto Him it is well said " Lord,~
to whom shall we go Thou hast the words of eternal life, and we believe."~
(John vi. 68, 69.)
