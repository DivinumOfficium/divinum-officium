3:1 (The psalm of David when he fled from the face of his son Absalom.)
3:2 Many say to my soul: There is no salvation for him in his God.
3:4 But thou, O Lord, art my protector, my glory, and the lifter up of my head.
3:5 I have cried to the Lord with my voice: and he hath heard me from his holy hill.
3:6 I have slept and have taken my rest: and I have risen up, because the Lord hath protected me.
3:7 I will not fear thousands of the people surrounding me: arise, O Lord; save me, O my God.
3:8 For thou hast struck all them who are my adversaries without cause: thou hast broken the teeth of sinners.
3:9 Salvation is of the Lord: and thy blessing is upon thy people.
