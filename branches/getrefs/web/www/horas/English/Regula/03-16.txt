03-16# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 37: Concerning the Old and Infants
_
Although human nature of itself be drawn to feel pity towards these two times of life, namely that of the aged and that of infants, yet let the authority of the rule also provide for them. Let their weakness always have consideration and on no account let the strictness of the rule in respect to food be held to as regards them, but let there be gentle consideration exercised in their case and let them anticipate the regular hours for meals.
