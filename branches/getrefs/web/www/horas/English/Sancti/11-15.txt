[Oratio]
O God, who didst make blessed Albert, thy bishop and doctor, great in subjecting~
human wisdom to divine faith; grant we pray, that we may so adhere to the~
footprints of his authorative teaching that in heaven we may enjoy perfect life.
$Per Dominum.

[Lectio4]
Albert, called the Great, because of his extraordinary learning, was born in Suabia, at Lauingen on the Danube, and very carefully educated from boyhood.  To further his higher studies he left his native country and went to Padua.  At the urging of blessed Jordan, Master General of the Order of Preachers, he asked admission into the family of the Dominicans, in spite of the futile protests of his uncle.  After his election to membership among the brethren, Albert was dedicated in all things to God, and was conspicuous for his piety, his strict observance of the rule, and especially for his tender and filial devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary.  Always before study he spent some time in prayer.  After his profession of apostolic religion, he so regulated his schedule of life that he became an accomplished preacher of the word of God and an efficient instrument for the salvation of souls.  Soon the Order sent Albert to complete his studies at Cologne, where he made such progress in every branch of secular science that he surpassed all his contemporaries in scholarship and achievement.  In the meantime, as Alexander IV testifieth, he drank so deeply of the health-giving waters of doctrine, sprung forth from the fountain of the divine law, that his soul was flooded with their abundance.

[Lectio5]
That others might share the rich treasure of his learning, Albert was appointed professor at Hildesheim, then Freiburg, Ratisbon and Strasbourg successively.  He became the marvel of all.  During the period when he taught sacred theology in the famous University of Paris, he became world-famous, and received the degree of Master of Theology.  Examining the teachings of pagan philosophers in the light of sound reason, he demonstrated clearly that they were in fundamental accord with the tenets of the faith.  He expounded most brilliantly the thesis on the extent of the power of human understanding to comprehend divine mysteries.  How great was his genius, how brilliant his intellect, how zealously he applied himself to study until he had become learned in every branch of scholarship, especially sacred theology, is best shewn by his numerous writings.  These encompass every known subject.  Albert returned to Cologne to become president of the university conducted by his Order.  He was so successful that he became ever more widely acknowledged as an authority by the schools ; his reputation for learning increased.  Among his pupils was his beloved Thomas Aquinas.  Albert was first to recognize and acclaim the greatness of that intellect.  He had a deep devotion towards the Blessed Sacrament of the Altar and composed some magnificent works upon it.  He also pointed out wider fields for the study of the mystical things of the soul.  He succeeded so well that the zeal of this great master spread far and wide in the Church.

Amid so many very important duties Albert shone as an exemplar of the religious life.  His brethren, therefore, selected him to be prior of the German province.  He was summoned to Anagni, in the presence of the Supreme Pontiff, Alexander IV to refute that William who had been impiously and arrogantly attacking the mendicant orders.  Soon after this the Pope appointed Albert Bishop of Ratisbon.  As Bishop, Albert devoted himself almost entirely to the care of his flock.  Yet he retained meticulously his humility and love of poverty.  Up to the time he resigned his see, Albert was prompt and energetic in fulfilling the duties of his episcopal office.  He ministered to the spiritual needs of souls throughout Germany and the neighbouring provinces.  He was careful that the advice he gave to those who sought his counsels was wise and salutary.  So prudent was he in settling disputes that at Cologne he was called the peacemaker.  From far distant places, prelates and princes invited him to act as an arbiter to resolve differences.  Saint Louis, King of France, presented him with some relicks of the sacred Passion of Christ, and Albert cherished them devoutly all his days.  In the second Council of Lyons he was instruméntal in bringing to a successful conclusion several weighty matters.  He taught until he was worn out with age.  His last days were spent in holy contemplation.  In the year 1280 he entered into the joy of his Lord.  By the authority of the Roman Pontiffs, the honours of the altar had long since been conferred upon Albert in many dioceses and in the Order of Preachers, when Pius XI, gladly accepting the recommendations of the Congregation of Sacred Rites, extended his Feast to the universal Church, and conferred upon the title of Doctor.  Pope Pius XII appointed him the heavenly patron with God of all those who study the natural sciences.

Albert, called the Great, because of his unusual learning, was was born at Lauingen on the Danube in Suabia and carefully educated from his boyhood. He left his country to study in Padua. While he was there he applied to entrance to the Dominicans. His uncle protested futilely against this step, but Blessed Jordan, master general of the Order of Preachers, encouraged it. When Albert had joined the friars, he was shining example of religious observance and devotion. He loved the Blessed Virgin Mary above all and burned with zeal for souls. To complete his studies he was sent to Cologne. Then he was made to professor at Hildesheim, at Freiburg and Ratisbone and at Strasburg. In the master's chair at Paris, he earned a high reputation. He had Thomas Aquinas for his beloved disciple and was the first to perceive and predict the loftiness of his intellect. At Anagni, in the presence of the Pope Alexander IV, he refuted William, who had wickedly attacked the mendicant orders. Later he was made bishop of Ratisbone, where, in giving counsel and in settling disputes, he worked such wonders, as to deserve the title of peacemaker. He wrote many things about almost all branches of learning, especially the sacred sciences, and composed some famous works about the wonderful Sacrament of the altar. Famous for his virtues and for his miracles, he died in the Lord in the year 1280. By the authority of the pope a cult had long since been granted him in many dioceses and in the Order of Preachers, when Pius XI, willingly acceding to the desire of the Sacred Congregation of Rites, gave him also the title of Doctor and extended his feast to the Universal Church. Pius XII appointed him the heavenly patron with God of all those who study the natural sciences.

From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 5:13-19
In that time: Jesus said to his diciples: You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt lose its savour, wherewith shall it be salted? And so on.
_
Homily of St. Augustine, Bishop
!Lib. 1 de Sermone Domini in monte, cap. 6
The Lord would have us understand how that men do lose their power of savouring others with righteousness when they are willing to place their eternal welfare in jeopardy for the sake of any temporal advantage, like as attainment of ease or luxury, or escape from suffering or toil.  For that which is eternal, unlike things of this world, can neither be bestowed by men, nor by them taken away.  Hence, when he asketh : If the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? he would have us understand the question to be : If ye, by whom mankind is preserved from corruption, be willing to lose the kingdom of heaven so as to escape trials or persecutions in this world, who is there to preserve you from corruption, seeing ye are they that God hath chosen  to preserve all others from corruption?

[Lectio8]
Those that should be the salt of the earth, but have lost their savour, are thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.  But no one that suffereth persecution is truly said to be trodden under foot of men.  Rather, that one is truly trodden under foot of men  who through fear of persecution hath lost the savour of righteousness.  For no one can be trodden upon, unless he be beneath him which treadeth upon him.  And certainly no one who hath his heart in heaven, no matter how grievously he doth suffer in his body on earth, is rightly said to be beneath anyone who misuseth him.

[Lectio9]
Ye are the light of the world.  And we are to understand the word World in the same sense as the word Earth when he spoke above of the salt of the earth, that is, not that earth whereupon we walk with our bodily feet, but the men which dwell upon the earth ; in other words, sinners, for the sweetening and correction of whose corruption, the Lord hath sent his Apostles, as it were, as so much salt.  And so by the world we are to understand, not the heaven and the earth, but the men who are in the world and love the world, for the enlightening of whom the Apostles have been sent.  A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid : that is, what is founded upon the heights of righteousness, whereof the mountain upon which the Lord gave this discourse was itself a figure, is magnificent in the eyes of all men.
