Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus
!Sir 51:1-7
1 I will give glory to thee, O Lord, O King,~
and I will praise thee, O God my Saviour.
2 I will give glory to thy name: for thou hast been a helper and protector to~
me.
3 And hast preserved my body from destruction, from the snare of an unjust~
tongue, and from the lips of them that forge lies, and in the sight of them that~
stood by, thou hast been my helper.
4 And thou hast delivered me, according to the multitude of the mercy of thy~
name, from them that did roar, prepared to devour.
5 Out of the hands of them that sought my life, and from the gates of~
afflictions, which compassed me about:
6 From the oppression of the flame which surrounded me, and in the midst of the~
fire I was not burnt.
7 From the depth of the belly of hell, and from an unclean tongue, and from~
lying words, from an unjust king, and from a slanderous tongue:

[Responsory1]
R. The Levite Lawrence wrought a good work, in that with the sign of the Cross~

R. And dispersed among the needy the riches of the Church.

[Lectio2]
!Sir 51:8-13
8 My soul shall praise the Lord even to death.
9 And my life was drawing near to hell beneath.
10 They compassed me on every side, and there was no one that would help me. I~
looked for the succour of men, and there was none.
11 I remembered thy mercy, O Lord, and thy works, which are from the beginning~
of the world.
12 How thou deliverest them that wait for thee, O Lord, and savest them out of~
the hands of the nations.
13 Thou hast exalted my dwelling place upon the earth and I have prayed for~
death to pass away.

[Responsory2]
R. O my child, be not afraid, for I am with thee, saith the Lord.
* When thou passest through the fire, the flame shall not harm thee, neither~
shall the smell of fire pass upon thee.
V. And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee~
out of the hand of the terrible.

my prayer was heard.

The Lesson is taken From the Sermons of Pope St Leo (the Great.)
!For St Lawrence's Birth-day.
Then the fury of the heathen power was raging against Christ's choicest members,~
in aiming in especial at such as were of the Priestly Order, the wicked~
persecutor turned fiercely on the Levite Lawrence, who was remarkable, not only~
as a minister of the Sacraments, but also as distributor of the property of the~
Church, promising himself a double prey by the taking of this one man, namely,~
to make him betray the consecrated treasure, and apostatise from the true faith.~
The wretch was thus doubly fired by his greed for money and his hatred of the~
truth, his greed urging him to seize the gold, and his wickedness to rob a~
believer of Christ. He demanded of the upright keeper of the sacred treasury, to~
bring him the wealth of the Church, for which his rapacity longed. But the~
pureminded Levite showed him where these riches were stored, by bringing before~
him a great multitude of holy poor, by the feeding and clothing of whom he had~
laid up all. that he had, in such wise, that it could be lost no more, and was~
now all the safer, as the way of spending it had been the holier.

[Responsory4]
R. Father, whither goest thou without thy son Holy Priest, dost thou fare~
hence without a Deacon
* It hath never been thy use to offer sacrifice without a minister.
V. What therefore in me hath displeased thee, my Father Hast thou tried me and~
found me unworthy to be called thy son Make trial if I am indeed an useless~
servant, even I, whom thou didst choose, to commit unto me the administration of~
the Cup of the Blood of the Lord.
R. It hath never been thy use to offer sacrifice without a minister.

[Lectio5]
The baffled thief chafed, and his hatred for the godliness which had appointed~
such an use of riches, flaming forth, he attempted the robbery of a dearer~
treasure from him in whose hands he had found no coin, even to take from him~
that possession wherein he had holier wealth. He commanded Lawrence to deny~
Christ, and made ready to assail the immovable firmness of the Levite's soul~
with appalling tortures, of which the failure of the first was followed by the~
application of others more fearful still. When his limbs had been mangled and~
cut by many stripes, his tormentor ordered them to be roasted over a fire. He~
was laid on an iron grating, the bars of which by the continual fire below,~
became themselves burning hot, so that by turning and rearranging his limbs upon~
them, his agony was kept keener, and his suffering made to last longer.

[Responsory5]
R. Leave me not, holy Father, for I have spent already thy treasures.
* I leave thee not, my son, neither forsake thee but there awaiteth thee for~
Christ's truth a wrestling sterner than mine.
V. We, as old men, have an easier race to run for thee in thy youth there is~
kept a more glorious victory over the enemy yet three days, and thou shalt~
follow me, the Deacon behind the Priest.
R. I leave thee not, my son, neither forsake thee but there awaiteth thee for~
Christ's truth a wrestling sterner than mine.

[Lectio6]
Cruel savage! thou gainest nothing, and advancest nothing. That which can die~
passeth by degrees beyond the reach of thy tortures, and when Lawrence departeth~
to heaven, thou and thy fires are conquered. The love of Christ could not be~
overcome by the flames, and the glow that scorched the outward man was colder~
than that that burnt in the inner. Thou didst rage, O thou persecutor thou~
didst rage against the Martyr, but by making keener his agony, thou hast but~
made nobler his palm. What did thine imagination fail to discover that could~
minister to the glory of him who conquered thee, since even the means of his~
execution have turned to the honour of his triumph Wherefore, dearly beloved~
brethren, let us rejoice with spiritual joy, and make our boast in the Lord, Who~
is wonderful in His Saints, (Ps. lxvii. 36,) and hath given unto us, in them an~
help and an ensample let us, I say, make our boast of the extraordinary~
happiness of the illustrious Lawrence's end, in that same Lord Who hath so~
glorified the name of His servant throughout the whole world, that from the~
rising of the sun unto the going down thereof, wheresoever the constellation of~
the Levitical lights shineth, even as Jerusalem is made glorious by Stephen, so~
Rome is made famous by Lawrence.

[Responsory6]
R. The blessed Lawrence cried and said My God do I worship, and Him only do I~
serve
* And therefore I am not afraid of thy tortures.
V. The darkness is no darkness to me, but the night is all as clear as the~
morning, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.
R. And therefore I am not afraid of thy tortures.
&Gloria
R. And therefore I am not afraid of thy tortures.

[Lectio7]
From the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 12:24-26At that time Jesus said unto His disciples Amen, Amen, I say unto you,~
Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone. And so~
on.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!Tract $ on John.
The Lord Jesus was Himself a corn of wheat that was to die and bring forth much~
fruit to die by the unbelief of the Jews, and to bring forth much fruit in the~
faith of the Gentiles. He, exhorting men to follow His steps, saith He that~
loveth his life shall lose it. Now, these words may be understood in two ways.~
First he that loveth his life shall lose it, that is, If thou love life, thou~
wilt lose it if thou wilt live for ever in Christ, refuse not to die for~
Christ. Or secondly he that loveth his life shall lose it love not then that~
which thou shalt lose love not this present life, so that thou be thereby in~
jeopardy of losing life eternal.

[Responsory7]
R. Upon the bars I denied thee not, O God.
* And when they put me to the fire, I acknowledged thee to be the Lord, O Jesus~
Christ.
V. Lord, Thou hast proved mine heart and visited it by night.
R. And when they put me to the fire, I acknowledged thee to be the Lord, O Jesus~
Christ.

[Lectio8]
What this second interpretation is the meaning of the Gospel, appeareth most~
probable from the words which follow: And he that hateth his life in this world,~
shall keep it unto life eternal. From which we may suppose the sense of the~
first words to be He that loveth his life in this world shall lose it unto~
life eternal. This is a great and marvellous saying, showing how a man may so~
love life as to lose life, and so hate life as to keep life. If thou love it too~
well, then dost thou hate it if thou hate it with an holy hatred, then dost~
thou love it. Blessed are they that, lest they should so love it as to lose it,~
so hate it as to keep it.

[Responsory8]
R. O Hippolytus, if thou believest in the Lord Jesus Christ,
* I lay before thee treasure an hundredfold, and promise thee life everlasting. 
V. The blessed Lawrence said unto Hippolytus If thou believest in the Lord~
Jesus Christ
R. I lay before thee treasure an hundred-fold, and promise thee life~
everlasting.
&Gloria
R. I lay before thee treasure an hundred-fold, and promise thee life~
everlasting.

[Lectio9]
Beware lest thou take these words He that hateth his life in this world shall~
keep it unto life eternal as some do, for an approval of suicide. Some evil and~
perverse men, bloody and guilty murderers of themselves, do indeed throw~
themselves into the fire, drown themselves in water, and cast themselves down~
precipices, and so perish. This is not the teaching of Christ, Who, when the~
devil would have Him cast Himself down from an high place, answered Get thee~
behind Me, Satan. It is written, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. (Matth.~
iv. 5-7.) Who also said to Peter, signifying by what death he should glorify God~
When thou wast young thou girdedst thyself and walkedst whither thou wouldest~
but when thou shalt be old, another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou~
wouldest not. (John xxi. 18.) From which it is evident that he that would follow~
Christ's footsteps, must be slain, not by himself, but by another.
