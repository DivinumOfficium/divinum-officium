[Oratio]
Grant, we beseech thee, O Almighty God, that the worshipful Feast of thy blessed~
Confessor and Bishop Gregory, may avail us to the in crease both of godliness~
toward thee, and healthfulness to our own souls.

[Lectio4]
Gregory, Archbishop of NeoCaesarea, in Pontus, is famous indeed for his holiness~
and doctrine, but much more so on account of the signs and wonders which he~
wrought, the number and character of which were so extraordinary that they have~
gotten him the name of Thaumatourgos, (which is, being interpreted from the~
Greek, the Wonderworker.) Holy Basil compareth him with Moses, with the~
Prophets, and with the Apostles, and testifieth that by his prayers he moved a~
mountain that stood in the way of the building of a Church. Moreover, he dried~
up a marsh, which was a cause of strife between brothers. Also, when the River~
Lycus overflowed and wasted the fields, he set his walking-stick on the bank,~
(which stick forthwith grew into a green tree,) and confined the stream within~
its bed, so that it never more passed that place again.

[Lectio5]
He oftentimes cast out devils either from heathen idols or from the bodies of~
men, and did many other marvellous things, whereby he drew countless numbers to~
believe in Jesus Christ. Also he had the spirit of prophecy, and foretold things~
to come. When he was at the point of death, he asked how many unbelievers were~
left in the city of Neo-Caesarea? and when they answered Seventeen, he gave God~
thanks, and said: Just so many were the faithful when I took the Bishoprick. He~
wrote a great deal, whereby, as well as by his wonders, he hath enlightened the~
Church of God.

From the Sermons of St Maximus, Bishop (of Turin.)
!59 Homily, being the 2nd on St Eusebius of Vercelli.
Our blessed Father Gregory is safe now, and we may safely praise his great~
deeds. He that kept such a manful hand upon the tiller of faith, hath now cast~
the anchor of hope in moorings of great calm, and brought his ship, heavy laden~
with heavenly riches and everlasting merchandise, safe into the heaven where he~
would be. Thus fareth it now with him who never fainted, but for so long time~
held up ever the shield of the fear of God against all that did beset him. What~
was his whole life but one long fight against an enemy that never slept?

[Lectio94]
Gregory, bishop of Neocesarea in Pontus, was famous for his holiness and learning, but still most famous for his signs and miracles. These were so numerous and outstanding that he was called Thaumaturgus, the Wonderworker. St. Basil compares him to Moses, the Prophets and the Apostles. By his prayer he changed the location of a mountain which was obstructing the building of a church. He dried up a swamp which was a cause of discord between two brothers. When the river Lycus was destructively flooding the fields, he drove his staff into the bank, where it grew into a green tree; and he compelled the river never afterwards to go beyond that spot. He very frequently cast out demons from the images of idols and from the bodies of men, and did many other wonderful things by which innumerable men were drawn to the faith of Jesus Christ. He also had the prophetic spirit of predicting future events. When he was about to depart this life, he asked how many unbelievers still remained in the city of Neocaesarea..When he was told that there were only seventeen, he thanked God and said, "There was just that number of believers when I became bishop." His many writings, as well as his miracles, enlightened the Church of God.

From the Holy Gospel according to Mark
!Mark 11:22-24
And Jesus answering, saith to them: Have the faith of God. Amen I say to you,~
that whosoever shall say to this mountain, Be thou removed and be cast into the~
sea, and shall not stagger in his heart, but believe, that whatsoever he saith~
shall be done; it shall be done unto him. And so on.
_
Homily by the Venerable Bede, Priest (at Jarrow.)
!Bk. iii. Comment, on Mark, xi.
The heathen, who have written blasphemies against the Church, are used to cast~
in our teeth that we have not full faith in God, since we have never been able~
to move mountains. Such should be answered that we do not possess records of~
everything that hath come to pass in the Church, any more than, the Scripture~
being witness, we possess records of all the doings of our Lord Christ Himself.~
(John xx. 30; xxi. 25.) Mountains may have been removed and cast into the sea,~
in case of need; a like case, indeed, as we read, was that which came to pass at~
the prayers of the Blessed Father Gregory, Archbishop of Neo-Caesarea, in Pontus,~
that right worthy and mighty man, when a mountain was moved from one place on~
land to another place on land, as the dwellers in the city had need.

[Lectio8]
Gregory was wishful to build a Church in a meet place, but the site was too~
narrow, being wedged in between a mountain on the one side and a precipice going~
down into the sea on the other. He came therefore by night to the place,~
kneeling down, and reminding the Lord of His promise, and calling upon Him to~
remove the mountain. And in the morning, when he came thither again, he found~
that the mountain had been removed back, and as much room left for the builders~
of the Church as they needed. This man therefore would have been able, and any~
other man of like grace would have been able, if need were, to obtain of the~
Lord, by the force of his faith, that even a mountain should be removed, and be~
cast into the sea.

[Lectio9]
Mystycally however by a mountain is sometimes signified the devil, on account of~
the pride whereby he lifteth himself up against God, and would fain be like unto~
the Most High. And when holy teachers, strong in faith, do preach the Word, this~
mountain is removed, and cast into the sea, that is to say, the unclean spirit~
is removed out of the hearts of such as are foreordained unto eternal life, and~
sent free to exercise the wild rage of his tyranny in the riotous and embittered~
minds of the unfaithful.
