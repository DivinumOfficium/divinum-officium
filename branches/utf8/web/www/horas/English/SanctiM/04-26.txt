[Lectio4]
Cletus was a Roman, the son of Emilian, of the Fifth Region of the city, and the~
street called Noble. He ruled the Church in the time of the Emperors Vespasian~
and Titus. In accordance with the precept of the Prince of the Apostles He~
ordained twenty-five Priests for the city. He was the first Pope who made use in~
his letters of the phrase "Health and Apostolic Benediction." When he had ruled~
the Church for twelve years, seven months, and two days, and brought it into an~
excellent state of order, in the reign of the Emperor Domitian, and the second~
persecution since the time of Nero, he was crowned with martyrdom, and buried on~
the Vatican mount, hard by the body of blessed Peter.

[Lectio5]
Marcellinus was a Roman; he ruled the Church from the year 296 to the year 304,~
during the savage persecution which was ordered by the Emperor Diocletian. He~
suffered through the false severity of those who blamed him as being too~
indulgent toward them who had fallen into idolatry, and for this reason also~
hath been slandered to the effect that he himself burnt incense to idols but~
this blessed Pope, on account of his confession of the faith, was put to death~
along with three other Christians, whose names are Claudius, Cyrinus, and~
Antoninus. At the command of the Emperor their bodies were cast out unburied,~
and lay so for thirty- six days. At the end of that time St Peter appeared in a~
dream to Blessed Marcellus, and in obedience to his command the said Marcellus~
went with certain Priests and Deacons, singing hymns, and carrying lights, and~
buried these four bodies honourably in the Cemetery of Priscilla upon the~
Salarian Way. Marcellinus ruled the Church for seven years, eleven months, and~
twenty-three days. During this time he held two Advent ordinations, and ordained~
at them four Priests, and five Bishops for divers Sees.

[Lectio6]
From the Sermons of St Ambrose, Bishop of Milan
!xxii.
Dearly beloved brethren, it is very meet and right that after the gladness of~
Easter, which we have celebrated in the Church, we should mingle our own joy~
with the joy of the holy Martyrs yea, that we should tell of the glory of the~
Lord's rising again, to them that have been made partakers of the Lord's~
sufferings. It truly must needs be that they which have been partakers of His~
sufferings, should be also of His joy. For thus saith the blessed Apostle " As~
ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation." (2~
Cor. i. 7.) And again " If we suffer, we shall also reign with Him." (2 Tim. ii.~
12.) He, therefore, that endureth sorrow for Christ, must needs also have glory~
with Christ.
