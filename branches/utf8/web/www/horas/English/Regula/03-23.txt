03-23# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 43: Concerning Those Who Come Late to the Work of God Or to Table. Continued.
_
If anyone has not come to table before the versicle so that all may recite the versicle and say the prayer together, let him who through his own negligence and fault has not come in be corrected for this once and again: but if even then he has not amended let him not be permitted to share in the common table, but separated from the companionship of all let him have his meal alone and be deprived of his measure of wine until he has made satisfaction and amendment. And in like manner let him suffer who is not present at that versicle which is recited after a meal. And let not anyone presume to take food or drink before or after the appointed hour: but if the superior offers anything to anyone and he refuse to accept it, when the time comes that he desires this that he had previously refused or anything else, he shall on no account receive anything, until he has made suitable satisfaction.
