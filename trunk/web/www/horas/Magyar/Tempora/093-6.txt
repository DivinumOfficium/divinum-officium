Evangélium szent Lukács könyvéből
!Luke 13:6-17
Azon idoben Jézus példabeszédet mondott a tömegnek: Egy embernek a szőlejében~
volt egy fügefa. Kiment, gyümölcsöt keresett rajta, de nem talált. És így~
tovább.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great.)
!31st on the Gospels.
Our Lord and Redeemer speaketh unto us sometimes by words, and sometimes by~
deeds, sometimes one thing by words, and another by deeds, and sometimes the~
same thing both by word and deed. In the portion of the Gospel which hath this~
day been read, ye have heard, my brethren, two things, the parable of the~
fig-tree and the history of the woman which was bowed together. In both is a~
manifestation of the Lord's mercy, but in the one by a parable, in the other by~
an example. But the barren figtree signifieth the same thing as doth the woman~
bowed together, and the patience shown to the fig-tree the same thing as doth~
the healing of the woman bowed together.

What is the fig-tree a type, but of mankind Of what is the woman bowed~
together by a spirit of infirmity a type, but of the same mankind Man was~
originally placed in a garden like the fig-tree, and created upright like the~
woman, but man fell away by his own wilful fault like the fig-tree he brought~
forth no fruit like the woman he ceased to stand straight. When he wilfully~
went into sin, because he would not bring forth the fruit of obedience, he lost~
his uprightness. The nature which had been created in the image of God,~
continued not in honour, but cast aside the state wherein it had been placed and~
made. The lord of the vineyard came thrice to the fig-tree, for God hath come in~
hope, and in warning, seeking fruit from mankind under three successive~
dispensations, that is to say, before the law, under the law, and under grace.

It came before the law, in that by natural understanding, He let all know by~
example of Himself, what and how they should do toward their neighbour. In the~
law He came teaching. After the law He came by grace, opening, manifesting His~
merciful Presence. But after all these three years He yet hath to complain that~
He findeth no fruit upon the fig-tree, for there are still some degraded minds~
which the inborn voice of the natural law doth not control, which the~
commandments do not teach, and which the wonders of the Incarnation itself do~
not convert. Of what is the dresser of the vineyard a type, but of the~
Episcopacy? For these are they who have the government in the Church, and~
are therefore truly called the dressers of the Lord's vineyard.

Give light, O Lord, to them that sit in darkness, * and guide our feet into the~
way of peace, O Thou the God of Israel.

V. We are filled in the morning with thy mercy:
R. And we have rejoiced, and are delighted

[Oratio]
O God, Who hast chosen healthy fasting, as a mean to do good both to bodies and~
to souls, we humbly implore thy Majesty, that the godly prayer of such as be~
fasting this day may turn away thy wrath, and may be effectual to gain for us~
thy blessing in time and in eternity.
