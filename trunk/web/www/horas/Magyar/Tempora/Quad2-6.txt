Evangélium szent Lukács könyvébõl
!Luke 15:11-32
Azon idõben mondá Jézus a farizeusoknak és írástudóknak: Egy embernek volt két~
fia. A fiatalabbik egyszer így szólt apjához: Apám, add ki nekem az örökség rám~
esõ részét És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!Bk. vii. Comment, on Luke xv.
Thou seest how that the heavenly goods are given to such as seek them. Neither~
oughtest thou to think the father to blame, because he gave to his younger son.~
In the kingdom of God there is no age of weakness, neither doth faith wax infirm~
with years. He, surely, who asked, deemed himself of sufficient age. And would~
that he had not left his father! then had he been ignorant of the obstacle of~
his age! But after that he had left his father's house, and had gone into a far~
country, he began to be in want. Well is he said to have wasted his substance,~
who hath cut himself off from the Church!
