Evangélium szent Máté könyvéből
!Matt 21:10-17.
Azon időben amikor Jézus beért Jeruzsálembe, az egész város izgalomba jött.  És így tovább.
_
Homily by the Venerable Bede, Priest (at Jarrow.)
!11th for Lent, Tom. vii.
The same thing which the Lord showed in a figure by cursing the barren fig-tree,~
He afterwards more plainly put before us by casting the desecrators out of the~
temple. The tree herself had not sinned by bearing no fruit when the Lord was~
hungry, for the time of figs was not yet come, but those Priests had sinned who~
were carrying on worldly business in the Lord's house, and who neglected to~
bring forth that fruit of godliness which they owed, and which the Lord was~
hungry to find in them. The Lord made the fig-tree to wither away under His~
curse, that all men who saw it, and all men who hear of it, might know that they~
will be condemned by the judgment of God, if they content themselves with the~
talk of godliness, without the solid fruit of good works, even as that barren~
figtree was clothed only with a rustling garb of green leaves.

[Lectio2]
But because the buyers and sellers understood not the parable of the barren~
fig-tree, the Lord brought upon them the stroke of the punishment that they had~
deserved, and cast out the traffickers in earthly things, from that house,~
wherein it had been commanded that nothing should be done save the work of God,~
sacrifices and prayers offered up to Him, and His word read, taught, and sung.~
And yet it may be believed that nothing was being sold or bought in the temple~
save such things as were needful for the service thereof, as we read in another~
place, (John ii. 14,) that when Jesus went into the temple "He found those that~
sold oxen and sheep and doves, and all these things were doubtless there~
for no other end but to be offered to God in that His holy house, and were sold~
by the natives to those worshippers who came from a distance, to be so used.

[Lectio3]
If, therefore, the Lord would not have to be sold in the temple, even such~
things as He willed should be offered therein, (On account, that is, of the~
greed or dishonesty which is often the stain of such transactions,) with what~
anger, suppose ye, would He visit such as He might find laughing or gossiping~
there, or yielding to any other sin If the Lord suffer not to be carried on in~
His house such worldly business as may be freely done elsewhere, how much more~
shall such things as ought never to be done anywhere, draw down the anger of God~
if they be done in His own holy house Lastly the Holy Ghost came down upon~
the Lord in the shape of a dove, and by doves therefore may be signified the~
gifts of that Holy Spirit. They, then, to this day sell doves in the temple of~
God, who take money in the Church for the laying on of their hands, whereby the~
Holy Ghost is given from heaven.

[Ant 2]
Jesus went into * the temple of God, * and cast out all them that sold and~
bought and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them~
that sold doves.

[Oratio 2]
Look down, O Lord, on this thy family, and grant that our minds, which, by the~
chastening of the body, we seek to purify, may ever more and more shine in thy~
sight by strong hungering after thee.
$Per Dominum.

[Ant 3]
For it is written * that My house is the house of prayer * for all nations but~
ye have made it a den of thieves and He was daily teaching in the temple.

[Oratio 3]
O Lord, may our prayers come up before thy presence, and do Thou mercifully rid~
thy Church of all wickedness.
$Per Dominum.
