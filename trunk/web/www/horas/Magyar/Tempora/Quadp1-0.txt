v. Nem tudjátok, hogy a pályán küzdõk mind futnak ugyan, de a díjat csak egy~
nyeri el? Úgy fussatok, hogy elnyerjétek!
$Deo gratias

[Ant 1]
The Lord said unto Adam * Of the tree which is in the midst of the garden thou~
shalt not eat in the hour that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die.

[Versum 1]
V. Let the evening prayer ascend unto thee, O Lord.
R. And let there descend upon us thy mercy.

[Oratio]
O Lord, we beseech thee favourably to hear the prayers of thy people; that we,~
who are justly punished for our offences, may be mercifully delivered by thy~
goodness, for the glory of thy Name.
$Per Dominum.

[Invit]
Let us come before the presence of the Lord * and make a joyful noise unto Him with Psalms.

[Lectio1]
Here starts the first Book of Moses
!Gen 1:1-8
1 Kezdetkor teremtette Isten az eget és a földet.
2 A föld puszta volt és üres, sötétség borította a mélységeket, és Isten lelke~
lebegett a vizek fölött.
3 Isten szólt: "Legyen világosság", és világos lett.
4 Isten látta, hogy a világosság jó. Isten elválasztotta a világosságot a~
sötétségtõl.
5 A világosságot nappalnak nevezte Isten, a sötétséget pedig éjszakának. Azután~
este lett és reggel: az elsõ nap.
6 Isten újra szólt: "A vizek közepén keletkezzék szilárd boltozat, és alkosson~
válaszfalat a vizek között." Úgy is lett.
7 Isten megalkotta a szilárd boltozatot, és elválasztotta vele a boltozat~
fölötti és a boltozat alatti vizeket.
8 Isten a boltozatot égnek nevezte. Erre este lett és reggel: a második nap.

[Responsory1]
R. In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, wherein He made man~
also
* After His own image and likeness.
V. So God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his face the~
breath of life.
R. After His own image and likeness.

[Lectio2]
!Gen 1:9-19
9 Isten ismét szólt: "Gyûljenek össze az ég alatti vizek egy helyre és~
emelkedjék ki a száraz." Úgy is történt.
10 Isten a szárazat földnek nevezte, az összefolyt vizeket pedig elnevezte~
tengernek. Isten látta, hogy ez jó.
11 Akkor megint szólt Isten: "Teremjen a föld zöldellõ növényeket, amelyek~
termést hoznak, és fákat, amelyek magot rejtõ gyümölcsöt teremnek a földön." Úgy~
is lett.
12 A föld zöldellõ növényeket termett, amelyek termést hoznak fajuk szerint, és~
fákat, amelyek gyümölcsöt érlelnek, amelyben magvak vannak, a fajtának~
megfelelõen. Isten látta, hogy ez jó.
13 Este lett és reggel: a harmadik nap.
14 Akkor megint szólt Isten: "Legyenek világító testek az égbolton, s válasszák~
el a nappalt az éjszakától.
15 Ezek határozzák meg az ünnepeket, a napokat és az éveket. Fényeskedjenek az~
égbolton, s világítsák meg a földet." Úgy is lett.
16 Isten megteremtette a két nagy világítót. A nagyobbik világítót, hogy~
uralkodjék a nappalon és a kisebbik világítót, hogy uralkodjék az éjszakán, s~
hozzá még a csillagokat is.
17 Isten az égboltra helyezte õket, hogy világítsanak a földnek, uralkodjanak a~
nappal és az éjszaka fölött,
18 s válasszák el a világosságot meg a sötétséget.
19 Isten látta, hogy ez jó. Este lett és reggel: a negyedik nap.

[Responsory2]
R. In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, and the Spirit of God~
moved upon the face of the waters.
* And God saw everything that He had made, and it was very good.
V. Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the hosts of them.
R. And God saw everything that He had made, and it was very good.

[Lectio3]
!Gen 1:20-26
20 Isten szólt: "A vizek teljenek meg élõlények sokaságával, az égen, a föld~
felett pedig röpködjenek madarak". Úgy is történt.
21 Isten megteremtette fajtájuk szerint a nagy tengeri állatokat és mind az~
élõlényeket, amelyek mozognak, vagy a vízben úszkálnak. És a röpködõ madarakat~
is, ugyancsak fajtájuk szerint. Isten látta, hogy ez jó.
22 Isten megáldotta õket és így szólt: "Legyetek termékenyek, szaporodjatok,~
töltsétek be a tengerek vizét, s a madarak is szaporodjanak a földön."
23 Este lett és reggel: az ötödik nap.
24 Aztán szólt Isten: "Hozzon elõ a föld élõlényeket fajuk szerint:~
háziállatokat, csúszómászókat és mezei vadakat fajuk szerint." Úgy is történt.
25 Isten megteremtette a mezei vadakat fajuk szerint, a háziállatokat fajuk~
szerint és az összes csúszómászót a földkerekségen, fajonként. Isten látta, hogy~
ez jó.
26 Isten újra szólt: "Teremtsünk embert képmásunkra, magunkhoz hasonlóvá. Õk~
uralkodjanak a tenger halai, az ég madarai, a háziállatok, a mezei vadak és az~
összes csúszómászó fölött, amely a földön mozog."

[Responsory3]
R. The Lord formed man of the dust of the ground

also.

&Gloria
R. And breathed into his face the breath of life, and man became a living soul.

[Lectio4]
From the Handbook, written by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!Chaps, xxv. xxvi. xxvii. torn. 3.
The Lord threatened man with the punishment of death, in case he sinned. Thus~
did He gift him with free will, while He yet kept His lordship over him, and~
helped him with the dread of destruction. And so He put him in that happy garden,~
under the very shadow of the tree of life, in that good place from whence, had~
he kept his righteousness, he might have passed to a better. But the first man~
sinned, and was banished from Eden, and infected all his descendants with the~
disease of sin, poisoning their very root, and bringing upon all that sentence~
of death and damnation, which he had earned for himself. So that all that~
descend by fleshly generation from Adam, and from the guilty woman, who was the~
cause of his sin and the partaker of his punishment, derive from them original~
sin; whereby they are drawn through a way of divers sins and sorrows, towards~
that final ruin which they shall share with the rebel angels who are at once~
their corrupters, their lords, and their comrades.


[Responsory4]
R. God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden
* To dress it and to keep it.
V. And the Lord God had planted a garden aforetime in Eden, and there He put the~
man whom He had formed.
R. To dress it and to keep it.

[Lectio5]
So by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, (and so death passed~
upon all men,) in whom all have sinned. (Rom. v. 12.) By the world the Apostle~
signified! in this place all mankind. Thus then hath the matter stood. The~
damned mass of humanity lay in misery, or rather wallowed in it, and fell from~
bad to worse, till it joined the company of the sinning angels, and both~
together suffered the deserved punishment of their vile treason.

[Responsory5]
R. The Lord God said It is not good that the man should be alone.
* Let Us make an help meet for him.
V. But for Adam there was not found an help meet for him; and God said
R. Let Us make an help meet for him.

[Lectio6]
So the wrath of God appertained whatever sin man, through the blind and untamed~
sting of his flesh, willingly committeth, and whatever punishment, declared and~
open, he unwillingly suffereth. There is, indeed, no pause in that goodness of~
the Creator whereby He giveth even to the traitor angels life and strength,~
~(which if He gave not, they would be annihilated,) and whereby He formeth the~
seed of men, though they come of a corrupt and condemned stock, quickeneth them,~
strengtheneth and fitteth their limbs for the changing seasons of their life,~
extendeth their knowledge in divers places, and giveth them whereon to live. It~
hath been His will rather to draw good out of evil, than to suffer that there~
should be no evil.

[Responsory6]
R. The Lord caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and He took one of his ribs.
* And the rib which the Lord had taken from Adam made He a woman, and brought~
her unto Adam, to see what he would call her. And he called her name Woman,~
because she was taken out of Man.
V. And while he slept He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead~
thereof.
R. And the rib which the Lord had taken from Adam made He a woman, and brought~
her unto Adam, to see what he would call her.
&Gloria
R. And he called her name Woman, because she was taken out of Man.

Evangélium szent Máté könyvébõl
!Matt 20:1-16
Azon idõben ezt a peldabeszédet modta Jézus tanítványainak: "A mennyek országa~
hasonlít a gazdához, aki kora reggel kiment, hogy munkásokat fogadjon szõlejébe.~
És így tovább.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great.)
!19th on the Gospels.
We hear that the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder,~
which went out early in the morning, to hire labourers into his vineyard. Who~
indeed is more justly to be likened to an householder than our Maker, Who is the~
Head of the household of faith, bearing rule over them whom He hath made, and~
being Master of His chosen ones in the world, as a Master over those that are in~
his house? He it is That hath the Church for a vineyard, a vineyard that ceaseth~
not to bring forth branches of the True Vine, from righteous Abel to the last of~
the elect that shall be born in the world.

[Responsory7]
R. And the Lord God had planted a garden aforetime in Eden,
* And there He put the man whom He had formed.
V. And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant~
to the sight, and good for food, the tree of life also in the midst of the~
garden.
R. And there He put the man whom He had formed.

[Lectio8]
This householder, then, for the cultivation of his vineyard, goeth out early in~
the morning, and at the third hour, and the sixth hour, and the ninth hour, and~
the eleventh hour, to hire labourers into his vineyard. Thus the Lord, from the~
beginning to the end of the world, ceaseth not to gather together preachers for~
the instruction of His faithful people. The early morning of the world was from~
Adam until Noah; the third hour from Noah until Abraham; the sixth hour from~
Abraham until Moses; the ninth hour from Moses until the coming of the Lord; the~
eleventh hour from the coming of the Lord until the end of the world. At this~
eleventh hour are sent forth as preachers the Holy Apostles, who have received~
full wages, albeit they be come in late.

[Responsory8]
R. Behold, Adam is become as One of Us, to know good and evil.
* See lest he take of the tree of life and live for ever.
V. Unto Adam also did the Lord God make a coat of skins, and clothed him, and~
said
R. See lest he take of the tree of life and live for ever.

[Lectio9]
Nor the cultivation of His vineyard, (that is, the instruction of His people, )~
the Lord hath never ceased to send into it labourers. First, by the Fathers,~
then, by the Prophets and Teachers of the Law, and lastly, by the Apostles He~
hath dressed and tended the lives of His people, as the owner of a vineyard~
dresseth and tendeth it by means of workmen. Whoever in whatever degree joined~
to a right faith the teaching of righteousness, was so far one of God's~
labourers in God's vineyard. By the labourers at early morning, and at the third~
hour, the sixth hour, and the ninth hour, may be understood God's ancient people,~
the Hebrews, who strove to worship Him with a right faith in company with His~
chosen ones from the very beginning of the world, and thus continually laboured~
in His vineyard. And now, at the eleventh hour, it is said unto the Gentiles~
also Why stand ye here all the day idle?

[Responsory9]
R. The Lord said unto Cain Where is Abel thy brother? Lord, I know not am I~
my brother's keeper? And He said unto him What hast thou done?
* Behold, the voice of thy brother Abel's blood crieth unto Me from the ground.
V. Cursed shalt thou be upon the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive~
thy brother's blood from thy hand.
R. Behold, the voice of thy brother Abel's blood crieth unto Me from the ground.
&Gloria
R. Behold, the voice of thy brother Abel's blood crieth unto Me from the ground.

[Ant Laudes]
Have mercy upon me, * O God, and cleanse me from my sin for against thee only have I sinned.
I will praise thee, * for Thou hast heard me.
O God, Thou art my God, * early will I seek thee, because Thou hast been my help.
Blessed art Thou, * O our God, in the firmament of heaven, and worthy to be praised above all for ever.
Praise ye the Lord * from the heavens.

$Deo gratias

[Ant 2]
Thus saith the Lord The kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an~
householder, * which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his~
vineyard.

[Versum 2]
V. Lord, thou hast been our refuge
R. From generation to generation.

[Ant Prima]
And when he had agreed * with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them~
into his vineyard.

[Ant Tertia]

[Ant Sexta]
Why stand ye here * all the day idle? They answered and said unto him Because~
no man hath hired us.

[Capitulum Sexta]
!1 Cor 9:25
v. A versenyzõk valamennyien megtartóztató életet élnek, minden tekintetben. Õk~
hervadó koszorúért, mi pedig hervadhatatlanért.
$Deo gratias

[Ant Nona]
The Lord of the vineyard saith * Call the labourers, and give them their hire.

[Capitulum Nona]
!1 Cor 10:4-5
v. Ittak ugyanis a lelki sziklából, amely kísérte õket, s a szikla Krisztus~
volt. De legtöbbjükben nem telt kedve az Istennek.
$Deo gratias

[Ant 3]
The householder saith unto his labourers * Why stand ye here all the day idle?~
But they answered and said Because no man hath hired us. Go ye also into my~
vineyard, and whatsoever is right, that will I give you.

[Versum 3]
V. Let my prayer, O Lord, be set forth.
R. As incense before thee.
