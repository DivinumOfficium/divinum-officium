Olvasmány Sámuel első könyvéből
!1 Sam 6:1-3
1 Az Úr ládája hét hónapig volt a filiszteusok földjén. 
2 Akkor a filiszteusok hívatták a papokat és jövendőmondókat és megkérdezték: "Mit tegyünk az Úr ládájával. Adjátok tudtunkra, hogy mi módon juttassuk vissza a helyére." 
3 Ezek azt felelték: "Ha vissza akarjátok küldeni Izrael Istenének ládáját, akkor ne küldjétek üresen vissza, hanem fizessetek jóvátételt. Akkor meggyógyultok és megtudjátok, miért nem vette le rólatok a kezét."

!1 Sam 6:6-10
6 Miért keményítitek meg szíveteket, amint az egyiptomiak s a fáraó megkeményítették a szívüket? Nemde, amikor kegyetlenül bánt velük, akkor elengedték őket, úgyhogy elvonulhattak? 
7 Nos, csináltassatok egy új szekeret, és vegyetek két frissen ellett tehenet, amelyen még nem volt járom. Fogjátok be a teheneket a szekérbe, borjaikat meg vigyétek vissza az istállóba. 
8 Aztán fogjátok az Úr ládáját és tegyétek fel a szekérre. Az aranyholmit is rakjátok mellé, amit jóvátételül adtok, egy ládikában, s hagyjátok, menjenek. 
9 Aztán figyeljétek meg: ha odaérnek a hazafelé, a Bet-Semesbe vivő útra, akkor ő volt, aki ezt a nagy szerencsétlenséget ránk hozta; ha ellenben nem, akkor tudni fogjuk: nem az ő keze ért utol bennünket, hanem valami véletlen folytán lett osztályrészünk." 
10 Az emberek így tettek.

!1 Sam 6:12-15
12 A tehenek egyenesen a Bet-Semesbe vivő útra tértek, és azon az úton is maradtak, menet közben bőgtek, s nem tértek le se jobbra, se balra. A filiszteusok egész Bet-Semes határáig követték őket. 
13 Bet-Semes lakói épp a búzát aratták a síkságon. Amikor fölnéztek és megpillantották a ládát, boldogan elé siettek. 
14 Mihelyt a szekér a Bet-Semesbe való Józsue szántóföldjéhez ért, megállt. Volt ott egy nagy kő. Felaprították hát a szekér farészeit és bemutatták a teheneket az Úrnak égőáldozatul. 
15 A leviták leemelték az Úr.

[Lectio4]
From the Letter written to Caecilius by the Holy Martyr Cyprian, Bishop of~
Carthage.
!Bk. ii. Ep. 3.
In the deed of the Priest Melchisedek we see a type of the Sacrament of the~
Lord's Sacrifice. For thus it is written in the writings of God "And Melchisedek~
King of Salem brought forth bread and wine for he was the Priest of the Most~
High God and he blessed " Abraham. (Gen. xiv. 18.) That Melchisedek was a type~
of Christ, the Holy Ghost Himself doth testify in the Psalms, where the First~
Person of the Holy Trinity, even the Father, is set before us as saying unto the~
Second Person, that is, the Son "Before the daystar have I begotten thee.~
Thou art a Priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedek." (cix. 3, 4.) And~
verily that sameness of order cometh of this sacrifice, and procedeth from this,~
that Melchisedek was the Priest of the Most High God that he offered bread and~
wine and that he blessed Abraham.

[Lectio5]
What Priest of the Most High God is there, more so than is our Lord Jesus Christ~
He Who hath made an offering unto God the Father, and the same offering that~
Melchisedek made, bread and wine, that is to say, His Own Flesh and His Own~
Blood. And, as touching Abraham, that ancient blessing was spoken likewise by~
fore-knowledge upon us. For if Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him~
for righteousness, verily, whosoever believeth God and liveth by faith, the same~
is found righteous, and is shown unto us that he is already blessed in faithful~
Abraham, and justified as the Apostle Paul proveth, where he saith "Abraham~
believed God and it was accounted unto him for righteousness. Know ye therefore~
that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. And the~
Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached~
before the Gospel unto Abraham, saying In thee shall all nations be blessed."~
~(Gal. iii. 6-8.)

[Lectio6]
In Genesis, therefore, in order that the Priest Melchisedek might in due order~
pronounce the blessing upon Abraham, there was first offered a typical sacrifice,~
consisting of bread and wine. This was the offering which our Lord Jesus Christ~
completed and fulfilled, when He offered up bread and a cup of wine mingled with~
water. This fulfilment by Him Who came to fulfill (Matth. v. 17,) utterly~
satisfied the truth of the image which had gone before. The Holy Ghost doth by~
Solomon also clearly foreshadow, as it were in a parable, the Lord's Sacrifice,~
pointing to the victim slain, and the bread and the wine, and the Altar likewise,~
and the Apostles as it is written "Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath~
hewn out her seven pillars she hath killed her beasts, she hath mingled her~
wine, she hath also furnished her table. She hath sent forth her servants, she~
crieth upon the highest places of the city, saying Whoso is simple, let him~
turn in hither unto me. As for them that want understanding, she saith to them.~
Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled for you."~
~(Prov. ix. 1-5.)

!John 6:56-59
Aki eszi az én testemet és issza az én véremet, az bennem marad, én meg benne.~
Engem az élő Atya küldött, s általa élek. Így az is élni fog általam, aki engem~
eszik. És így tovább

Homily by St Austin, Bishop of Hippo.
!26/A Tract on John.
"Not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead." Wherefore did they eat and~
die Because they believed only that which they saw and that which they saw~
not, they understood not. Therefore were they your fathers, because ye are like~
unto them. Doth this death, my brethren, mean that death which is outward and~
bodily And do not we also die, who eat of that Bread Which cometh down from~
heaven That death died they, and so shall we also, as far, as I have said, as~
is meant that death which is outward and bodily.

[Lectio8]
But the death whereof the Lord doth sound the alarm, the death that their~
fathers died, is another death than that which is outward and bodily. Moses ate~
manna, Aaron ate manna, Phinehas ate manna, many ate manna in whom the Lord was~
well pleased and these are not dead. Wherefore Because they understood~
spiritually that outward bread, spiritually hungered thereafter, spiritually~
tasted thereof, and spiritually were satisfied therewith. So also do we this day~
feed on a visible food, but the Sacrament is one thing, and the grace of the~
Sacrament is another.

[Lectio9]
That eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself."~
~(1 Cor. xi. 29.) Is it not written " When Jesus had dipped the sop, he gave it~
to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, and after the sop Satan entered into him "~
~(John xiii. 26, 27.) And yet he took it. And when he had eaten it, the enemy~
entered in and possessed him. Not because what he ate was evil, but because he,~
being evil, dared to eat that which was good. Look to it well, then, brethren,~
that ye take spiritually the Bread Which cometh down from heaven. Bring~
innocency with you to the Altar. Though your sins be daily, let them not be~
deadly. Before ye draw near to the Altar, think well what it is that ye say~
"Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us." "For,~
if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive~
yoű(Matth. vi. 14) and ye may draw near boldly, for unto you It is Bread, and~
not poison.
