[Ant 1]
The child Jesus * remained in Jerusalem; and his parents knew it not. And thinking that he was in the company, they came a day's journey, and sought him among their kinsfolks and acquaintance. 

[Oratio]
Attend, O Lord, we beseech thee, of thy heavenly mercy, to the desires of thy suppliant people; and grant that they may both perceive what they ought to do, and may have strength to fulfill the same.

Szent Pál Apostolol Korintusiakhoz írt első levelének kezdete
!1 Cor 1:1-3
1 Pál, Jézus Krisztusnak Isten akaratából meghívott apostola és Szosztenész~
testvér,
2 Isten korintusi egyházának, a Krisztus Jézusban megszentelteknek, a meghívott~
szenteknek s mindazoknak, akik náluk vagy nálunk segítségül hívják Jézus~
Krisztusnak, a mi Urunknak nevét.
3 Kegyelem és békesség nektek Atyánktól, az Istentől és Jézus Krisztustól, a mi~
Urunktól!

[Lectio2]
!1 Cor 1:4-9
4 Veletek kapcsolatban szüntelenül hálát adok az Istennek azért az isteni~
kegyelemért, amelyet Krisztus Jézusban nyertetek.
5 Benne gazdagok lettetek minden tanításban és ismeretben.
6 A Krisztus melletti tanúságtétel is megszilárdult köztetek.
7 Így semmi kegyelmet sem nélkülöztök, amíg Urunk, Jézus Krisztus megjelenését~
várjátok,
8 aki mindvégig megerősít titeket, hogy feddhetetlenek legyetek Urunk, Jézus~
Krisztus napján.
9 Hűséges az Isten, aki által meghívást kaptatok Fiának, Jézus Krisztusnak, a mi~
Urunknak közösségébe.

[Lectio3]
!1 Cor 1:10-13
10 Testvérek, Urunk, Jézus Krisztus nevére kérlek titeket, éljetek mindnyájan~
egyetértésben, ne szakadjatok pártokra, legyetek egyek ugyanabban a lelkületben,~
ugyanabban a felfogásban.
11 Kloe hozzátartozói ugyanis azt a hírt hozták felőletek, testvérek, hogy~
pártokra szakadtatok.
12 Arra gondolok, hogy akadnak köztetek, akik így nyilatkoznak: "Én Pállal~
tartok, én meg Apollóval, én Kéfással, én meg Krisztussal."
13 Talán megoszlott Krisztus? Vajon Pált feszítették értetek keresztre, avagy~
Pál nevében keresztelkedtetek meg?

[Lectio4]
From the Sermons of Pope St Leo (the Great.) 4th on the Epiphany It is meet and~
right, dearly beloved brethren, yea, it is our bounden duty and godly service,~
to rejoice with full hearts upon those days which more especially set forth~
before us the workings of God's mercy; and to have in honourable memory those~
things that were done for our salvation. Hereto are we called by the seasons of~
the year which continually return, and notably by this present, which, after but a~
short time hath passed since that day whereon the Coeternal Son of God was born~
of a Virgin, bringeth now the Feast of the Epiphany, hallowed by the~
Manifestation of the Lord.

[Lectio5]
In this said Manifestation the good Providence of God hath appointed a strong~
bulwark to our faith. For now, while in solemn worship we call to mind how the~
childhood of the Saviour was adored in its first infancy, we receive from the~
original Scriptures the doctrine that Christ was born with the very nature of~
man. For this is that which maketh of sinners saints, even to believe that in~
one and the same our Lord Jesus Christ there is very Godhead and very~
Manhoodvery Godhead, as touching Which, He, being in the form of God, is equal~
to the Father from everlasting to everlasting  and very Manhood, wherein He,~
taking upon Him the form of a servant, hath in these latter days been born Man.

[Lectio6]
For the strengthening of this our faith, which we profess in the face of every~
false doctrine, the mercy of God hath made it to come to pass that one of those~
peoples who dwell in the uttermost parts of the East, and excel in the skill of~
reading the stars, should see the sign of the birth of that Child Who was to~
reign over all Israel. There appeared to the eyes of wise men a new star of such~
passing beauty, as wrought in the minds of all that saw it the persuasion that~
the event, which is announced, was of an importance not to be neglected.

[Lectio7]
From the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 2:42-51
When Jesus was twelve years old they went up to Jerusalem, after the custom of~
the Feast, and when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child~
JESUS tarried behind in Jerusalem. And so on.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!Bk. ii. on Luke ii.
We read that when He was twelve years old the Lord began to dispute. The number~
of His years was the same as the number of the Apostles whom He afterwards sent~
forth to preach the Faith. He Who, as touching His Manhood, was filled with~
wisdom and grace from God, was not careless of the parents of the same Manhood,~
and, after three days, was pleased to be found in the Temple : thereby~
foreshadowing that, after the three days of His victorious Passion, He That had~
been reckoned with the dead, would present Himself, living, to our faith, in His~
heavenly Kingship and Divine Majesty.

[Lectio8]
How is it that ye sought Me? Christ hath two Generations; one from His Father,~
another from His Mother. That from His Father is His Eternal Generation as God~
the Son; that from His Mother is that whereby He came to work for us and~
minister to us. Those acts, therefore, of His, which are above nature, beyond~
His age, and different to His custom, proceeded not from the strength of His~
Manhood, but from the power of His Godhead. On another occasion His Mother~
moveth Him to work a miracle; here He answereth her, because she treateth that~
which was of the Godhead, as though it had been of the Manhood. On this occasion~
it is said that He was twelve years old, but on the other He had already~
disciples. His mother had seen His wonders on the earlier occasion, and had~
learnt from her Son to call on the mightier nature for a work of power.

[Lectio9]
He came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them. No wonder that the great Teacher~
should practise. And shall we marvel how He Who was subject to His Mother, was~
about His Father's business? His subjection to His Mother proceeded, not from~
weakness, but from dutiful affection. Nevertheless, the false serpent lifteth~
its head from its cruel lair, and spitteth poison from its venomous breast. The~
heretics say that, as the Son was sent by the Father, therefore the Father is~
greater than the Son, and, if the Father be greater than the Son, there is that,~
than which the Son is less; yea, that He Who is sent, hath of necessity, need of~
some strengthening from outside Himself. He was subject to His Mother? Was He~
less than she? God forbid!
