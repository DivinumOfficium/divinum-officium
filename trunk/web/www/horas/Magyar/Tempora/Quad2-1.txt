Lectio sancti Evangelii secundum Joannem
!John 8:21-29
Azon időben mondá Jézus a zsidók seregeinek: Elmegyek és kerestek, de bűnötökben~
haltok meg. Ahova ugyanis én megyek, oda ti nem jöhettek. És így tovább.
_
Homily on this passage by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!Tract 38 on John.
The Lord spake unto the Jews, saying I go My way for, to the Lord Christ,~
death was a departure to that place whence He had come, and whence He had never~
departed. I go My way, saith He, and ye shall seek Me not from love, but from~
hatred. Yea after He had withdrawn Himself from the sight of men, two classes~
sought Him, even they that loved, and they that hated Him; the one because they~
longed for His presence, the other because they were fain to hunt Him down. In~
the Psalms the Lord Himself saith by His Prophet: Refuge failed me, and no man~
cared for my soul. (Ps. cxli. 5.) And again He said in another Psalm Let them~
be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul. (Ps. xxxiv.)

[Responsory1]
R. While as Jacob went from Beersheba, and hasted unto Haran, the Lord spake~
unto him, saying
* The land whereon thou sleepest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed.
V. He built an altar of stones unto the Name of the Lord, and poured oil upon~
the top of it; and God blessed him and said,:
R. The land whereon thou sleepest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed.

[Lectio2]
Thus doth He blame them that seek not, and condemn such as seek. Yea, it is a~
good thing to seek the soul of Christ, as the disciples sought it; and an evil~
thing to seek it, as the Jews sought it; the first sought it to possess, the~
second to destroy it. What then doth He bid us know will be the reward of such~
as seek it evilly in a perverse heart? Ye shall seek Me, and lest ye think that~
ye shall do well so to seek Me, I tell you that ye shall die in your sins. To~
seek Christ with bad intent, is as much as to die in sin, for it is to hate Him~
through Whom alone we can be saved.

[Responsory2]
R. God appeared unto Jacob, and blessed him, and said I am the God of Bethel,~
where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto Me.
* I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee.
V. Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not.
R. I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee.

[Lectio3]
Whereas men whose hope is in God ought to return good even for evil, those men~
returned evil for good. The Lord therefore told them beforehand, and, because He~
knew it, He let them know their coming end, how that they should die in their~
sins. Then He said farther Whither I go, ye cannot come. This He said in~
another place (xiii. 33) to His disciples, but He never said to them Ye shall~
die in your sins. What said He? The same words as to the Jews Whither I go, ye~
cannot come. Yet, to the disciples, these words only deferred, they cut not away~
hope for they, though for a little while they could not come whither He was to~
go, were yet in the end to go there. Not so they to whom He foretold and said~
Ye shall die in your sins.
