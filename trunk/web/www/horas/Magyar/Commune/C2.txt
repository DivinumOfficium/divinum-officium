Olvasmány az Apostolok Cselekedeiből
!Acts 20:17-24
17 Milétuszból üzent Efezusba, és magához kérette az egyház presbitereit.
18 Amikor megérkeztek, így szólt hozzájuk: "Tudjátok, hogy Ázsiába jövetelem első napjától kezdve minden időmet köztetek töltöttem,
19 és szolgáltam az Úrnak, teljes alázatosságban, mindenfelől szorongattatva, könnyek és megpróbáltatások közepette is, amik a zsidók áskálódásai folytán jutottak osztályrészemül.
20 Nem tagadtam meg tőletek semmit, ami javatokra szolgálhatott: prédikáltam nektek és tanítottalak benneteket, nyilvánosan és magánházaknál.
21 Zsidóknak és görögöknek egyaránt hirdettem, hogy térjenek meg az Istenhez, és higgyenek Urunkban, Jézusban.
22 Most Jeruzsálembe megyek. Nem tudom, mi lesz ott velem,
23 csak azt adta tudtomra a Szentlélek városról városra, hogy bilincs és megpróbáltatás vár rám.
24 De szóra sem tartom érdemesnek életemet, csakhogy végigfussam pályámat, és teljesítsem a feladatot, amelyet Urunk Jézus bízott rám, vagyis hogy tanúságot tegyek az Isten kegyelmét hirdető evangéliumról.

[Responsory1]
R. This man is holy, for he hath striven for the law of his God even unto death, and hath not feared for the words of the ungodly;
* For he had his foundation upon a strong rock.
V. This is he which loved not his life in this world, and is come unto an everlasting kingdom.
R. For he had his foundation upon a strong rock.

Az Apostolok Cselekedeteiből
!Acts 20:25-31
25 És tudom azt is, hogy közületek, akik között hirdettem az Isten országát, nem lát többé senki.
26 Ezért most ünnepélyesen kijelentem: nem szárad rajtam senkinek a vére.
27 Mert nem riadtam vissza semmitől, hogy az Isten akaratát teljes egészében fel ne tárjam előttetek.
28 Vigyázzatok magatokra és az egész nyájra. Azért rendelt benneteket a Szentlélek az élére elöljáróul, hogy igazgassátok az Isten egyházát, amelyet a tulajdon vére árán szerzett meg magának.
29 Tudom, hogy ha eltávozom, ragadozó farkasok törnek rátok, s nem kímélik a nyájat.
30 Közületek is akadnak majd olyanok, akik rajta lesznek, hogy álnok szóval maguk mellé állítsák a tanítványokat.
31 Ezért legyetek éberek, és véssétek jól emlékezetetekbe, hogy három éven át éjjel-nappal szünet nélkül, könnyek között figyelmeztettelek benneteket.

[Responsory2]
R. The righteous shall grow as the lily
* Yea, he shall flourish in the presence of the Lord for ever.
V. Those that be planted in the house of the Lord, shall flourish in the courts of the house of our God.
R. Yea, he shall flourish in the presence of the Lord for ever.

!Acts 20:32-38
32 Most pedig az Istennek és kegyelme szavának ajánllak benneteket. Neki hatalma van rá, hogy fölépítse művét, és megadja nektek az összes szenttel közös örökséget.
33 Senki ezüstjét, aranyát vagy ruháját nem kívántam.
34 Jól tudjátok, hogy amire magamnak és társaimnak szükségünk volt, a kezem munkájával szereztem meg.
35 Minden tekintetben példát adtam nektek, hogyan kell dolgozni, s a gyengéknek támaszukra lenni, Urunk Jézus szavaira emlékezve: Nagyobb boldogság adni, mint kapni."
36 Szavai befejeztével letérdelt, és imádkozott velük.
37 Nagy sírásban törtek ki mindnyájan, Pál nyakába borultak és összecsókolták.
38 Leginkább az a mondása fájt nekik, hogy nem látják többé viszont. Aztán kikísérték a hajóhoz.

[Responsory3]
R. This is he which knew righteousness, and saw great wonders, and made his prayer unto the Most High
* And he is numbered among the Saints.

From the Sermons of St Austin, Bishop [of Hippo.]
!44 on the Saints.
The illustrious day whereon the blessed Martyr N.  conquered, doth this day come round to us again and as the Church doth rejoice with him in his glory, so doth she set before us his footsteps to be followed. For if we suffer, we shall also reign with him. In his glorious battle we have two things chiefly to consider the hardened cruelty of the tormentor, and the unconquered patience of the Martyr the cruelty of the tormentor, that we may abhor it; the patience of the Martyr, that we may imitate it. Hear what the Psalmist saith, complaining against sin: "Fret not thyself because of the evil-doers, for they shall soon dry up like the grass." (xxxvi. 1.) But touching the patience which is to be shown against the evil-doers, hear the word wherewith the Apostle moveth us " Ye have need of patience, that ye may receive the promise." (Heb. x. 36.)

[Responsory4]
R. The Lord made him honourable, and defended him from his enemies, and kept him safe from those that lay in wait for him,
* And gave him perpetual glory.
V. He went down with him into the pit, and left him not in bonds.
R. And gave him perpetual glory.

[Lectio5]
So the patience of the blessed Martyr was crowned, and the unchastened spite of the tormentor is given over to everlasting torture. Christ's glorious champion looked for this during his battle, and shrank not from prison. Like his Head, he bore reproach, underwent mocking, and feared not for scourges and as many sufferings as for Christ's sake he bore before he died, so many offerings did he make unto Him of himself. He had drunk in the Apostles' word and kept it deep in I him: "The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us," (Rom. viii. i8,)| "for our light affliction which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and~
eternal j weight of glory." (2 Cor. iv. 17.) Being lifted up above earthly things by the love of this promise, andj tasting beforehand the sweetness of the heavenly peace, he was unspeak-, ably moved, and said with the Psalmist " What have I in heaven, and what is there upon earth that desire beside thee My flesh and' my heart faileth Thou art the God of my heart, and God is my portion for ever." (lxxii. 26.)

[Responsory5]
R. Lord, Thou hast given him his heart's desire
* And hast not withholden the request of his lips
V. For Thou hast prevented him with the blessings of sweetness: Thou hast set a crown of precious stones upon his head.
R. And hast not withholden the request of his lips

[Lectio6]
For he considered, as far as man's *â weakness is able, through this darkness, to fix the eyes of his mind upon the eternal things, what is the gladness of the city above and being not able to tell it, he cried out wondering " What have I in heaven " As though he would have said " It passeth my strength, it passeth the power of my utterance, it goeth beyond the reach of my understanding, what is that beauty, what is that glory, what is that exaltation, wherein, when He hath hidden us from the troubling of men, in the secret of His presence, our Lord Jesus Christ shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious Body " (Ps. xxx. 21, Phil. hi. 21.) In sight of this perfect liberty he shrank from no danger, and quailed before no suffering and if he could have died a thousand times, he would not have thought himself to have bought it at a price high enough.

[Responsory6]
R. The Lord hath put on him a robe of honour,
* And put about his head a crown of joy.
V. With the bread of life and understanding hath the Lord fed him, and given him the water of health and wisdom to drink.
R. And put about his head a crown of joy.
&Gloria
R. And put about his head a crown of joy.

Evangélium szent Lukács Evangélista kőnyvéből
!Luke 14:26-33
Azon időben így szólt Jézus a sokasághoz: Ha valaki követni akar, de nem gyűlöli apját, anyját, feleségét, gyermekeit, fivéreit és nővéreit, sőt még saját magát is, nem lehet a tanítványom. És így tovább.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory the Great
!Homilia 37th on the Gospels.
Dearly beloved brethren, if we consider what and how great things are promised unto us in heaven, all things which are upon earth grow poor to our mind. For when this world's goods are reckoned against the gladness above, they are found to be a clog rather than an help. This present life being compared to life eternal, ought rather to be called death than life. For what is the daily failing of our corruption but, as it were, a creeping death But what tongue is there that can tell, or what understanding that can comprehend how great is the rejoicing in the city above, where they have part with the choirs of Angels, where they stand with the most blessed spirits before the glory of the Creator, where they see the face of God present, where they behold the Incomprehensible Light, where they have no fear of death, and where they rejoice eternally incorruptible

[Responsory7]
R. A crown of gold upon his head,
* Wherein is engraved Holiness, an ornament of honour, a costly work.
V. For Thou hast prevented him with the blessings of sweetness, Thou hast set a crown of precious stones upon his head.
R. Wherein is engraved Holiness, an ornament of honour, a costly work.

[Lectio8]
Then we hear these things our hearts burn within us and we long to be already~
there, where we hope to rejoice for ever. But we cannot attain unto great~
rewards, save through great labour. Therefore saith the excellent preacher Paul " He is not crowned, except he strive lawfully." (2 Tim. ii. 5.) The greatness of the reward doth delight our mind let not the throes of the struggle dishearten us. Therefore the Truth saith unto every one that cometh unto Him " If any man come to Me, and hate not his father and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple."

[Responsory8]
R. This is a Martyr indeed, who shed his blood for Christ's Name's sake
* Who feared not for the threats of judges, nor sought to be great with the glory of this world, but pressed on unto the kingdom of heaven.
V. The Lord guided the Lord" for "Wisdom." righteous in right paths, and showed him the kingdom of God.
R. Who feared not for the threats of judges, nor sought to be great with the glory of this world, but pressed on unto the kingdom of heaven.
&Gloria
R. Who feared not for the threats of judges, nor sought to be great with the glory of this world, but pressed on unto the kingdom of heaven.

[Responsory8NonEffusorum]
R. O Lord, thou hast prevented him with blessings of sweetness:
* Thou hast set on his head a crown of precious stones.
V. He asked life of thee: and thou hast given him length of days for ever and ever.
R. Thou hast set on his head a crown of precious stones.
&Gloria
R. Thou hast set on his head a crown of precious stones.

[Lectio9]
Or it may be asked how we are commanded in one place to hate our parents, and them that are near us in the flesh, and in another place to love even our enemies. And, verily, the Truth hath said, as touching a wife " What God hath joined together, let not man put asunder." (Matth. xix. 6.) And Paul saith "~
Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the Church." (Eph. v. 25.) Behold, the disciple commandeth a man to love his wife, and the Master saith " If any man hate not his wife, he cannot be My disciple." Doth the judge, then, order one proclamation, and the crier make another? or can the man both love and hate If we consider well the force of the commandment, we shall be able in wisdom to do both. Let us love wife, and kindred, and neighbour, as touching their nearness in the flesh but as touching the way of God, if they withstand us therein, let us not know them, but hate them and flee from them.

From the Epistle of St Cyprian, Bishop [of Carthage,] and himself Martyr, to the Martyrs and Confessors.
!Bh. ii. ep. 6.
How shall I praise you, Martyrs so brilliantly victorious ? Can the voice of man's praise add anything to the glory of your manful heart and unshaken faithfulness ? Ye have borne all the hardness of the torment, and have attained unto the excellent height of glory : the tormentors have not worn you out, nay, ye rather have worn out the tormentors. When they that kill the body would give you no rest from suffering, ye suffered until ye gained the crown. And the torment waxing still more dread, waxed not to the casting down of your strong faith, but to the sooner sending God's men home to God.

[Responsory41]
R. Eternal light will shine over your saints O Lord
* And the eternity of the times, alleluja, alleluja
V. Everlasting joy shall be upon their heads, they shall obtain joy and gladness
R. And the eternity of the times, alleluja, alleluja

[Lectio51]
They that stood by looked in wonder at your heavenly conflict, that battle of God, that wrestling of spirit, that combat of Christ. There they saw His servants standing with voice unshaken, with spirit unbroken, strong in God's strength, naked indeed, as to the arms of this world, but clothed on with the armour of God, and equipped with the fiery weapons of faith. There they that were tormented stood braver than they that tormented them. Their bruised and mangled bodies overcame the instruments of cruelty that bruised and mangled them. The bloody stripes, so often laid on, could not beat down the impregnable castle of their faith, even when the covering of their bowels was broken, and that which was tormented in God's servants was no longer limbs but wounds. The blood that ran down, ran down to quench the rage of persecution, noble blood, that can put out the flames and fire of hell.

[Responsory51]
R. God will comfort Alleluja
* His servants. Alleluja, Alleluja.
V. The Lord will judge His people, and will comfort
R. His servants. Alleluja, Alleluja.

[Lectio61]
O what a spectacle was that in the eyes of the Lord! O how noble! O how mighty! O how precious in the sight of God were His soldiers' loyalty and faithfulness! Even as it is written in the Psalms, the Holy Ghost therein at once speaking to us and warning us :Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His Saints.; O what a precious death is his, who maketh purchase of life that can never die, at the price of his own blood, and seizeth on the crown, when courage hath no more left to meet ! O how joyful was Christ ! How gladly fought He in such servants as these,in these how gladly did He triumph, the Keeper of their faith,and, in the end, to them how gladly did He give that reward which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it ! (Apoc. ii. 17.) He it was, Who was there when they fought, He it was, Who raised them up to be the champions and defenders of His holy Name, He, who gave them the strength, He-, Who nerved them. He, That by death hath once conquered for us, liveth now for ever to conquer in us.

Evangélium szent János Apostol kőnyvéből
!John 15:5-10
At that time : Jesus said unto His disciples : I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in Me and I in him, the same bringeth forth much' fruit: for without Me ye can do nothing. And so on.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop [of Hippo.]
!Tract 81 on John.
Lest any man should so take these words, "the same bringeth forth much fruit," as to think that the branch can of itself bring forth any fruit whatsoever, the Lord saith further, "without Me ye can do," not only " small things," but " nothing." Whether, then, it be little or much, there can be nothing done, save through Him, without Whom we can do nothing : for if the branch bring forth fruit, albeit but little, it is through Him That purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit. And if the branch abide not in the vine, and draw not his sap from the vine's root, it can bring forth no fruit whatsoever of itself. And as Christ would not have been the vine, if He had not been man, He could not have given grace to His branches, if He had not been God.

[Responsory71]
R. I am the vine: you the branches.
* He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit alleluja, alleluja.
V. As the Father hath loved me, I also have loved you.
R. He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit alleluja, alleluja.

[Lectio81]
Whithout the sap of grace the branch cannot live, and it is within the power of his own free will to choose death rather than life. "If a man abide not in Me," saith the Lord, " he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered, and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned." So much the more worthy as is the branch of the vine, if it abide in the vine, so much the baser is it, if it abide not in the vine. Then is it as the vinebranches whereof the Prophet~
Ezekiel saith (xv. 3, 4) that wood shall not be taken thereof to do any work, and it is meet for no work. The branch hath choice of two things, the vine, or the fire : if it abide not in the vine, it shall be cast into the fire ; if, then, it would not be cast into the fire, let it abide in the vine.

[Responsory81]
R. Her Nazarites are become pure, Alleluja they reflect the glory of God, Alleluja.
* They are whiter than milk. Alleluja, Alleluja.
V. They are purer than snow, they are whiter than milk, they are more ruddy in body than coral, their polishing is of sapphire.
R. They are whiter than milk. Alleluja, Alleluja.
&Gloria
R. They are whiter than milk. Alleluja, Alleluja.

[Lectio91]
If ye abide in Me," saith the Lord, "and My words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you." And what can they will that abide in Christ, save the things of Christ ? What can they will that abide in the Saviour save such things as tend to salvation ? Since we are in Christ we will~
one thing, and since we are as yet in this world, we will another. Since we are yet in this world, it befalleth us to seek some things, whereof we know not that they be inexpedient for us. But far be it from us to think that we shall obtain them, if we abide in Christ, for, when we seek from Him, He giveth not, save that which is expedient for us.

The Lesson is taken from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 10:26-32
At that time : Jesus said unto His disciples : There is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed, and hid, that shall not be known. And so on.
_
Homily by St Hilary, Bishop (of Poitiers.)
!Comm. on Matth. Chap. 10.
The Lord pointeth to the day of judgment, that day wherein the hidden counsels of the hearts shall be made manifest, and those things which are dark now shall be the subject of all men's knowledge. Therefore He warneth us not to fear threats, nor persuasions, nor the power of such as fight against us since in the day of judgment it will be manifest that all these things are null and void. "And what I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light ; and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the house-tops." We read not that the Lord's use was to speak by night, or to tell His doctrine in darkness, but that to the carnal all His words were darkness, and to the unbelieving all His discourse night.

[Responsory72]
@Commune/C2:Responsory7

[Lectio82]
Therefore willeth He that that which He hath spoken, should be freely proclaimed in faith and in confession. Therefore commandeth He that that which He hath told in darkness shall be spoken in light, and that that which He hath made to be heard in the ear should be preached upon the house-tops, that is, with loud and high words. For it behoveth us ever to make God known, and to speak in the light of Apostolic preaching the dark things of the Gospel message, having no fear of them which have power over bodies, but none over our souls, but rather fearing God, Which is able to destroy both body and soul in hell.

[Responsory82]
@Commune/C2:Responsory8

[Lectio92]
Fear not them which kill the body. Therefore we need fear nothing which may chance to our bodies, nor sorrow because of the destruction of the flesh, when, according to the laws of our nature and that from whence we are taken, we are unclothed upon, and become a pure spirit. And, since it behoveth us who are rooted in such a doctrine, freely and constantly to confess God, even were it only because of the alternative whereby we are bound, He saith further : " Whosoever shall confess Me before men, him will I confess also before My Father, Which is in heaven. But whosoever shall deny Me before men, him will I also deny before My Father, Which is in heaven." Such witnesses as He hath seen us to have been here to His name before men, such a Witness shall we find Him to be hereafter to our names before His Father Which is in heaven.

Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 16:24-27
Azon időben így szólt Jézus a tanítványaihoz: Aki követni akar, tagadja meg magát, vegye keresztjét és kövessen. És így tovább.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great.)
!32nd on the Gospels
Our Lord and Redeemer came into the world a new Man, and gave the world new commandments. For against the ways of our old life, brought and bred up in sin, He set the contrast of His new life. It was the old way, according to the knowledge of the carnal man, for every man to keep his own goods, and, if he were able to do it, to take his neighbour's goods also, and, if he were not able to take them, at least to lust after them. But the Heavenly Physician hath medicines wherewith to meet all the diseases of sin. For, even, as by the art of the physician, things hot are healed by things cold, and things cold by things hot, so doth our Lord set against sin holiness, ordaining for the lecherous purity, for the miserly munificence, for the hot-tempered meekness, and for the proud lowliness.

[Lectio83]
So the Lord, when He would give a new commandment unto them that came to Him, said Whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be My~
disciple, (Luke xiv. 33,) as though He had said openly: All ye that according to the old man lust after your neighbour's goods, must, according to the zeal of the new man, give away even that which is your own. But let us hear again what He saith in this place If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself. First He saith that we must deny to ourselves that which is our own, and now that we must even deny ourselves to ourselves. Perchance it is not hard for a man to give up that which is his own, but it is exceeding hard to give up himself. To deny himself his possessions is little but to deny himself himself is a denial exceeding great.

[Lectio93]
Let when we come unto Him the Lord will have us deny to ourselves even ourselves, since as many of us as are entered into the battle of faith, are entered into a contention against evil spirits. But the evil spirits have nothing of their own in this world, and therefore must we wrestle with them, naked with naked. For if he that is clothed, wrestle with him that is naked, he faileth swiftly, because he hath whereon he that is naked taketh hold. And what are all things earthly but things wherewith the soul is clothed upon? whosoever therefore will wrestle with Satan, let him cast away his clothes, lest he be thereby endangered.
