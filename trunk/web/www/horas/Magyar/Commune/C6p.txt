Olvasmány szent Pál apostol Korintusiakhoz írott első leveléből
!1 Cor 7:25-31
25 A szüzeket illetően nincs külön parancsom az Úrtól, tanácsot azonban adok, mint olyan, aki az Úr irgalma folytán hitelt érdemel.
26 Azt tartom, a mostani megpróbáltatások miatt ez az állapot ajánlható; jó, ha így marad az ember.
27 Ha asszonyhoz vagy kötve, ne törekedj elválni, ha azonban nem kötötted magad asszonyhoz, ne keress feleséget.
28 De ha megnősülsz, nem vétkezel, s ha a lány férjhez megy, nem követ el bűnt. Ám az ilyeneket testi nyugtalanság gyötri, s én meg akarlak kímélni benneteket.
29 Azt mondom tehát, testvérek: Az idő rövid, azért akinek van felesége, éljen úgy, mintha nem volna,
30 aki sír, mintha nem sírna, aki örül, mintha nem örülne, aki vásárol, mintha meg sem tartaná,
31 s aki felhasználja a világ dolgait, mintha nem élne velük, mert ez a világ elmúlik.

[Responsory10]

!1 Cor 7:32-35
32 Azt szeretném, ha mentek volnátok a gondtól. A nőtlennek arra van gondja, ami az Úré: hogyan járjon az Úr kedvében.
33 A nős azonban világi dolgokkal törődik: hogyan keresse felesége kedvét,
34 ezért meg van osztva. A nem házas asszony és a szűz arra gondol, ami az Úré, hogy testben és lélekben szent legyen, míg a férjes nőt világi dolgok kötik le: hogyan járjon férje kedvében.
35 Ezt javatokra mondom, nem azért, hogy tőrbe csaljalak, hanem hogy a feddhetetlen életre és az Úrhoz való osztatlan ragaszkodásra segítselek titeket.

[Responsory2]
R. Grace is poured into thy lips, therefore
*. God hath blessed thee for ever. Alleluia
V. In thy comeliness and thy beauty, go forward, fare prosperously, and reign.
R. God hath blessed thee for ever. Alleluia

[Lectio3]
!1 Cor 7:36-40
36 Ha valaki mégis úgy véli, hogy igazságtalanul bánna hajadon lányával, mert~
eljárt fölötte az idő, ha úgy van rendjén, tegye, amit akar. Nem vétkezik, kössenek csak házasságot.
37 Akinek azonban szilárd a meggyőződése, s minden kényszerítő ok nélkül, teljesen szabadon úgy döntött, hogy megőrzi hajadon lányát, jól teszi.
38 Tehát aki férjhez adja hajadon lányát, jól teszi, aki pedig nem adja férjhez, még jobban teszi.
39 Az asszony le van kötve, amíg férje él, de ha férje meghal, felszabadul. Férjhez mehet, akihez akar, de csak az Úrban.
40 Boldogabb azonban, ha úgy marad, ahogy van. Ez a tanácsom, és hiszem, hogy Isten Lelke szerint beszélek.

[Lectio4]
From the Sermons of St Ambrose, Bishop of Milan.Book. I. on Virgins THIS day is a maiden's Birthday. The love of virginity provoketh us to say somewhat touching maidenhood, lest, if we pass thereby, we should seem to cast a slur on that which was her chief strength. Virginity is not to be praised because it is a grace which is poured forth in Martyrs, but because it is a grace which maketh Martyrs. But what understanding of man can rightly grasp this excellency which riseth above the laws of nature herself? What natural voice can pourtray a thing which is supernaturally noble? It is a reflection on earth of a glory whose home is in heaven. And it is but that which we may justly look for, when we see her who hath her Husband in heaven, live a life whose model is the life of heaven.

[Responsory4]
R. Because of truth, and meekness, and righteousness
* And thy right hand shall lead thee wonderfully. Alleluia
V. In thy comeliness, and thy beauty, go forward, fare prosperously, and reign.
R. And thy right hand shall lead thee wonderfully. Alleluia

[Lectio5]
It was maidenhood that pierced -*â beyond the clouds, the atmosphere, the Angels, and the stars, and came upon the Word of God in the very bosom of the Father, and sucked Him into her heart. For who, that hath once found such blessedness, would leave it again "For thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee," and draw thee after them. (Cant. i. 3.) Lastly, it is not I, but the Lord by Whom it is said that they which neither marry nor are given in marriage are as the angels of God in heaven. (Matth. xxii. 30.) Let no man therefore marvel that they which be married unto the Lord of angels should be likened themselves to angels.

[Responsory5]
R. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity
* Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness. Alleluia
V. Because of truth, and meekness, and righteousness.
R. Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil

[Lectio6]
Who would deny that this is a life which hath come down from heaven, seeing it is a life whereof it is not easy to find an example before God came down to dwell in a Body of clay? Then was it a virgin which conceived Him in her womb, and the Word was made Flesh, that Flesh might be made God. Some will say Concerning Elias also, we find not that he shared in the lusting after a bodily~
coming-together. Yea and therefore it is that he was carried up in a fiery chariot into heaven therefore is it that he is seen with the Lord amid all the glory of the Transfiguration therefore it is that he is to come as a Forerunner of the Lord's coming again.

[Responsory6]
R. After her shall virgins be brought unto the King, her fellows
* They shall be brought unto thee with gladness and rejoicing. Alleluia
V. In thy comeliness and thy beauty, go forward, fare prosperously, and reign.
R. They shall be brought unto thee with gladness and rejoicing. Alleluia
&Gloria
R. They shall be brought unto thee with gladness and rejoicing. Alleluia

Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 25:1 
Azon időben így szólt Jézus tanítványaihoz A mennyek országa hasonlít a tíz szűzhöz, akik fogták lámpásukat, és a vőlegény elé mentek. És így tovább.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory the Great.
!12th on the Gospels. 
Dearly beloved brethren oftentimes do I warn you to fly corrupt conversation, and to keep yourselves unspotted from the world. But the portion which is this day read from the Holy Gospel doth oblige me to say that even to these good things which ye do, ye must needs take all careful heed. Look ye well to it, that, when ye work righteousness, ye do it not as seeking the praise and admiration of men, for if the lust of praise do once creep in, that which seemeth so fair without, loseth its reward within. Behold how the Redeemer speaketh of these ten virgins. He calleth them all virgins, yet entered not all of them into the door of blessedness, for there were some of them who sought outwardly the honour of virginity, but would take no oil within their vessels with their lamps.

[Responsory7]
R. This is one of those wise virgins, whom the Lord found watching, for when she took her lamp, she took oil with her.
* And when the Lord came, she went in with him to the marriage. Alleluia
V. At midnight there was a cry made Behold the Bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him
R. And when the Lord came, she went in with him to the marriage. Alleluia

[Lectio8]
First of all, it is for us to ask What is the kingdom of Heaven? And wherefore shall the same be likened unto ten virgins, whereof, albeit five were wise, yet five were foolish For if the kingdom of heaven be such that there shall in no wise enter into it anything that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie, (Apoc. xxi. 27,) how can it be like unto five virgins which were foolish? But we must know that, in the word of God, the kingdom of heaven doth oftentimes signify the Church as she now is, touching the which the Lord saith in another place " The Son of Man shall send forth His Angels, and they shall gather out of His kingdom all things that offend." (Matth. xiii. 41.) In that kingdom of Blessedness, wherein peace shall have her perfect reign, there shall be nothing found that offendeth for the angels to gather out.

[Responsory8]
R. At midnight there was a cry made
* Behold the Bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him. Alleluia
V. Trim your lamps, O ye wise virgins.
R. Behold the Bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him. Alleluia
&Gloria
R. Behold the Bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him. Alleluia

[Lectio9]
The body of every man doth consist of five senses, and five being doubled, is ten. Forasmuch, therefore, as the whole body of the faithful doth consist of two sexes, the Holy Church is likened unto ten virgins. And forasmuch as in the Church the good are for the present mingled with the bad, and the reprobate with the elect, it is rightly said that, of the ten virgins, five are wise and five are foolish. There are many who have self-control, which do keep themselves from lusting after things outward, whose hope beareth them to things inward, who chastise the flesh, who long with intense home-sickness for their Fatherland which is in heaven, who seek an eternal reward, and who will not to receive for their labours the praise of men. These are they who reckon their glory, not in the mouths of men, but in the testimony of their own conscience. And many there be likewise who afflict the body by self-control, and yet who seek for their self-control applause from men.
