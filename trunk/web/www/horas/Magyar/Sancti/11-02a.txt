Evangélium szent Máte Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 5:1-12
 A tömeg láttára fölment a hegyre és leült. Tanítványai köréje gyűltek És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!Bk. i. on the Lord's Sermon.
 Blessed are the poor in spirit. If blessedness is to attain unto the highest~
wisdom, it must needs be that it begin by the being poor in spirit. The fear of~
the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, (Ps. ex. 10,) even as, on the other hand,~
it is written that pride is the beginning of all sin. (Ecclus. x. i 5.) The~
proud covet and love earthly kingdoms. Blessed are the meek, for they shall~
inherit the earth. The earth which they shall inherit I believe to be that earth~
whereof it is written in the cxli. Psalm, Thou art my refuge, and my portion in~
the land of the living. (6) And the heritage of the meek in this land is an~
heritage everlastingly sure and fixed, wherein the soul resteth by good will, at~
home there, as carnal owners rest at home in sure earthly possessions; and on~
the income from that land they live, as earthly owners from the income of~
earthly possessions; this is the home and the abiding-place of the Saints. And~
the meek heirs are they who when they be evil-entreated, suffer it, and are not~
overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. (Rom. xii. 21.)
