[Responsory1]
R. Maiden Lucy, why seekest thou of me that which thou thyself canst presently~
give thy mother? For thy faith hath holpen her, and, behold, she is made whole
* Because thou hast made in thy virginity a pleasant dwelling-place for thy God.
V. Even as Christ hath by me glorified Catania, so by thee shall He glorify~
Syracuse.
R. Because thou hast made in thy virginity a pleasant dwellingplace for thy God.

[Responsory2]
R. I besought my Lord Jesus Christ that this fire might not take hold upon me
* And I obtained from the Lord that I should not finish my testimony for yet a~
while.
V. For so much as they loved me, so bitterly spake they against me: but I gave~
myself unto prayer. 
R. And I obtained from the Lord that I should not finish my testimony for yet a~

shall not be moved.

[Lectio94]
Lucy a virgin of Syracuse, noble by birth and by her Christian faith, went to~
the tomb of St. Agatha at Catheria and obtained the cure of her.mother, Eutichia~
who was suffering from a hemorrhage. Soon after, she gained her mother's~
permission to distribute to .the poor all the possessions which were to have~
served as her dowry. As a result of this charitable action, she was accused of~
being a Christian and brought before Paschasius the Prefect. When neither~
promises nor threats could induce her to sacrifice the idols, Paschasius became~
enraged and commanded Lucy to be taken to a place where her virginity would be~
violated. But the power of God gave the virgin a strength that matched the~
firmness of her resolution, so that no force could move her where she stood. And~
so the prefect commanded a fire to be kindled all around here, but the flames~
did not harm her. After she had suffered many torments, therefore her throat was~
pierced through with a sword. So wounded she foretold that the Church would have~
peace after the deaths of Diocletian and Maximilian, and on December 13 she gave~
up her spirit, to God. Her body was first buried at Syracuse, than taken to~
Constantinople, and finally transferred to Venice.
