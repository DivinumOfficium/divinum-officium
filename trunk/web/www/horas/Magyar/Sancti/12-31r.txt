Olvasmány szent Pál apostol Rómaiakhoz irott levelébõl
!Rom 3:19-22
19 Mi azonban tudjuk, hogy amit a törvény mond, azokra vonatkozik, akik a törvénynek alá vannak vetve. Tehát némuljon el minden száj, és az egész világ vallja magát Isten elõtt bûnösnek. 
20 Mert a törvény szerinti tettek senkit sem tesznek elõtte igazzá, hiszen a bûn megismerésének is a törvény az alapja. 
21 Most azonban az Isten elõtti megigazulás a törvénytõl függetlenül lett nyilvánvalóvá, amint a törvény és a próféták is tanúsítják: 
22 az az Isten elõtti megigazulás, amely a Jézus Krisztusban való hitbõl ered, és amely minden hívõnek szól. Ebben nincs különbség.

!Rom 3:23-26
23 Mert mindnyájan vétkeztek, és nélkülözik az Isten dicsõségét. 
24 Megigazulásukat azonban ingyen kapják, Isten kegyelmének erejébõl, Jézus Krisztus megváltása árán. 
25 Õt adta oda Isten véres engesztelõ áldozatul a hitben, hogy kimutassa igazságosságát. Isten végtelen türelmében elnézte a korábban elkövetett vétkeket, 
26 hogy igazságosságát most kimutassa. Mert amint õ igaz, úgy akar igazzá tenni mindenkit, aki Jézusban hisz. 

[Responsory2]
R. O ye shepherds, speak, and tell us what ye have seen; who is appeared in the~
earth?
* We saw the new-born Child, and Angels singing praise to the Lord.
V. Speak; what have ye seen? And tell us of the Birth of Christ.
R. We saw the new-born Child, and Angels singing praise to the Lord.
V. Glória Patri, et Fílio, * et Spirítui Sancto.
R. We saw the new-born Child, and Angels singing praise to the Lord.

!Rom 3:27-31
27 Hol marad tehát dicsekvésed? Szétfoszlott. Mely törvény alapján? Vajon a tettek törvénye alapján? Nem, hanem a hit törvénye szerint. 
28 Mi azt valljuk, hogy az ember a hit által válik igazzá, a törvény szerint tettektõl függetlenül. 
29 Vajon csak a zsidóké az Isten, s nem a pogányoké is? Bizony a pogányoké is. 
30 Ugyanaz az Isten teszi megigazulttá a hitbõl a körülmetéltet éppúgy, mint hite által a körülmetéletlent. 
31 Ilyenformán megszüntetjük a törvényt a hittel? Szó sincs róla! Ellenkezõleg: erõsítjük a törvényt.

[Lectio4]
Sylvester was a Roman by birth, and his father's name was Rufinus. He was~
brought up from a very early age under a Priest named Cyrinus, of whose teaching~
and example he was a diligent learner. In his thirtieth year he was ordained~
Priest of the Holy Roman Church by Pope Marcellinus. In the discharge of his~
duties he became a model for all the clergy, and, after the death of Melchiades,~
he succeeded him on the Papal throne, (in the year of our Lord 314,) during the~
reign of Constantine, who had already by public decree proclaimed peace to the~
Church of Christ. Hardly had he undertaken the government of the Church when he~
betook himself to stir up the Emperor to protect and propagate the religion of~
Christ. Constantine was fresh from his victory over his enemy Maxentius, on the~
Eve whereof the sign of the Cross had been revealed to him limned in light upon~
the sky; and there was an old story in the Church of Rome that it was Silvester~
who caused him to recognise the images of the Apostles, administered to him holy~
Baptism, and cleansed him from the leprosy of misbelief.

[Lectio5]
The godly Emperor had already granted to Christ's faithful people permission to~
build public churches, and by the advice of Silvester he himself set them the~
example. He built many Basilicas, and magnificently adorned them with holy~
images, and gifted them with gifts and endowments. Among these there were,~
besides others, the Church of Christ the Saviour, hard by the Lateran Palace;~
that of St Peter, upon the Vatican Mount; that of St Paul, upon the road to~
Ostia; that of St Lawrence, in Verus' field; that of the Holy Cross at the~
Sessorian hall; that of St Peter and St Marcellinus, upon the Lavican Way; and~
that of St Agnes, upon the road to Mentana. Under this Pope was held the first~
Council of Nice, presided over by the Papal Legates, and in the Presence of~
Constantine, and three hundred and eighteen Bishops, where the holy and Catholic~
Faith was declared, and Arius and his followers condemned; which Council was~
finally confirmed by the Pope, at the request of all the assembled Fathers, in a~
synod held at Rome, where Arius was again condemned. This Pope issued many~
useful ordinances for the Church of God. He reserved to Bishops the right of~
consecrating the Holy Chrism; ordered Priests to anoint with Chrism the heads of~
the newly baptised; settled the officiating dress of Deacons as a dalmatic and a~
linen maniple; and forbade the consecration of the Sacrament of the Altar on~
anything but a linen corporal.

[Lectio6]
This Silvester is likewise said to have ordained that all persons taking Holy~
Orders should remain awhile in each grade before being promoted to a higher;~
that laymen should not go to law against the clergy; and that the clergy~
themselves were not to plead before civil tribunals. He decreed that the first~
and seventh days of the week should be called respectively the Lord's Day and~
the Sabbath, and the others, Second Day, Third Day, and so on. In this he~
confirmed the use of the word Feria for the weekdays, the which use had~
already begun in the Church. This word signifieth an holiday, and pointeth to~
the duty of the clergy ever to lay aside all worldly labour, and leave~
themselves free to do continually the work of the Lord. The heavenly wisdom with~
which he ruled the Church of God, was joined in him to a singular holiness of~
life, and an inexhaustible tenderness towards the poor; in which matter he~
ordained that the wealthy clergy should each relieve a certain number of needy~
persons; and he also made arrangements for supplying the consecrated virgins~
with the necessaries of life. He lived as Pope twenty - one years, ten months~
and one day, and was buried in the cemetery of Priscilla on the Salarian Way,~
(in the year 335.) He held seven Advent ordinations, and made forty-two Priests,~
twenty-five Deacons, and sixty-five Bishops of various sees.
