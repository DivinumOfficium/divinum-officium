[Hymnus Vespera]
{:H-Isteconfessor:}v. Im a hitvallĂł, kit a fĂśld hatĂĄrĂĄn

JĂĄmbor, jĂłzan volt, okos ĂŠs szemĂŠrmes.

MĂ­g embertestĂŠt eleven tĂźzĂŠvel
Lakta a lĂŠlek.

IstentĂ´l immĂĄr, magas ĂŠrdemĂŠĂŠrt,
Sok szegĂŠny testnek, kit igĂĄz betegsĂŠg.

VisszakĂśnyĂśrgĂŠ.

[Lectio1]
From the letter of St Paul to the Galatians.
!Gal 5:25-26; 6:1-6
25 Ha a LĂŠlek szerint ĂŠlĂźnk, viselkedjĂźnk is a LĂŠleknek megfelelĂľen.
26 Ne tĂśrtessĂźnk kihĂ­vĂłan s egymĂĄsra irigykedve hiĂş dicsĂľsĂŠg utĂĄn.
1 TestvĂŠrek, ha valakit botlĂĄson ĂŠrtek, ti akik lelkiek vagytok, intsĂŠtek meg a~
szelĂ­dsĂŠg szellemĂŠben. De Ăźgyelj, hogy magad kĂ­sĂŠrtĂŠsbe ne essĂŠl!
2 HordozzĂĄtok egymĂĄs terhĂŠt, Ă­gy teljesĂ­titek Krisztus tĂśrvĂŠnyĂŠt.
3 Aki bekĂŠpzeli magĂĄnak, hogy valaki, holott semmi, ĂśnmagĂĄt ĂĄltatja.
4 Mindenki a sajĂĄt tetteit tegye mĂŠrlegre, dicsekvĂŠsĂŠt pedig tartsa meg magĂĄnak,~
ne tĂĄrja mĂĄsok elĂŠ.
5 Hiszen mindenkinek a maga terhĂŠt kell hordoznia.
6 Akit a (keresztĂŠny) igazsĂĄgokra tanĂ­tanak, engedjen rĂŠszt tanĂ­tĂłjĂĄnak minden~
javĂĄbĂłl.

[Lectio2]
!Gal 6:7-13
7 Ne ĂĄltassĂĄtok magatokat, Isten nem hagy magĂĄbĂłl gĂşnyt Ăťzni. Amit az ember vet,~
azt is aratja.
8 Aki tehĂĄt test szerint vet, testĂŠbĂľl is arat majd romlĂĄst. Aki ellenben a~
lĂŠlek szerint vet, lelkĂŠbĂľl arat ĂśrĂśk ĂŠletet.
9 Ne fĂĄradjunk bele tenni a jĂłt, mert ha kitartunk, annak idejĂŠn aratni is~
fogunk.
10 AmĂ­g tehĂĄt idĂľnk van, tegyĂźnk jĂłt mindenkivel, fĂľkĂŠppen hittestvĂŠreinkkel.
11 NĂŠzzĂŠtek, mekkora betĂťkkel Ă­rok nektek a sajĂĄt kezemmel!
12 Akik test szerint akarnak tetszeni, kĂśrĂźlmetĂŠlkedĂŠsre kĂŠnyszerĂ­tenek titeket,~
csak azĂŠrt, hogy Krisztus keresztjĂŠĂŠrt ne szenvedjenek ĂźldĂśzĂŠst.
13 Hiszen maguk a kĂśrĂźlmetĂŠltek sem tartjĂĄk meg a tĂśrvĂŠnyt. CsupĂĄn azĂŠrt~
kĂ­vĂĄnjĂĄk a ti kĂśrĂźlmetĂŠlĂŠseteket, hogy testetekkel dicsekedhessenek.

[Lectio3]
!Gal 6:14-18
14 Ăn azonban nem akarok mĂĄssal dicsekedni, mint Urunk, JĂŠzus Krisztus~
keresztjĂŠvel. Ăltala keresztre szegeztĂŠk nekem a vilĂĄgot, ĂŠs engem is a~
vilĂĄgnak.
15 Mert sem a kĂśrĂźlmetĂŠltsĂŠg nem ĂŠr semmit, sem a kĂśrĂźlmetĂŠletlensĂŠg, hanem csak~
az Ăşj teremtmĂŠny.
16 BĂŠke ĂŠs irgalom mindazoknak, akik ezt a szabĂĄlyt kĂśvetik, Isten (igaz)~
IzraelĂŠnek!
17 EzutĂĄn senki ne okozzon kellemetlensĂŠget nekem, mert JĂŠzus jegyeit viselem~
testemen.
18 A mi Urunk, JĂŠzus Krisztus kegyelme legyen lelketekkel, testvĂŠrek! Amen.

[Lectio4]
From the Readings upon the Life of St Francis, composed by St Buona- Ventura,~
Cardinal Bishop (of Albano.)
!Chapter 13.
Francis being indeed a faithful servant and minister of Christ, about the space~
of two years before he gave back his spirit to heaven, withdrew himself into an~
high mountain apart, even that mountain which is called Mount Alverno, and began~
to fast for forty days to the honour of the Archangel Michael. To think of the~
things above gave him sweeter comfort than beforetime he was wont, and the hot~
longing for heaven was kindled in him, so that he began to feel that the gifts~
from above were poured forth upon him in such fulness as he had never felt~
before. The burning of his desire made his heart rise towards God like the heart~
of a seraph, and his tender answering love yearned to be changed into the~
likeness of Him Who hath so loved us that He was content to bear the Cross. And~
it was so that one morning early, about the time of the Feast of the Exaltation~
of the Holy Cross, he was praying upon the side of the mountain, and there~
appeared unto him as it had been one of the Seraphim, having six wings, glorious~
and fiery, flying to him from heaven. It came therefore very swiftly, and stood~
in the air, hard by the man of God. He beheld then the appearance thereof that~
it was not winged only, but crucified also. His hands and feet were stretched~
forth and nailed to a Cross. Twain of his wings were lifted up and joined one to~
the other over his head, and twain were stretched forth to fly withal, and with~
twain he wrapped around his body. When Francis saw it, he was sore amazed, and~
his soul was.filled with sorrow and gladness, for the eyes of him that appeared~
were full of strange love and tenderness, so that he conceived great rejoicing~
thereat, but the nailing to the Cross was so exceedingly dreadful, that as he~
saw it, a sword of sorrow pierced his soul.

[Lectio5]
Then He Whom he beheld with his bodily eyes, began to speak silently unto him in~
his heart, and he understood that albeit the deathless Seraphim cannot suffer or~
faint, this vision was nevertheless therefore set before him, that he might know~
that as a friend of Christ he was to be all changed into the likeness of Christ~
Jesus crucified, not by the martyrdom of the body, but by the fervour of the~
soul. Then they held together some sweet converse, as of a man with his friend,~
and the vision passed from him, but his heart was kindled inwardly with the fire~
of the Seraphim, and his body was outwardly changed into the likeness of Him Who~
was crucified, even as wax is softened by the fire and taketh the impression of~
the seal. From thenceforth there were in his hands and feet the marks of the~
nails. The heads of the nails were seen in the palms of his hands and on the~
insteps of his feet, and the points came out on the backs of his hands and the~
soles of his feet. In his right side also was a long raw wound, as though he had~
been pierced with a spear, from which wound his holy blood oftentimes ran and~
stained his shirt and breeches.

[Lectio6]
Thereafter Francis was a newcreature, famous for a new and awful sign. The holy~
marks of the Lord Jesus, whereon living man for twelve centuries had not been~
allowed to look, were his adornment. He came down from the mount bearing in~
himself the form of Jesus Crucified, not pourtrayed upon tables of stone or wood~
by the hand of any earthly craftsman, but drawn upon his flesh by the finger of~
the living God. The dying Seraph knew well that it is good to keep close the~
secret of a king, (Tobit xii. 7,) and knowing the secret of his King, he strove~
as far as in him lay to keep the sacred marks hidden from men. Nevertheless,~
forasmuch as it is the will of the Lord God for His Own glory to make manifest~
the greatness of His Own works, He openly showed forth divers wonders through~
these wounds which He had Himself made in secret, so that the hidden and~
wondrous power of the marks might become known by the fame of the miracles. The~
foregoing marvellous but thoroughly witnessed facts, which were already spoken~
of in Papal documents with especial praise and joy, were made, by the pleasure~
of Pope Benedict XL, the subject of a yearly memorial, which was afterwards~
extended by Paul V. to the whole Church, in the hope of fanning in the hearts of~
the faithful the love of Christ Crucified.

Francis, by a singular privilege, was adorned with the holy marks of the Lord Jesus, whereon living man for twelve centuries had not been allowed to look.
