[Oratio]
O God, Who, year by year, dost gladden us by the solemn Feast-day of thy blessed~
Confessor beati Hyacinthi, mercifully grant unto all who keep his birthday, grace to follow~
after the pattern of his godly conversation. 
$Per Dominum

[Lectio4]
Hyacinth was a Pole, and was born (in the year 1185) of the noble and Christian~
family (of the Counts of Odrowatz,) in the town of Camien, in the diocese of~
Wratislaw. He was trained up in learning from his youth, and after studying law~
and theology, became a Canon of Crakow, where he was eminent above his fellows~
by the singular godliness of his life and the depth of his learning. Being at~
Rome, (in 1218,) he was received into the Order of Friars Preachers by the~
Founder, St Dominick, himself, and kept in holiness to the end of his life the~
rule of perfect living which he had learnt from him. He remained always a virgin,~
and loved modesty, long-suffering, lowliness, self- restraint, and all other~
good graces as his heritage in the life of a Friar.

[Lectio5]
In the heat of his love for God, he sometimes passed whole nights in pouring~
forth prayers and chastising his body, to which he never gave rest but in~
leaning against a stone or lying upon the ground. He was sent back to his own~
country, and, on the way, founded a very large house of his Order at Friesach~
and soon afterwards another at Crakow. In other provinces of the kingdom of~
Poland he founded four others, and it passeth belief what success he had with~
all kinds of men, by his preaching of the Word of God, and the innocency of his~
life. Not a day passed wherein he did not display some bright gift of faith,~
godliness, or innocency.

[Lectio6]
The zeal of this most holy man for the salvation of his neighbours was that~
which God marked by His greatest miracles. Among these is famous the time when~
coming to the River Vistula near Wisgrade, and finding it in flood, he crossed~
it without a boat, drawing over also his three companions standing upon the~
waves upon his outspread mantle. He led a wonderful life for nearly forty years~
after his profession, and then foretold to his brethren the day of his death.~
Upon the very day of the Feast of the Assumption of the Virgin, he finished the~
recitation of the Office of the Church, received the Sacraments with the utmost~
reverence, and then with the words, Into thy hands, O Lord, gave up his soul to~
God in the year of salvation 1257. He was illustrious for miracles even after~
his death, and Pope Clement VIII. numbered him among the saints.
