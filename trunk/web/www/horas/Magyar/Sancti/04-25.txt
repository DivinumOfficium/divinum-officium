[Oratio]
Q God, Who didst exalt thy blessed Evangelist Mark, by giving him grace to~
preach thine Evangel, grant unto us, we beseech thee, ever to follow more and~
more what he teacheth, and ever to be shielded from all evil by his prayers.
$Per Dominum

[Lectio4]
From the Book upon Church Writers, composed by St Jerome, Priest at Bethlehem.~
Mark was the disciple and interpreter of Peter, and it was from what he had~
heard' Peter tell, that, at the request of the brethren at Rome, he wrote the~
shortest of the Gospels. When Peter had heard it, he approved it, and gave it to~
the Church to be read, by his authority. Mark betook himself to Egypt, with the~
Gospel which he had compiled, and was the first man who preached Christ at~
Alexandria. There he founded a Church with such teaching and austerity of life,~
that all who followed Christ were constrained to imitate him.

[Lectio5]
Last of all, Philo, that most learned Jew, observing that the first Church of~
Alexandria still kept the law of Moses, wrote a book concerning their manners,~
as if in praise of his own nation, wherein he saith that under the teaching of~
Mark, the Christians of Alexandria had all things in common, just as Luke~
telleth us was the case with all them that believed at Jerusalem. Mark died in~
the eighth year of Nero, and was buried at Alexandria. Anianus succeeded him.

[Lectio6]
From the Exposition of the Book of the Prophet Ezekiel by Pope St Gregory the Great.
!Hom 3, Bk. i.
The Prophet writeth very minutely touching the four holy living creatures, whom~
he saw in the spirit as being to come. He saith "Every one had four faces,~
and every one had four wings." What signifieth the face save likeness whereby we~
are known? or wings, save the power to fly since it is by the face that man is~
known from man, and by their wings that the birds' bodies are carried up into~
the air. So the face pertaineth to certitude, and the wings to contemplation.~
With certitude we are known of God Almighty, Who saith "I am the Good~
Shepherd, and know My sheep, and am known of Mine. (John x. 14.) And again "I~
know whom I have chosen." (xiii. 18.) And by contemplation, whereby we rise~
above ourselves, we as it were fly heavenwards.
