[Ant Vespera]
God bless thee, precious cross, * be welcome to the follower of Him That hung on thee, even my Master Christ.
The blessed Andrew prayed and said * O Lord, King of everlasting glory, receive me hanging on this gallows.
Andrew was the servant of Christ, * a worthy Apostle of God, the brother of Peter, and likened to Christ and to Peter in his death.
Christ's dear handmaid Maximilla took the body * of the Apostle and buried it with spices in an honourable place.
O Lord, Thou hast caused them that persecuted the just to be swallowed up in hell, * but to the just Thou hast thyself shown the way on the tree of the cross

Olvasmány szent Pál apostol Rómaiakhoz írott leveléből
!Rom 10:4-9
4 Márpedig a törvény végső célja Krisztus, minden hívő megigazulására.
5 Mózes azt írja a törvényből eredő megigazulásról, hogy aki megtartja, élni fog~
általa.
6 Ugyanakkor a hitből származó megigazulásról így szól: Ne kérdezd bensődben:~
"Ki megy föl az égbe?" Azért tudniillik, hogy Krisztust lehozza.
7 Vagy: "Ki száll le az alvilágba?" Azért tudniillik, hogy Krisztust a holtak~
országából felhozza.
8 Hanem hogyan mondja? Közel van hozzád a tanítás, ajkadon és szívedben,~
tudniillik a hit tanítása, amit hirdetünk.
9 Ha tehát száddal vallod, hogy Jézus az Úr, és szívedben hiszed, hogy Isten~
feltámasztotta a halálból, üdvözülsz.

[Responsory1]
R. The Lord, walking by the Sea of Galilee, saw Peter and Andrew casting their~
nets into the sea, and He called them saying
* Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.
V. For they were fishers, and He saith unto them
R. Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.

[Lectio2]
!Rom 10:10-15
10 A szívbeli hit ugyanis megigazulásra, a szájjal való megvallás pedig~
üdvösségre szolgál.
11 Az Írás ugyanis azt mondja: Senki nem vall szégyent, aki benne hisz.
12 Nincs különbség zsidó meg pogány között, mert mindnyájunknak egy az Ura, aki~
bőkezű mindazokhoz, akik segítségül hívják.
13 Mindenki, aki segítségül hívja az Úr nevét, üdvözül.
14 De hogyan hívhatják segítségül, amíg nem hisznek benne? S hogyan higgyenek~
abban, akiről nem hallottak? S hogyan halljanak róla, ha nincs, aki hirdesse?
15 S hogyan hirdesse az, akit nem küldtek? Ezért meg van írva: "Milyen kedves a~
jövetele annak, aki jó hírt hoz."

[Responsory2]
R. As soon as the blessed Andrew heard the voice of the Lord calling him, he~
left his nets, by the exercise and use whereof he lived
* And followed Him Who giveth life everlasting.
V. This is that disciple who for the love of Christ hung upon the cross, and~
suffered for the law of his God.
R. And followed Him Who giveth life everlasting.

[Lectio3]
!Rom 10:16-21
16 De nem mindnyájan engedelmeskednek az evangéliumnak. Ezért kérdi Izajás is:~
"Uram, ki fogadja hittel a szavunkat?"
17 A hit tehát hallásból fakad, a hallás pedig Krisztus tanításából.
18 De kérdezem, vajon nem hallották? Hiszen: Végig a földön szárnyal a szavuk, a~
világ végéig elhat szózatuk.
19 Tovább kérdem: Vajon Izrael nem értette meg? Már Mózes megfelelt rá:~
Féltékenységre ingerellek azok ellen, akik nem népem, haragra gerjesztelek az~
értelmetlen nép ellen.
20 Izajás meg nyíltan mondja: Aki nem keresett, rám talált, fölismert, aki~
utánam nem járt.
21 Izraelhez azonban így szólt: "Naphosszat a hitetlen és ellenszegülő nép felé~
tárom karomat."

[Responsory3]
R. Andrew the good teacher, the friend of God, was led to the cross, and when he~
saw it afar off, he said God bless thee, O cross
* Welcome to the follower of Him That hung on thee, even my Master Christ.
V. God bless thee, O cross, thou art hallowed by the Body of Christ; His Members~
make thee goodly as with pearls.
R. Be welcome to the follower of Him That hung on thee, even my Master Christ.
&Gloria
R. Be welcome to the follower of Him That hung on thee, even my Master Christ.

[Lectio4]
The Apostle Andrew was born at Bethsaida, a town of Galilee, and was the brother~
of Peter. He was a disciple of John the Baptist, and heard him say of Christ,~
Behold the Lamb of God, (John i. 35-37, 40,) whereupon he immediately followed~
Jesus, bringing his brother also with him. Some while after, they were both~
fishing in the Sea of Galilee, and the Lord Christ, going by, called them both,~
before any other of the Apostles, in the words, Follow Me, and I will make you~
fishers of men. They made no delay, but left their nets, and followed Him.~
~(Matth. iv. 18-20.) After the death and Resurrection of Christ, Andrew was~
allotted Scythia as the province of his preaching, and, after labouring there,~
he went through Epirus and Thrace, where he turned vast multitudes to Christ by~
his teaching and miracles. Finally he went to Patras in Achaia, and there also~
he brought many to the knowledge of Gospel truth. Aegeas the Pro-consul resisted~
the preaching of the Gospel, and the Apostle freely rebuked him, bidding him~
know that while he held himself a judge of his fellow men, he was himself~
hindered by devils from knowing Christ our God, the Judge of all.

[Responsory4]
R. The man of God was led to be crucified, and the people cried with a loud~
voice, saying
* The innocent blood of this just person is condemned without a cause.
V. And when they led him out to crucify him, all the people ran together and~
cried, saying
R. The innocent blood of this just person is condemned without a cause.

[Lectio5]
Then Egeas, being angry, answered him, Boast no more of this thy Christ. He~
spake words even such as thine, but they availed Him not, and He was crucified~
by the Jews. Whereto Andrew boldly answered that Christ had given Himself up to~
die for man's salvation; but the Pro-consul blasphemously interrupted him, and~
bade him look to himself, and sacrifice to the gods. Then said Andrew, We have~
an altar, whereon day by day I offer up to God, the Almighty, the One, and the~
True, not the flesh of bulls nor the blood of goats, but a Lamb without spot and~
when all they that believe have eaten of the Flesh Thereof, the Lamb That was~
slain abideth whole and liveth. Then Aegeas being filled with wrath, bound the~
Apostle in prison. Now, the people would have delivered him, but he himself~
calmed the multitude, and earnestly besought them not to take away from him the~
crown of martyrdom, for which he longed and which was now drawing near.

[Responsory5]
R. O precious cross, which the Members of my Lord have made so fair and goodly,~
welcome me from among men, and join me again to my Master,
* That, as by thee He redeemed me, so by thee also He may take me unto Himself.
V. The blessed Andrew stretched forth his hands to heaven and prayed, saying~
Precious cross, be my salvation,
R. That, as by thee He redeemed me, so by thee also He may take me unto Himself.

[Lectio6]
Come short while after, he was brought before the judgment-seat, where he~
extolled the mystery of the cross, and rebuked Aegeas for his ungodliness. Then~
Aegeas could bear with him no longer, but commanded him to be crucified, in~
imitation of Christ. Andrew, then, was led to the place of martyrdom, and, as~
soon as he came in sight of the cross, he cried out, O precious cross, which the~
Members of my Lord have made so goodly, how long have I desired thee! how warmly~
have I loved thee! how constantly have I sought thee! And, now that thou art~
come to me, how is my soul drawn to thee! Welcome me from among men, and join me~
again to my Master, that as by thee He redeemed me, so by thee also He may take~
me unto Himself. So he was fastened to the cross, whereon he hung living for two~
days, during which time he ceased not to preach the faith of Christ, and,~
finally, passed into the Presence of Him the likeness of Whose death he had~
loved so well. All the above particulars of his last sufferings were written by~
the Priests and Deacons of Achaia, who bear witness to them of their own~
knowledge. Under the Emperor Constantine the bones of the Apostle were first~
taken to Constantinople, whence they were afterwards brought to Amalfi. In the~
Pontificate of Pope Pius II. his head was carried to Rome, where it is kept in~
the Basilica of St Peter.

[Responsory6]
R. All day long I have stretched forth my hands upon the cross unto a~
disobedient and gainsaying people
* Which walketh in a way that is not good, but after their own sins.
V. The Lord God to Whom vengeance belongeth, the God to Whom vengeance~
belongeth, hath shown Himself: lift up thyself, Thou Judge of the earth, render a~
reward to the proud.
R. Which walketh in a way that is not good, but after their own sins.
&Gloria
R. Which walketh in a way that is not good, but after their own sins.

Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 4:18-22
Abban az időben Jézus a Galileai-tó mellett járt, látott két testvért, Simont,~
másik nevén Pétert és testvérét, Andrást. Halászok voltak, s épp hálót vetettek a~
tengerbe. És így tovább.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great.)
!5th on the Gospels.
Dearly beloved brethren, ye hear how that Peter and Andrew, having once heard~
the Lord call them, left their nets, and followed their Saviour. As yet they had~
seen none of His miracles, as yet they had received no promise of their~
exceeding and eternal reward; nevertheless, at one word of the Lord they forgot~
all those things which they seemed to have. We have seen many of His miracles;~
we have received many of His gracious chastenings; many times hath He warned us~
of the wrath to come and yet Christ calleth and we do not follow.

[Responsory7]
R. The holy Andrew lifted up his eyes to heaven, and prayed, and cried with a~
loud voice, and said Thou art my God, Whom I have seen; suffer not the unjust~
judge to take me down from the cross
* For now I know what the power of thy holy Cross is.
V. Thou art Christ my Master, Whom I have loved, Whom I have known, Whom I have~
confessed in this thing hear me.
R. For now I know what the power of thy holy Cross is.

[Lectio8]
He who calleth us to be converted is now enthroned in heaven; He hath broken the~
necks of the Gentiles to the yoke of the faith, He hath laid low the glory of~
the world, and the wrecks thereof, falling ever more and more to decay, do~
preach unto us that the coming of that day when He is to be revealed as our~
Judge is drawing nigh and yet, so stubborn is our mind, that we will not yet~
freely abandon that which, will we, nill we, we lose day by day. Dearly beloved~
brethren, what shall we answer at His judgmentseat, we whom no lessons can~
persuade, and no stripes can break of the love of this present world?

[Responsory8]
R. When Andrew saw the cross he cried, saying How wonderful art thou, O cross! O~
cross, how loveable art thou! O cross, thy bright beams enlighten the darkness~
of the whole world!
* Welcome a follower of Jesus, that, as by thee He died to redeem me, so by thee~
also He may take me unto Himself.
V. O precious cross, which the Members of my Lord have made so fair and goodly,
R. Welcome a follower of Jesus, that, as by thee He died to redeem me, so by~
thee also He may take me unto Himself.
&Gloria
R. Welcome a follower of Jesus, that, as by thee He died to redeem me, so by~
thee also He may take me unto Himself.

[Lectio9]
Come one perchance will ask in his heart, what Peter or Andrew had to lose by~
obeying the call of the Lord? Dearly beloved brethren, we must consider here~
rather the intention than the loss incurred by this obedience. He that keepeth~
nothing for himself, giveth up much; he that sacrificeth his all, sacrificed!~
what is to him a great deal. Beyond doubt, we cling to whatever we have, and~
what we have least, that we desire most. Peter and Andrew therefore gave up much~
when they gave up even the desire of possessing anything.
