An Angel stood at the Altar * of the Temple, having a golden censer in his hand. (Alleluja.)
While as the Archangel Michael fought against the dragon, * I heard voices saying Salvation unto our God. (Alleluja.)
Michael Mine Archangel, * I have appointed thee for a prince over the ingathering of souls. (Alleluja.)
O ye Angels of the Lord, bless ye the Lord always. (Alleluja.)

[Hymnus Vespera]
O Jesu Life, spring of the soul!
The Father's power and glory bright!
thee with the Angels we extol;
From thee they draw their life and light.
_
thy thousand thousand hosts are spread
Embattled o'er the azure sky;
But Michael bears thy standard dread,
And lifts the mighty Cross on high.
_
He in that Sign the rebel power.
Did with their Dragon Prince expel;
And hurled them from the heaven.' high towers,
Down like a thunderbolt to hell.
_
Grant us, with Michael, still, Lord,
Against the prince of pride to fight;
So may a crown be our reward,
Before the Lamb's pure throne of light.
_
To God the Father, with the Son
And Holy Paraclete, with thee,
As evermore hath been before,
Be glory through eternity.
Ámen.

Olvasmány Dániel próféta könyvéből
!Dan 7:9-11
9 Amint néztem, egyszer csak trónokat állítottak fel, és az Ősöreg leült. Ruhája fehér volt, mint a hó, fején a haj tiszta, mint a gyapjú. Trónja lobogó lángból volt, kerekei meg izzó parázsból.
10 Tűzfolyó eredt belőle és folyt tovább. Ezerszer ezren szolgáltak neki, és tízezerszer tízezren álltak előtte. Ítéletet tartottak, és felnyitották a könyveket.
11 Aztán láttam az elbizakodott beszédek elhangzása után, amelyeket a szarv hirdetett, magam láttam, hogy megölték a vadállatot, testét darabokra vágták és tűzre vetették.

[Responsory1]
R. There was silence in heaven while the dragon fought against Michael the Archangel.
* I heard the voice of thousands of thousands, saying Salvation, and honour, and power unto God the Almighty. (Alleluja.)
V. Thousands of thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times hundreds of thousands stood before Him.
R. I heard the voice of thousands of thousands, saying Salvation, and honour, and power unto God, the Almighty. (Alleluja.)

[Lectio2]
!Dan 10:4-8
4 Az első hónap huszonnegyedik napján a nagy folyam, vagyis a Tigris partján voltam.
5 Amikor körülnéztem, egyszerre egy gyolcsruhába öltözött férfit láttam. Derekát színarany övezte.
6 Teste ragyogott, mint a drágakő, arca, mint a villám, szeme, mint a lobogó tűz, karja és lába, mint a csiszolt érc felülete, szavának hangja meg, mint a tömeg zúgása.
7 De csak én, Dániel, láttam ezt a látomást. A férfiak, akik velem voltak, nem látták a látomást, mert akkora félelem fogta el őket, hogy elfutottak és elrejtőztek.
8 Ahogy így magamra maradtam, s előttem a nagy látomás: minden erőm elhagyott, arcom halálsápadt lett, s csaknem összeestem.

[Responsory2]
R. An Angel stood at the Altar of the temple, having a golden censer in his hand and there was given unto him much incense
* And the smoke of the incense ascended up before the Lord, out of the Angel's hand. (Alleluja.)
V. Before the Angels will I sing praise unto thee; I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy Name, O Lord.
R. And the smoke of the incense ascended up before the Lord, out of the Angel's hand. (Alleluja.)

[Lectio3]
!Dan 10:9-14
9 Amikor meghallottam a hangját, amint beszélt, szavának hallatára elájultam és elvágódtam arccal a föld felé.
10 Ekkor megérintett egy kéz, s térdemre és tenyeremre segített.
11 Majd azt mondta nekem: "Dániel, te kedvelt férfiú! Értsd meg a szavakat, amelyeket hozzád intézek! Állj fel, mert hozzád szól a küldetésem." Azután, hogy közölte velem ezeket a szavakat, remegve felálltam.
12 Ekkor így szólt hozzám: "Ne félj, Dániel! Mert az első naptól fogva, amikor elhatároztad, hogy az igazság ismeretére törekedve vezekelsz a te Istened színe előtt, könyörgésed meghallgatásra talált. Éppen a könyörgésed miatt kellett hozzád jönnöm.
13 A perzsák országának (angyal) fejedelme huszonegy napon át ellenállt nekem. De Mihály, az egyik legfőbb fejedelem, segítségemre jött. Ott is hagytam, hogy küzdjön meg a perzsák királyával,
14 magam pedig eljöttem, hogy tudtodra adjam: mi fog történni népeddel a végső napokban, mert a látomás azokról a napokról szól."

[Responsory3]
R. Before the Angels will I sing praise unto thee, and will worship toward thy holy temple
* And I will praise thy Name, O Lord. (Alleluja.)
V. For thy loving kindness, and for thy truth; for Thou hast glorified thine holy Name on us.
R. And I will praise thy Name, O Lord. (Alleluja.)
&Gloria
R. And I will praise thy Name, O Lord. (Alleluja.)

[Lectio4]
That the blessed Archangel Michael hath oftentimes been seen of men is attested on the authority of the Holy Bible, and also by the ancient traditions of the Saints. For this reason such visions are held in remembrance in many places. As of old time did the Synagogue of the Jews, so now doth the Church of God~
venerate Michael as her watcher and defender. But during the Popedom of Gelasius I. the summit of Mount Gargano in Apulia, at whose foot lieth the town of Siponto, was the scene of an extraordinary appearance of this same Archangel Michael.

[Responsory4]
R. This is Michael, who to battle leads the armies of the skies
* Whosoever on him calleth blessed within his wardship lies. His a prayer whose voice availing aids from earth toward heaven to rise. (Alleluja.)
V. The Archangel Michael is the Vice-Roy of Paradise, and the Angels that are the dwellers therein, do hold him in worship.
R. Whosoever on him calleth blessed within his wardship lies. His a prayer whose voice availing aids from earth toward heaven to rise. (Alleluja.)

[Lectio5]
And it came to pass on this wise. A certain man had a bull grazing with the flock upon Mount Gargano, and it strayed. And when they had sought it for a long while they found it jammed in the mouth of a cavern. Then one that stood there shot an arrow at it to slay it, but the arrow turned round and came back against him that had shot it. They therefore that saw it, and all those that heard it, were sore afraid because of that which had come to pass, so that no man dared any more to draw near to the cavern. But when they had sought counsel of the Bishop of Siponto, he answered, that it behoved to seek the interpretation from God, and proclaimed three days of fasting and prayer.

[Responsory5]
R. Where Angels lead the spirits of the blessed dead the glad procession moves with Michael at its head
* To lead them into the garden of Eden. (Alleluja.)
V. Lord, send thy Holy Spirit from heaven the Spirit of wisdom and understanding.
R. To lead them into the garden of Eden. (Alleluja.)

[Lectio6]
After three days the Archangel Michael gave warning to the Bishop that that place was under his protection, and that he had thus pointed out by a sign that he wished that worship should be offered to God there, with remembrance of himself and of the Angels. Then the Bishop and the citizens made haste and came to the cavern and when they found that the form thereof was somewhat after the fashion of a Church, they began to perform the public worship of God therein which sanctuary hath been glorified with many miracles. It was not long after these things that Pope~
Boniface IV. hallowed the Church of St Michael on Hadrian's Mole at Rome, on the 29th day of September, on the which day the Church also holdeth in remembrance All Angels. But this present day is hallowed in remembrance of the manifestation of the Archangel Michael.

[Responsory6]
R. At that time shall Michael stand up, which standeth for your children.
* And there shall be a time, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time. (Alleluja)
V. At that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the Book of Life.
R. And there shall be a time, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time. (Alleluja)
&Gloria
R. And there shall be a time, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time. (Alleluja)

Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 18:1-10
Azon időben odamentek Jézushoz a tanítványok és megkérdezték tőle: "Ki a legnagyobb a mennyek országában?" És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Hilary, Bishop of Poitiers.
!Com. on Matth. xviii.
Unless ye become as little children," saith the Lord, "ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven," that is, unless by the uprooting of bodily and mental depravity, we bring our souls to the innocency of childhood. But He giveth the name of children to all such as believe by the hearing of faith. Children follow their father, love their mother, know not how to wish evil to their neighbours, are not careful for earthly riches they insult not, they hate not, they lie~
not, they believe what they are told, and take for truth what they hear. Us then it behoveth to return to the simpleness of little children, for when we are well rooted therein, we shall so far bear about in ourselves an image of the sublime simpleness of the Lord Jesus.

[Responsory7]
R. Be not ye afraid before the Gentiles but in your hearts, worship ye the Lord, and fear Him
* For His Angel is with you. (Alleluja.)
V. An Angel stood at the Altar of the Temple, having a golden censer in his hand.
R. For His Angel is with you. (Alleluja.)

[Lectio8]
Vae unto the world because of offences The lowliness of the Passion is an offence unto the world. Such is the state of stupidity to which man's ignorance hath reduced itself, that it turneth away from the Lord of Eternal Glory, because of the unsightliness of the Cross And what is so certain to bring woe unto the world as to turn away from Christ And therefore He saith " It must needs be that offences come," because His fulfilling the lowliness of the Passion was the predestined mean whereby He was to give us eternal life.

[Responsory8]
R. The Archangel Michael came to help God's people.
* He arose to succour the spirits of the righteous. (Alleluja.)
V. An Angel stood at the Altar of the Temple, having a golden censer in his hand.
R. He arose to succour the spirits of the righteous. (Alleluja.)
&Gloria
R. He arose to succour the spirits of the righteous. (Alleluja.)

[Lectio9]
Make heed that ye despise not one of these little ones that believe in Me." He hath laid on us a most meet tie to constrain us to love one another, especially such as indeed believe in the Lord. " For I say unto you that in heaven their Angels do always behold the face of My Father Which is in heaven. For the Son of Man is come to save that which was lost." From these words we see, first, that the Son of Man saveth secondly, that the Angels do see God and thirdly, that the Angels of these little ones have the wardship over the prayers of the faithful. That the Angels have this wardship is taught us absolutely. The Angels therefore do every day offer to God the prayers which they which are saved do make to Him in the Name of Christ. Therefore it is dangerous for a man to despise them, seeing that these are they by whose watchful service and ministry, his wishes and requests are presented before the throne of the eternal and unseen God.
