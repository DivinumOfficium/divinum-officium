[Ant Vespera]
God hath given His Angels charge over thee, * to keep thee in all thy ways.
Let us praise the Lord, Whom the Angels do praise, unto Whom Cherubim and Seraphim do cry, Holy, Holy, Holy.
In heaven their Angels do always behold the face of My Father, * Which is in heaven.
Blessed be God, * Who sent His Angel, and delivered His servants that trusted in Him.
Praise ye God, * all His Angels Praise ye Him, all His hosts!

[Hymnus Vespera]
Angel guardians of men,
Spirits and powers we sing,
Whom our Father hath sent, aids to our weakly frame,
Heavenly friends and guides, help from on high to bring,
Lest we fail through the foeman's wile.
_
He, the spoiler of souls, Angel- traitor of old,
Cast in merited wrath out of his honored place,
Burns with envy and hate, seeking their souls to gain
Whom God's mercy invites to heaven.
_
Therefore come to our help, watchful ward of our lives:
Turn aside from the land God to thy care confides
Sickness and woe of soul, yea, and what else of ill
Peace of heart to its folk denies.
_
Now to the Holy Three praise evermore resound:
Under whose hand divine resteth the triple world
Governed in wondrous wise: glory be theirs and might
While the ages unending run.
Ámen.

Mózes második könyvébõl.
!Exod 23:20-23
20 Nézd, elõtted küldöm angyalomat, hogy õrizzen utaidon, és elvezessen arra a~
helyre, amelyet kijelöltem.
21 Tiszteld õt, hallgass szavára és ne lázadozz ellene. Engedetlenségedet nem~
bocsátaná meg, mivel az én nevem van benne.
22 De ha hallgatsz a szavára és megteszel mindent, amit parancsol, akkor~
ellensége leszek ellenségeidnek és szorongatni fogom azokat, akik téged~
szorongatnak.
23 Akkor angyalom elõtted fog járni, elvezet az amoritákhoz, a hetitákhoz, a~
perizitákhoz, a kánaániakhoz, a hivvitákhoz, a jebuzitákhoz, és én kiirtom õket.

[Responsory1]
R. God hath given His Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.

Zakariás Próféta könyvébol
!Zech 1:7-11
7 A tizenegyedik hónap [a Sebat hónap] huszonnegyedik napján, Dárius 2. évében~
az Úr szózatot intézett Zakariás prófétához, [Berekjának], Iddó [fiának a]~
fiához:
8 Az éj folyamán látomásom volt. Egy ember állt a mirtuszfák között a völgyben;~
mögötte sárga, vörössárga, fekete és fehér lovak voltak.
9 Megkérdeztem: "Mik ezek, Uram?" [Az angyal, aki hozzám beszélt, azt mondta:~
"Mindjárt megmutatom neked, hogy mik ezek."]
10 Az ember, aki a mirtuszfák között állt, ezt válaszolta: "Ezek azok, akiket az~
Úr küldött, hogy járják be a földet."
11 Ekkor a lovak azt mondták az Úr angyalának, aki a mirtuszfák között állt:~
"Bejártuk a földet. Az egész földön béke van és nyugalom."

[Responsory2]
R. Then the angel of the Lord answered, and said O Lord of hosts,
* How long wilt Thou not have mercy on Jerusalem, and on the cities of Judah,~
against which Thou hast had indignation
V. These three score and ten years?
R. How long wilt Thou not have mercy on Jerusalem, and on the cities of Judah,~
against which Thou hast had indignation?

!Zech 2:1-5
1 Azután fölemeltem tekintetem és látomást láttam. Volt ott négy szarv.
2 Megkérdeztem az angyalt, aki beszélt hozzám: "Mik ezek a szarvak, Uram?" Azt~
felelte: "Ezek azok a szarvak, amelyek szétszórták Júdát (Izraelt) és~
Jeruzsálemet."
3 Azután az Úr négy kovácsot mutatott nekem.
4 Megkérdeztem: "Mit fognak ezek itt csinálni?" Azt mondta: "[Ezek azok a~
szarvak ott, amelyek szétszórták Júdát, úgyhogy senki sem merte fölemelni a~
fejét.] S ezek most idejöttek, hogy legyõzzék õket, [hogy letörjék azoknak a~
nemzeteknek a szarvát, amelyek fölemelték a szarvukat Júda országa ellen és~
szétszórták]".
5 Azután fölemeltem tekintetem és látomást láttam. Egy embert, akinek mérõzsinór~
volt a kezében.

[Responsory3]
R. When ye see the Gentiles, be not afraid of them, but in your hearts worship~
and fear the Lord
* For His Angel is with you.
V. An Angel stood at the Altar of the Temple, having a golden censer in his~
hand.
R. For His Angel is with you.

[Lectio4]
From the Sermons of St Bernard, Abbat (of Clairvaux.)
!On Ps. xc
He hath given His Angels charge over thee. A wonderful graciousness, and a~
wonderful outpouring of love. For who hath given charge? And what charge? Unto~
whom? And over whom? Let us carefully consider, my brethren, let us carefully~
hold in mind this great charge. For who hath given this charge? To Whom belong~
the Angels? Whose commandments do they obey, and Whose will do they do? He hath~
given His Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways, and that not~
carelessly, for they shall bear thee up in their hands. The Highest Majesty,~
therefore, hath given charge unto Angels, even His Angels. Unto these beings so~
excellently exalted, so blessed, so near to Himself, even as His own household,~
unto these hath He given charge over thee. Who art thou? What is man, that Thou~
art mindful of him? or the son of man, that Thou visitest him? (Ps. viii. 5.)~
Even as though man were not rottenness, and the son of man, a worm. (Job. xxv.~
6.) But what charge hath He given them over thee? To keep thee in all thy ways.

[Responsory4]
R. As the Lord liveth
* His Angel hath kept me in my way that I went thither, and in my sojourning~
there, and in mine home - coming again hither.
V. And the Lord hath not suffered me that am His handmaid to be defiled.
R. His Angel hath kept me in my way that I went thither, and in my sojourning~
there, and in mine home-coming again hither.

[Lectio5]
That respect, what thankfulness, what trust, ought this word to work in thee!~
Respect for their presence, thankfulness for their kindness, trust in their safe~
keeping. Walk carefully, as one with whom are Angels, as hath been laid in~
charge upon them, in all thy ways. In every lodging, in every nook, have~
reverence for thine Angel. Dare not to do in his presence what thou wouldst not~
dare to do in mine. Or dost thou doubt whether he be indeed present, because~
thou seest him not? What if thou heardest him? What if thou touchedst him? What~
if thou smelledst him? Behold, not by sight alone is the presence of things made~
manifest.

[Responsory5]
R. The Angel of the Lord came down into the furnace together with Azariah and~
his fellows, and smote the flame of the fire out of the furnace
* $o that the fire touched them not at all, neither hurt them.
V. Blessed be their God, Who sent His Angel, and delivered His servants that~
trusted in Him!
R. So that the fire touched them not at all, neither hurt them.

[Lectio6]
Let us also, brethren, dearly love His Angels, as them with whom we are one day~
to be co-heirs, and who in the meanwhile are leaders and guardians set over us~
by the Father. With such guardians, whereof shall we be afraid? They that keep~
us in all our ways, can neither be conquered nor corrupted, far less can they~
corrupt. They are trusty, they are wary, they are mighty. Whereof shall we be~
afraid? Only let us follow them, only let us cleave unto them, and we shall~
abide under the shadow of the God of heaven. As often then as the gloom of~
temptation threateneth thee, or the sharpness of tribulation hangeth over thee,~
call upon Him That keepeth thee, thy Shepherd, thy Refuge in times of trouble,~
call upon Him, and say

[Responsory6]
R. In all their affliction He was not afflicted
* And the Angel of His presence saved them.
V. In His love and in His pity He redeemed them; and He bare them and carried~
them all the days of old.
R. And the Angel of His presence saved them.
&Gloria
R. And the Angel of His presence saved, them.

Evangélium szent Maté könyvébõl
!Matt 18:1-10
 Abban az idõben történt, hogy odamentek Jézushoz a tanítványok és megkérdezték~
tõle: "Ki a legnagyobb a mennyek országában?" És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Hilary, Bishop (of Poitiers.)
!Comm. on Matth. xviii.
Unless ye become as little children, saith the Lord, ye shall not enter into the~
kingdom of heaven, that is, unless by the uprooting of bodily and mental~
depravity, we bring our souls to the innocency of childhood. But He giveth the~
name of children to all such as believe by the hearing of faith. Children follow~
their father, love their mother, know not how to wish evil to their neighbours,~
are not careful for earthly riches; they insult not, they hate not, they lie not,~
they believe what they are told, and take for truth what they hear. Us then it~
behoveth to return to the simpleness of little children, for when we are well~
rooted therein, we shall so far bear about in ourselves an image of the sublime~
simpleness of the Lord Jesus.

[Responsory7]
R. When Maccabeus and they that were with him heard that (Lysias) besieged the~
holds, they and all the people with lamentation and tears besought the Lord that~
He would send
* A good Angel to deliver Israel.
V. So they went forth together with a willing mind, and, as they were at~
Jerusalem, there appeared before them on horseback one in white clothing.
R. A good Angel to deliver Israel.

[Lectio8]
Wee unto the world because of offences! The lowliness of the Passion is an~
offence unto the world. Such is the state of stupidity to which man's ignorance~
hath reduced itself, that it turneth away from the Lord of Eternal Glory,~
because of the unsightliness of the Cross! And what is so certain to bring woe~
unto the world as to turn away from Christ? And therefore He saith It must~
needs be that offences come, because his fulfilling the lowliness of the Passion~
was the predestined mean whereby He was to give us eternal life.

[Responsory8]
R. O Lord, Thou didst send thine Angel in the time of Hezekiah, King of Judah,~
and didst slay in the host of Sennacherib an hundred, fourscore, and five~
thousand.
* Wherefore now also, O Lord of heaven, send thy good Angel before us, for a~
fear and dread of the might of thine arm.
V. That those be stricken with terror that come with blasphemy against thy holy~
people.
R. Now also, O Lord of heaven, send thy good Angel before us, for a fear and~
dread of the might of thine arm.
&Gloria
R. Now also, O Lord of heaven, send thy good Angel before us, for a fear and~
dread of the might of thine arm.

[Lectio9]
Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones that believe in Me. He~
hath laid on us a most meet tie to constrain us to love one another, especially~
such as indeed believe in the Lord. For I say unto you that in heaven their~
Angels do always behold the face of My Father Which is in heaven. For the Son of~
Man is come to save that which was lost. From these words we see, first, that~
the Son of Man saveth; secondly, that the Angels do see God; and thirdly, that~
the Angels of these little ones have the wardship over the prayers of the~
faithful. That the Angels have this wardship is taught us absolutely. The Angels~
therefore do every day offer to God the prayers, which they which are saved, do~
make to Him in the Name of Christ. Therefore it is dangerous for a man to~
despise them, seeing that these are they by whose watchful service and ministry~
his wishes and requests are presented before the throne of the eternal and~
unseen God.

[Hymnus Laudes]
Ruler of the dread immense!
Maker of this mighty frame!
Whose eternal providence
Guides it, as from thee it came:
_
Low before thy throne we bend;
Hear our supplicating cries;
And thy light celestial send
With the freshly dawning skies.
_
King of kings, and Lord most High!
This of thy dear love we pray:
May thy Guardian Angel nigh,
Keep us from all sin this day.
_
May he crush the deadly wiles
Of the envious serpent's art,
Ever spreading cunning toils
Round about the thoughtless heart.
_
May he scatter ruthless war
Ere to this our land it come;
Plague and famine drive away,
Fix securely peace at home.
_
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
One eternal Trinity!
Guard by thy Angelic host
Us who put our trust in thee.
Ámen.
