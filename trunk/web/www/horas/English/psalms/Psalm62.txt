62:1 (A psalm of David while he was in the desert of Edom.)
62:2 O God, my God, to thee do I watch at break of day. For thee my soul hath thirsted; for thee my flesh, O how many ways!
62:3 In a desert land, and where there is no way, and no water: so in the sanctuary have I come before thee, to see thy power and thy glory.
62:4 For thy mercy is better than lives: thee my lips will praise.
62:5 Thus will I bless thee all my life long: and in thy name I will lift up my hands.
62:6 Let my soul be filled as with marrow and fatness: and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips.
62:7 If I have remembered thee upon my bed, I will meditate on thee in the morning:
62:8 Because thou hast been my helper. And I will rejoice under the covert of thy wings:
62:9 My soul hath stuck close to thee: thy right hand hath received me.
62:10 But they have sought my soul in vain, they shall go into the lower parts of the earth:
62:11 They shall be delivered into the hands of the sword, they shall be the portions of foxes.
62:12 But the king shall rejoice in God, all they shall be praised that swear by him: because the mouth is stopped of them that speak wicked things.
