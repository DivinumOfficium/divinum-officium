Lesson from the second book of Machabees
!2 Mac 3:23-25
23  But Heliodorus executed that which he had resolved on, himself being present in the same place with his guard about the treasury.
24  But the spirit of the almighty God gave a great evidence of his presence, so that all that had presumed to obey him, falling down by the power of God, were struck with fainting and dread.
25  For there appeared to them a horse with a terrible rider upon him, adorned with a very rich covering: and he ran fiercely and struck Heliodorus with his fore feet, and he that sat upon him seemed to have armour of gold.

!2 Mac 3:26-29
26  Moreover there appeared two other young men beautiful and strong, bright and glorious, and in comely apparel: who stood by him, on either side, and scourged him without ceasing with many stripes.
27  And Heliodorus suddenly fell to the ground, and they took him up covered with great darkness, and having put him into a litter they carried him out.
28  So he that came with many servants, and all his guard into the aforesaid treasury, was carried out, no one being able to help him, the manifest power of God being known.
29  And he indeed by the power of God lay speechless, and without all hope of recovery.

!2 Mac 3:32-24
32  So the high priest considering that the king might perhaps suspect that some mischief had been done to Heliodorus by the Jews, offered a sacrifice of health for the recovery of the man.
33 And when the high priest was praying, the same young men in the same clothing stood by Heliodorus, and said to him: Give thanks to Onias the priest: because for his sake the Lord hath granted thee life. 
34 And thou having been scourged by God, declare unto all men the great works and the power of God. And having spoken thus, they appeared no more.
