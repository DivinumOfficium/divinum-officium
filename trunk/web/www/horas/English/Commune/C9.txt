4 Hast thou eyes of flesh: or, shalt thou see as man seeth?
5 Are thy days as the days of man, and are thy years as the times of men:

24 Why hidest thou thy face, and thinkest me thy enemy?
25 Against a leaf, that is carried away with the wind, thou showest thy power, and thou pursuest a dry straw.
