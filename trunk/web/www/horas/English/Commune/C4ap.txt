From the Sermons of St Maximus, Bishop [of Turin.]
!Homilia 59, being the 2nd on St Eusebius of Vercelli.
It is idle to strive to add anything to the praise of our holy and most blessed~
Father N. whose Feast is this day kept. The beauty of his life oughtnot to be~
the subject of panegyrics, so much as the object of imitation. The Scripture~
saith " A wise son is the glory of his father," trulythen will he be honoured~
by such as, by doing after his en sample,show themselves to be his children for~~
in Christ Jesus hath he begotten us through the Gospel.(1 Cor. iv. 15.)

[Responsory4]
R. I have found David My servant, with My holy oil have I anointed him
* For My hand shall help him. Alleluia
V. The enemy shall prevail nothing against him, nor the son of wickedness afflict him.
R. For My hand shall help him. Alleluia

[Lectio5].
Whatsoever, therefore, of virtue and grace there may be in this holy people, all~
the bright streams thereof do flow from him, as from a most clear fountain. By~
his manly chastity, by his sternly noble temperance, by the graceful courtesy~
which marked him, he drew all men's love to God and by his eminent ministry in~
his Bishoprick he hath left behind him in his disciples, many heirs of his~
priesthood.

[Responsory5]
R. I have laid help upon one that is mighty, and have exalted one chosen out of My people
* For My hand shall help him. Alleluia
V. I have found David My servant, with My holy oil have I anointed him.
R. For My hand shall help him. Alleluia

[Lectio6]
It is very meet and right that upon this day, which is made a joyful day for us~
because it is the day whereon our blessed Father N., ~
passed away to heaven, I say it is very meet and right that on this day we~
should sing that verse of the Psalms "The righteous shall be in everlasting~
remembrance." (cxi. 7.) His memory is rightly honoured among men who is at this~
present making glad among Angels. The word of God saith "Judge none blessed~
before his death," (Ecclus. xi. 30,) as though it were said, "Judge him blessed~
when life is ended, praise him when he is made perfect." For there are two main~
reasons why it is better to praise a dead man than a living, since, if thou call~
him holy and worthy after his death, thou dost it when neither canst thou be~
corrupted by being a flatterer, nor he by being nattered.

[Responsory6]
R. This is he which wrought great wonders before God, and the whole earth is full of his teaching
* May he pray for all people, that their sins may be forgiven unto them Alleluia
V. This is he which loved not his life in this world, and hath attained unto the kingdom of heaven.
R. May he pray for all people, that their sins may be forgiven unto them Alleluia
&Gloria
R. May he pray for all people, that their sins may be forgiven unto them Alleluia

From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 5:13-19
At that time Jesus said unto His disciples Ye are the salt of the earth. But~
if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted And so on.
_
Homily by St Hilary, Bishop of Poitiers.
!Comment, on Matth. V
Ye are the salt of the earth. But if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith~
shall it be salted It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and~
to be trodden under foot of men. There is, I take it, no such thing as salt of~
the earth. How, then, can the Apostles be called the salt of the earth? But the~
true meaning of these words will be made plain, when we consider the duty of~
Apostles, and the nature of salt itself. Now, salt is a compound of the elements~
of water and fire, out of the which two things in salt there is made one.

[Responsory7]
R. The Lord loved him and beautified him He clothed him with a robe of glory
* And crowned him at the gates of Paradise. Alleluia
V. The Lord hath put on him the breast-plate of faith, and hath adorned him.
R. And crowned him at the gates of Paradise. Alleluia

[Lectio8]
This thing, therefore, thus made to serve in divers ways the use of men, doth~
keep from corruption bodies whereon it is sprinkled, and doth readily yield to~
all the senses the perception of its inborn savour. And thus are the Apostles,~
seeing that they are the preachers of the kingdom of heaven, and in a certain~
sense the sowers of the seed of life everlasting, since that Word of God which~
they scatter hath power to make this mortal put on immortality. Meetly then are~
they called salt, the savour of whose teaching doth keep sweet the receiver~
thereof even unto life everlasting.

[Responsory8]
R. In the midst of the congregation did the Lord open his mouth.
* And filled him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding. Alleluia
V. He made him rich with joy and gladness.
R. And filled him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding. Alleluia
&Gloria
R. And filled him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding. Alleluia

[Lectio9]
But the nature of salt is to be ever the same, and unchanging, and, on the other~
hand, the nature of man hath this weakness, to be changeable. He only is blessed~
who hath continued even unto the end in all the works which God hath commanded.~
Therefore dot! the Lord warn them whom He calleth the salt of the earth, that~
they are behoven to remain strong in that strength which He hath given unto them,~
lest, becoming themselves savourless, they should be impotent to season others~
losing the freshness of their own saltness, be unable to stop the corruption~
round about them and so the Church cast them out of her buttery, and they and~
those that they should have salted, be together trodden under foot of such as~
enter in.
