(Canticum Isaiae * Isa 33:2-10)
 33:2 O Lord, have mercy on us: for we have waited for thee: be thou our arm in the morning, and our salvation in the time of trouble.
33:3 At the voice of the angel the people fled, and at the lifting up thyself the nations are scattered.
33:4 And your spoils shall be gathered together as the locusts are gathered, as when the ditches are full of them.
33:5 The Lord is magnified, for he hath dwelt on high: he hath filled Sion with judgment and justice.
33:6 And there shall be faith in thy times: riches of salvation, wisdom and knowledge: the fear of the Lord is his treasure.
33:7 Behold they that see shall cry without, the angels of peace shall weep bitterly.
33:8 The ways are made desolate, no one passeth by the road, the covenant is made void, he hath rejected the cities, he hath not regarded the men.
33:9 The land hath mourned, and languished: Libanus is confounded and become foul, and Saron is become as a desert: and Basan and Carmel are shaken.
33:10 Now will I rise up, saith the Lord: now will I be exalted, now will I lift up myself.
