58:1 Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; * and defend me from them that rise up against me.
58:2 Deliver me from them that work iniquity, * and save me from bloody men.
58:3 For behold they have caught my soul: * the mighty have rushed in upon me:
58:4 Neither is it my iniquity, nor my sin, O Lord: * without iniquity have I run, and directed my steps.
58:5 Rise up thou to meet me, and behold: * even thou, O Lord, the God of hosts, the God of Israel.
58:6 Attend to visit all the nations: * have no mercy on all them that work iniquity.
58:7 They shall return at evening, and shall suffer hunger like dogs: * and shall go round about the city.
58:8 Behold they shall speak with their mouth, and a sword is in their lips: * for who, say they, hath heard us?
58:9 But thou, O Lord, shalt laugh at them: * thou shalt bring all the nations to nothing.
58:10 I will keep my strength to thee: for thou art my protector: * my God, his mercy shall prevent me.
58:12 God shall let me see over my enemies: slay them not, * lest at any time my people forget. 
58:13 And scatter them by thy power; * and bring them down, O Lord, my protector:
58:14 For the sin of their mouth, and the word of their lips: * and let them be taken in their pride.
58:15 And for their cursing and lying they shall be talked of, when they are consumed: * when they are consumed by thy wrath, and they shall be no more.
58:16 And they shall know that God will rule Jacob, * and all the ends of the earth.
58:17 They shall return at evening and shall suffer hunger like dogs: * and shall go round about the city.
58:18 They shall be scattered abroad to eat, * and shall murmur if they be not filled.
58:19 But I will sing thy strength: * and will extol thy mercy in the morning.
58:20 For thou art become my support, * and my refuge, in the day of my trouble.
58:21 Unto thee, O my helper, will I sing, for thou art God my defence: * my God my mercy.
