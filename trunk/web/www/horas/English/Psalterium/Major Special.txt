Lightsome and blushing, dawn of day returneth;
Fervent in spirit, to the world’s Creator
Pray we devoutly:

Banish all troubles, kindly health bestowing;

v. Maker of all, eternal King, 
Who day and night about dost bring:
Who weary mortals to relieve, 
Dost in their times the seasons give:
_
Now the shrill cock proclaims the day,
And calls the sun’s awak’ning ray 
The wand’ring pilgrim’s guiding light,
That marks the watches night by night.
_
Roused at the note, the morning star
Heaven’s dusky veil uplifts afar:
Night’s vagrant bands no longer roam,
But from their dark ways hie them home.
_
The encouraged sailor’s fears are o’er,
The foaming billows rage no more:
Lo! e’en the very Church’s rock 
Melts at the crowing of the cock.
_
O let us then like men arise; 
The cock rebukes our slumbering eyes,
Bestirs who still in sleep would lie,
And shames who would their Lord deny.
_
New hope his clarion-note awakes, 
Sickness the feeble frame forsakes, 
The robber sheathes his lawless sword,
Faith to the fallen is restored.
_
Look on us, Jesu, when we fall, 
And with thy look our souls recall:
If thou but look, our sins are gone,
And with due tears our pardon won.
_
Shed through our hearts thy piercing ray,
Our souls’ dull slumber drive away:
Thy name be first on every tongue,
To thee our earliest praises sung.
_
All laud to God the Father be,
All praise, Eternal Son, to thee,
All glory, as is ever meet,
To God the holy Paraclete
Amen.

v. O blest Creator of the light, 
Who mak’st the day with radiance bright,
And o’er the forming world didst call
The light from chaos first of all;
_
Whose wisdom joined in meet array
The morn and eve, and named them day:
Night comes with all its darkling fears;
Regard thy people’s prayers and tears.
_
Lest, sunk in sin, and whelmed with strife,
They lose the gift of endless life; 
While thinking but the thoughts of time,
They weave new chains of woe and crime.
_
But grant them grace that they may strain
The heavenly gate and prize to gain:
Each harmful lure aside to cast, 
And purge away each error past.
_
O Father, that we ask be done, 
Through Jesus Christ, thine only Son;
Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,
Doth live and reign eternally.

O thou true sun, on us thy glance 
Let fall in royal radiance, 
The Spirit’s sanctifying beam 
Upon our earthly senses stream.
_
The Father too our prayers implore,
Father of glory evermore, 
The Father of all grace and might, 
To banish sin from our delight:
_
To guide whate’er we nobly do,
With love all envy to subdue,
To make ill-fortune turn to fair,
And give us grace our wrongs to bear.
_
Our mind be in his keeping placed,
Our body true to him and chaste, 
Where only faith her fire shall feed,
And burn the tares of Satan’s seed.
_
And Christ to us for food shall be, 
From him our drink that welleth free,
The Spirit’s wine, that maketh whole,
And mocking not, exalts the soul.
_
Rejoicing may this day go hence,
Like virgin dawn our innocence,
Like fiery noon our faith appear,
Nor know the gloom of twilight drear.
_
Morn in her rosy car is borne; 
Let him come forth our perfect morn,
The Word in God the Father One, 
The Father perfect in the Son.

All glory, as is ever meet,

v. O great Creator of the sky, 
Who wouldest not the floods on high
With earthly waters to confound, 
But mad’st the firmament their bound;
_
The floods above thou didst ordain;
The floods below thou didst restrain:
That moisture might attemper heat,
Lest the parched earth should ruin meet.
_
Upon our souls, good Lord, bestow
Thy gift of grace in endless flow:
Lest some renewed deceit or wile
Of former sin should us beguile.
_
Let faith discover heav’nly light;
So shall its rays direct us right:
And let this faith each error chase,
And never give to falsehood place.
_
Grant this, O Father, ever One 
With Christ, thy sole-begotten Son,
And Holy Ghost, whom all adore, 
Reigning and blest forevermore.

_
Who, wounded with a direful spear,
Did, purposely to wash us clear
From stain of sin, pour out a flood
Of precious water mixed with blood.
_
That which the prophet-king of old
Hath in mysterious verse foretold, 
Is now accomplished, whilst we see
God ruling nations from a tree.
_
O lovely and refulgent tree, 
Adorned with purpled majesty; 
Culled from a worthy stock, to bear
Those limbs which sanctifièd were.
_
Blest tree, whose happy branches bore
The wealth that did the world restore;
The beam that did that body weigh
Which raised up hell’s expected prey.
_
!The following verse is said on bended knee.
_
Hail, cross, of hopes the most sublime!
Now in this mournful passion time,
Improve religious souls in grace, 
The sins of criminals efface.
_
Blest Trinity, salvation’s spring, 
May every soul thy praises sing; 
To those thou grantest conquest by
The holy cross, rewards apply.
Amen.

!Rom 6:9-10
v. Knowing that Christ rising again from the dead, dieth now no more, death shall no more have dominion over him. For in that he died to sin, he died once; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.
$Deo gratias

[Hymnus Pasch Laudes]
v. The morn had spread her crimson rays,
When rang the skies with shouts of praise;
Earth joined the joyful hymn to swell,
That brought despair to vanquished hell.
_
He comes victorious from the grave,
The Lord omnipotent to save, 
And brings with him to light of day
The saints who long imprisoned lay.
_
Vain is the cavern’s three-fold ward — 
The stone, the seal, the armed guard;
O death, no more thine arm we fear,
The Victor’s tomb is now thy bier.
_
Let hymns of joy to grief succeed, 
We know that Christ is risen indeed;
We hear his white-robed angel’s voice,
And in our risen Lord rejoice.
_
With Christ we died, with Christ we rose,
When at the font his name we chose;
Oh, let not sin our robes defile, 
And turn to grief the paschal smile.
_
* To God the Father let us sing,
To God the Son, our risen King,
And equally let us adore
The Spirit, God forevermore.
Amen.

v. At the Lamb’s high feast we sing
Praise to our victorious King,
Who hath washed us in the tide
Flowing from his piercèd side.
_
Praise we him whose love divine
Gives the guests his blood for wine,
Gives his body for the feast, 
Love the victim, love the priest.
_
Where the paschal blood is poured,
Death’s dark angel sheathes his sword;
Israel’s hosts triumphant go 
Through the wave that drowns the foe.
_
Christ, the Lamb whose blood was shed,
Paschal victim, paschal bread;
With sincerity and love
Eat we manna from above.
_
Mighty victim from the sky,
Powers of hell beneath thee lie;
Death is conquered in the fight;
Thou hast brought us life and light.
_
Now thy banner thou dost wave;
Vanquished Satan and the grave;
Angels join his praise to tell —
See o’erthrown the prince of hell.
_
Paschal triumph, paschal joy,
Only sin can this destroy;
From the death of sin set free,
Souls re-born, dear Lord, in Thee.
_
* Hymns of glory, songs of praise,
Father, unto thee we raise;
Risen Lord, all praise to thee,
Ever with the Spirit be.

!Psalm 69
!(Unto the end, a psalm for David, to bring to remembrance that the Lord saved him.)
O God, come to my assistance; O Lord, make haste to help me. 
Let them be confounded and ashamed that seek my soul: 
Let them be turned backward, and blush for shame that desire evils to me: Let them be presently turned away blushing for shame that say to me: Tis well, tis well. 
Let all that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee; and let such as love thy salvation say always: The Lord be magnified.
But I am needy and poor; O God, help me. Thou art my helper and my deliverer: O Lord, make no delay. 
&Gloria

!Prayer
$Oremus.
v. O God, it is according to thy nature always to show mercy and forgiveness.
Receive our petition that we and all thy servants, bound by the chains of sin, may, by thy tender mercy, be pardoned.
v. We beg thee, O Lord, hear our prayers as we kneel before thee. Pardon our sins, as we confess them to thee, so that thou mayest, in thy kindness, give us pardon as well as peace.
v. In thy kindness show us, O Lord, thy unutterable mercy, and at one and the same time free us from all our sins, and snatch us away from the punishment which we deserve for them.
v. O God, thou art offended by sin, and placated by penance. Look with favor upon the prayers of thy people kneeling before thee. Turn away the scourges of thine anger which we have deserved for our sins.
v. Almighty, everlasting God, have mercy on thy servant N., our Sovereign Pontiff. Direct him, according to thy mercy into the path of eternal salvation so that, by thy grace, he may both desire those things that are pleasing to thee, and may perform them with all his strength.
v. O God, from whom all holy desires, all good counsels, and all just works do proceed; Give unto thy servants that peace which the world cannot give, so that, with our hearts set to obey thy commandments, and freed from the fear of the enemy, we may pass our lives in peace under thy protection.
v. Inflame our hearts and our desires, O Lord, with the fire of the Holy Spirit, so that we may serve thee with a chaste body, and please thee with a pure heart.
v. O God, thou art the creator and redeemer of all the faithful. Grant to the souls of thy servants departed the remission of all their sins, so that by our faithful prayers they may obtain the pardon they have always desired.
v. We beg thee, O Lord, to direct our actions by thy holy inspiration, and carry them forward by thy gracious assistance, so that every prayer and work of ours may always begin with thee, and, begun through thee, be happily ended.
v. Almighty and everlasting God, who hast dominion over the living and the dead and who art merciful to all whom thou foreknowest shall be thine by faith and good works, we humbly beg of thee, that they for whom we have intended to pour out our prayers, whether this present world still detains them in the flesh, or whether the world to come has already received them out of their bodies, may, through the prayers of all thy saints, by thy merciful goodness obtain the remission of all their sins
$Per Dominum
