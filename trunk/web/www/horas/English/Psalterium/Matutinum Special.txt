[Day0 Hymnus]
v. Now, from the slumbers of the night arising, 
Chant we the holy psalmody of David,
Hymns to our Master, with a voice concordant,
Sweetly intoning.
_
So may our Monarch pitifully hear us,
That we may merit with his saints to enter
Mansions eternal, therewithal possessing
Joy beatific.
_
This be our portion, God forever blessed,
Father eternal, Son, and Holy Spirit,
Whose is the glory, which through all creation
Ever resoundeth.
Amen.

[Day0 Hymnus1]
Hail day! whereon the One in Three
First formed the earth by sure decree,
The day its Maker rose again, 
And vanquished death, and burst our chain.
_
Away with sleep and slothful ease 
We raise our hearts and bend our knees,
And early seek the Lord of all, 
Obedient to the Prophet's call.
_
That He may hearken to our prayer,
Stretch forth His strong right arm to spare,
And ev'ry past offense forgiven, 
Restore us to our home in heaven.
_
Assembled here this holy day,
This holiest hour we raise the lay,
And O that He to whom we sing,
May now reward our offering!
_
O Father of unclouded light! 
Keep us this day as in thy sight, 
In word and deed that we may be 
From ev'ry touch of evil free.
_
That this our body's mortal frame 
May know no sin, and fear no shame,
Nor fire hereafter be the end 
Of passions which our bosom rend.
_
Redeemer of the world, we pray 
That thou wouldst wash our sins away,
And give us, of Thy boundless grace,
The blessings of the heavenly place.
_
Most Holy Father, hear our cry, 
Through Jesus Christ our Lord most High
Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee
Shall live and reign eternally.
Amen.


[Day1 Hymnus]
v. Our limbs refreshed with slumber now, 
And sloth cast off, in prayer we bow;
And while we sing thy praises dear,
O Father, be thou present here.
_
To thee our earliest morning song,
To thee our hearts full powers belong;
And thou, O Holy One, prevent 
Each following action and intent.
_
As shades at morning flee away,
And night before the star of day;
So each transgression of the night
Be purged by thee, celestial Light!
_
Cut off, we pray thee, each offense,
And every lust of thought and sense:
That by their lips who thee adore 
Thou mayst be praised forevermore.
_
Grant this, O Father ever One
With Christ, thy sole-begotten Son,
And Holy Ghost, whom all adore,
Reigning and blest forevermore.
Amen.

[Day2 Hymnus]
v. O Light of Light, O Day-spring bright,
Co-equal in thy Father’s light:
Assist us, as with prayer and psalm
Thy servants break the twilight calm.
_
All darkness from our minds dispel,
And turn to flight the hosts of hell:
Bid sleepfulness our eyelids fly, 
Lest overwhelmed in sloth we lie.
_
Jesu, thy pardon, kind and free,
Bestow on us who trust in thee:
And as thy praises we declare,
O with acceptance hear our prayer.
_
O Father, that we ask be done,
Through Jesus Christ, thine only Son;
Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,
Doth live and reign eternally.
Amen.

[Day3 Hymnus]
v. Who madest all and dost control,
Lord, with thy touch divine, 
Cast out the slumbers of the soul, 
The rest that is not thine.
_
Look down, Eternal Holiness,
And wash the sins away,
Of those, who, rising to confess,
Outstrip the lingering day.
_
Our hearts and hands by night, O Lord,
We lift them in Our need; 
As holy Psalmists give the word, 
And holy Paul the deed.
_
Each sin to thee of years gone by, 
Each hidden stain lies bare; 
We shrink not from thine awful eye,
But pray that thou wouldst spare.
_
Grant this, O Father, Only Son 
And Spirit, God of grace, 
To whom all worship shall be done
In every time and place,
Amen.

[Day4 Hymnus]
v. The dusky veil of night hath laid
The varied hues of earth in shade;
Before Thee, righteous Judge of all,
We contrite in confession fall.
_
Take far away our load of sin,
Our soiled minds make clean within:
Thy sov’reign grace, O Christ, impart,
From all offence to guard our heart.
_
For lo! our mind is dull and cold, 
Envenomed by sin’s baneful hold:
Fain would it now the darkness flee,
And seek, Redeemer, unto Thee.
_
Far from it drive the shades of night,
Its inmost darkness put to flight;
Till in the daylight of the blest
It joys to find itself at rest.
_
Almighty Father, hear our cry,
Through Jesus Christ, our Lord most High,
Who, with the Holy Ghost and Thee,
Doth live and reign eternally.
Amen.

[Day5 Hymnus]
v. O Three in One, and One in Three,
Who rulest all things mightily:
Bow down to hear the songs of praise
Which, freed from bonds of sleep, we raise.
_
While lingers yet the peace of night,
We rouse us from our slumbers light:
That might of instant prayer may win
The healing balm for wounds of sin.
_
If, by the wiles of Satan caught, 
This night-time we have sinned in aught,
That sin Thy glorious power to-day,
From heaven descending, cleanse away.
_
Let naught impure our bodies stain,
No laggard sloth our souls detain, 
No taint of sin our spirits know, 
To chill the fervor of their glow.
_
Wherefore, Redeemer grant that we
Fulfilled with thine own light may be:
That, in our course, from day to day,
By no misdeed we fall away.
_
Grant this, O Father ever One
With Christ, thy sole-begotten Son,
And Holy Ghost, whom all adore, 
Reigning and blest forevermore.
Amen.

[Day6 Hymnus]
v. Great God of boundless mercy hear;
Thou Ruler of this earthly sphere;
In substance one, in persons three,
Dread Trinity in Unity!
_
Do thou in love accept our lays
Of mingled penitence and praise;
And set our hearts from error free,
More fully to rejoice in thee.
_
Our reins and hearts in pity heal, 
And with thy chastening fires anneal;
Gird Thou our loins, each passion quell,
And every harmful lust expel.
_
Now as our anthems, upward borne,
Awake the silence of the morn, 
Enrich us with thy gifts of grace, 
From heaven, thy blissful dwelling-place!
_
Hear thou our prayer, Almighty King!
Hear thou our praises, while we sing,
Adoring with the heavenly host, 
The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!
Amen.

[Hymnus Adv]
v. Celestial Word, to this our earth
Sent down from God's eternal clime,
To save mankind by mortal birth 
Into a world of change and time;
_
Enlighten our hearts; vain hopes destroy;
And in thy love's consuming fire 
Fill all the soul with heavenly joy, 
And melt the dross of low desire.
_
So when the Judge of quick and dead
Shall bid his awful summons come,
To whelm the guilty soul with dread,
And call the blessed to their home.
_
Saved from the whirling, black abyss,
Forevermore to us be given 
To share the feast of saintly bliss, 
And see the face of God in heaven.
_
To God the Father and the Son 
Our songs with one accord we raise;
And to the Holy Spirit, One 
With them, be ever equal praise
Amen.

[Hymnus Quad]
v. The fast, as taught by holy lore, 
We keep in solemn course once more:
The fast to all men known, and bound
In forty days of yearly round.
_
The law and seers that were of old
In divers ways this Lent foretold, 
Which Christ, all seasons’ King and Guide,
In after ages sanctified.
_
More sparing therefore let us make
The words we speak, the food we take,
Our sleep and mirth, —and closer barred
Be every sense in holy guard.
_
Avoid the evil thoughts that roll
Like waters o’er the heedless soul;
Nor let the foe occasion find
Our souls in slavery to bind.
_
In prayer together let us fall,
And cry for mercy, one and all,
And weep before the Judge’s feet,
And his avenging wrath entreat.
_
Thy grace have we offended sore,
By sins, O God, which we deplore;
But pour upon us from on high,
O pardoning One, thy clemency.
_
Remember thou, though frail we be,
That yet thine handiwork are we;
Nor let the honour of thy name
Be by another put to shame.
_
Forgive the sin that we have wrought;
Increase the good that we have sought:
That we at length, our wanderings o'er,
May please thee here and evermore.
_
Grant O thou Blessed Trinity,
Grant, O Essential Unity,
That this our fast of forty days
May work our profit and thy praise.
Amen.

[Hymnus Quad5]
v. Sing, my tongue, the glorious battle
Sing the last, the dread affray;
O'er the cross, the victor's trophy,
Sound the high triumphal lay:
Tell how Christ, the world's Redeemer,
As a victim won the day.
_
God, his Maker, sorely grieving
That the first-made Adam fell,
When he ate the fruit of sorrow,
Whose reward was death and hell,
Noted then this wood, the ruin
Of the ancient wood to quell.
_
For the work of our salvation
Needs would have his order so,
And the multiform deceiver's
Art by art would overthrow,
And from thence would bring the med'cine
Whence the insult of the foe.
_
Wherefore, when the sacred fullness
Of the appointed time was come, 
This world's Maker left his Father,
Sent the heav'nly mansion from, 
And proceeded, God Incarnate, 
Of the Virgin's holy womb.
_
Weeps the infant in the manger
That in Bethlehem's stable stands;
And his limbs the Virgin Mother
Doth compose in swaddling bands,
Meetly thus in linen folding
Of her God the feet and hands.
_
To the Trinity be glory
Everlasting, as is meet;
Equal to the Father, equal
To the Son, and Paraclete:
Trinal Unity, whose praises
All created things repeat.
Amen.

[Hymnus Pasch]
v. O thou, the heavens' eternal King,
Creator, unto thee we sing,
With God the Father ever One,
Co-equal, co-eternal Son.
_
Thy hand, when first the world began,
Made in thine own pure image man,
And linked to Adam, sprung from earth,
A living soul of heavenly birth.
_
And when by craft the envious foe
Had marred thy noblest work below,
Clothed in our flesh, thou didst restore
The image thou hadst made before.
_
Once wast thou born of Mary's womb;
And now, new-born from out the tomb,
O Christ, thou bidd'st us rise with thee
From death to immortality.
_
Eternal Shepherd, thou dost lave
Thy flock in pure baptismal wave,
That mystic bath, that grave of sin,
Where ransomed souls new life begin.
_
Redeemer, thou for us didst deign
To hang upon the Cross of pain,
And give for us the lavish price
Of thine own blood in sacrifice.
_
Grant, Lord, in thee each faithful mind
Unceasing paschal joy may find;
And from the death of sin set free
Souls newly born to life by thee.
_
To thee, once dead, who now dost live,
All glory, Lord, thy people give,
Whom, with the Father, we adore,
And Holy Ghost forevermore.
Amen.
