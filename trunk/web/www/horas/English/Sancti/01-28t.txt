[Ant 1]
The blessed Agnes stood in the midst of the fire * and stretched forth her hands~
unto the Lord, and prayed, saying O Thou Who Alone art Almighty! Who Alone art~
to be adored! Who Alone art to be worshipped! Who Alone art to be feared! I~
bless thee, and glorify thy Name for ever and ever!

[Oratio]
O God, Who year by year dost gladden thy people by the solemn feast of thy~
blessed Virgin and Martyr Agnes, grant unto us, we beseech thee, not only~
devoutly to observe the same, but also to follow after the pattern of her godly~
conversation.

!Commemoratio for St Agnes.
The night when the parents of the blessed Agnes were watching at her grave, she~
appeared to them in company with a band of virgins, and said to them Father~
and Mother, weep not for me as though I were dead; for now these virgins and I~
live together in Him Whose love was my whole life upon earth. Some years~
afterwards, Constance, the daughter of the Emperor Constantine, being sick of an~
incurable ulcer, betook herself to the said grave, although she was not yet a~
Christian, and as she lay by it and slept, she seemed to hear the voice of Agnes,~
saying to her Constance, be of good courage believe in Jesus Christ the Son~
of God, and He will make thee whole. The Princess, being healed, was baptized,~
along with many others of the Emperor's family and household, and afterwards~
built over the grave of the blessed Agnes a Church named in her honour.

[Ant 2]
Behold, now I see that * which I have desired; now I possess that for which I have hoped now am I united in heaven to Him Whom I loved with my whole heart upon earth.
