De Canticis canticorum.
!Song 2:1-7
1 I am the flower of the field, and the lily of the valleys.
2 As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.
3 As the apple tree among the trees of the woods, so is my beloved among the~
sons. I sat down under his shadow, whom I desired: and his fruit was sweet to my~
palate.
4 He brought me into the cellar of wine, he set in order charity in me.
5 Stay me up with flowers, compass me about with apples: because I languish with~
love.
6 His left hand is under my head, and his right hand shall embrace me.
7 I adjure you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and the harts of the,~
fields, that you stir not up, nor make the beloved to awake, till she please

[Responsory1]
R. Rise up, make haste, my love my fair one and come away; For, lo, the~
winter is past, the rain is over and gone.

R. The voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land.

[Lectio2]
!Song 2:8-13
8 The voice of my beloved, behold he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping~
over the hills.
9 My beloved is like a roe, or a young hart. Behold he standeth behind our wall,~
looking through the windows, looking through the lattices.
10 Behold my beloved speaketh to me: Arise, make haste, my love, my dove, my~
beautiful one, and come.
11 For winter is now past, the rain is over and gone.
12 The flowers have appeared in our land, the time of pruning is come: the voice~
of the turtle is heard in our land:
13 The fig tree hath put forth her green figs: the vines in flower yield their~
sweet smell.

[Responsory2]
R. Who is this that cometh up like the sun This, comely as Jerusalem
* The daughters of Zion saw her, and called her blessed the queens also, and~
they praised her.

lilies of the valleys.
R. The daughters of Zion saw her, and called her blessed the queens also, and~
they praised her.

[Lectio3]
!Song 2:13-17

14 My dove in the clefts of the rock, in the hollow places of the wall, show me~
thy face, let thy voice sound in my ears: for thy voice is sweet, and thy face~
comely.
15 Catch us the little foxes that destroy the vines: for our vineyard hath~
flourished.
16 My beloved to me, and I to him who feedeth among the lilies,
17 Till the day break, and the shadows retire. Return: be like, my beloved, to a~
roe, or to a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.

[Responsory3]

voice, and said: Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the Fruit of thy~

babe leaped in my womb for joy.
R. And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?

[Lectio4]
From the Sermons of St John Chrysostom, Patriarch of Constantinople.
!In Metaphrast. July.
As soon as our Redeemer was come among us, He went with haste, while as yet He~
was in His mother's womb, to visit His friend John. And John, in the one womb,~
becoming conscious of the Presence of Jesus in the other womb, dashed himself~
impatiently against the narrow walls of his natural prison, as though crying out I~
see the very Lord who hath given nature her bounds, and I wait not for the due~
season of my birth. There is no need for me to linger here till nine months are~
ended, for He That is Eternal is with me I will break out of my dark cell I will~
proclaim my full knowledge of many wonders. I am the sign. I will show that the~
Christ is here. I am the trumpet let me peal forth the news that the Son of God~
is come in the flesh. Let me give my trumpetnote, let me bless my father's~
tongue, and make it to speak again. Let me give my trumpet-note, let me quicken~
my mother's womb.

[Responsory4]
R. Behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills
* My beloved is like a gazelle or a young roe-buck!
V. He rejoiceth as a giant to run his course, his going-forth is from the end of~
the heavens.
R. My beloved is like a gazelle or a young roe-buck!

[Lectio5]
Thou seest, O beloved, how new and how strange a mystery is here John is not~
born, but by leaping he speaketh he is yet unseen, and he giveth warning he~
is not yet able to cry, but by his acts he is heard he draweth not yet the~
breath of life, but he preacheth God he seeth not yet the light, but he maketh~
known the Sun he is not come out of the womb, but he hasteth to play the~
Fore-runner in the Presence of the Lord he cannot restrain himself he~
rebelleth against the bounds set by nature, and struggleth to break out of the~
prison of the belly his longing is to herald the coming Saviour. He saith, as~
it were Behold, the Deliverer cometh and am I to remain still bound to abide~
here The Word cometh, that He may set right all things and am I still to tarry~
in prison I will go forth. I will run before Him, and cry aloud to all men, 'Behold the Lamb of God Which taketh away the sin of the world.'

[Responsory5]
R. Rejoice with me, rejoice with me, all ye that love the Lord, for, while I was~
yet a little one, I pleased the Most High,
* And I have brought forth from my bowels God and man.
V. All generations shall call me blessed, for God hath regarded the low estate~
of His hand-maiden.
R. And I have brought forth from my bowels God and man.

[Lectio6]
But do thou tell us, O John, how it came to pass that while thou wast still in~
the darkness of thy mother's womb, thou didst see and hear How didst thou~
behold the things of God How didst thou leap and bound for joy? Great, saith~
John, is the mystery of that which taketh place here, far from the understanding~
of men are these doings. It is meet that I should do a new thing in nature for~
the sake of Him Who is making new things which are beyond nature. I see in the~
womb, because I see the Sun of righteousness in a womb. I hear, because I am~
coming as the herald of the Great Word. I cry out, because I espy the~
Only-begotten Son of the Father clad in Flesh. I bound for joy, because I see~
that He by Whom all things were made, hath taken upon Him the form of a servant. I~
leap, because I think of the Redeemer of the world being made Flesh. I run~
before His coming, and herald His approach unto you with this, as it were, my~
confession.

[Responsory6]
R. Blessed art thou that hast believed, for there shall be a performance of~
those things which were told thee from the Lord. And Mary said
* My soul doth magnify the Lord.
V. Come, hear, and I will declare what God hath done for my soul.
R. My soul doth magnify the Lord.
&Gloria
R. My soul doth magnify the Lord.

From the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 1:39-47
And Mary arose in those days and went into the hill-country with haste, into a city of Judah. And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elizabeth. And so on.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop of Milan.
!Bk. ii. Comm. on Luke i.
We must here consider that the greater cometh unto the lesser, Mary unto~
Elizabeth, Christ unto John. And again afterwards, to hallow the baptism of John,~
the Lord came unto him to be baptized. It was soon that the blessings of the~
coming of Mary and of the Presence of God were made manifest. Have regard here~
to the distinction made, and to the special weight of every word. Elizabeth was~
the first to hear the voice of Mary's salutation, but John was the first to~
receive grace. She heard naturally, but he leaped mystically. She hailed the~
coming of Mary, he that of the Lord, Mary and Elizabeth spake words full of~
grace, but Jesus and John worked, and commenced their mystery of godliness from~
their mothers' beginnings, and so by twin miracles the mothers prophesied from~
the spirit of their unborn offspring. The babe leaped, and the mother was filled~
with the Holy Ghost. The mother was not filled before the son, but when the son~
was filled with the Holy Ghost, he filled his mother also.

[Responsory7]
R. All generations shall call me blessed,
* For the Lord, That is mighty, hath done to me great things, and holy is His~
Name.
V. And His mercy is on them that fear Him, from generation to generation.
R. For the Lord, That is mighty, hath done to me great things, and holy is His~
Name.

[Lectio8]
And whence is this to me, that the Mother of my Lord should come to me? That is~
to say, How cometh it to pass that so great a good should befall me, as that the~
Mother of my Lord should come to me I feel the miracle, I acknowledge the~
mystery the Mother of my Lord, pregnant with the Word, is full of God. And~
Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house. It is~
meet to record how Mary showed this kindness, and abode this mystic number of~
months.

[Responsory8]
R. O Holy Virgin Mary, happy indeed art thou, and right worthy of all praise,
* For out of thee rose the Sun of righteousness, * Even Christ our God.
V. Pray for the people, plead for the clergy, make intercession for all women~
vowed to God may all that make remembrance of thine holy Visitation feel the~
might of thine assistance.
R. For out of thee rose the Sun of righteousness.
&Gloria
R. Even Christ our God.

[Lectio9]
She tarried long, not only for friendship's sake, but also for the~
good of the Great Prophet. For if the first coming of Mary so blessed him, that~
even as a babe in the womb he leapt for joy, and his mother was filled with the~
Holy Ghost, what blessedness must we not deem to have flowed upon him from so~
long neighbourhood of Mary. Thus was the Prophet anointed, and trained by~
exercise like a strong wrestler, in his mother's womb, for his sinews were being~
braced for a hard battle.

[Lectio93]
!Commemoration for the Holy Martyrs Processus and Martinian.
At what time Peter and Paul were kept in the Mamertine Prison, at the foot of~
the Tarpeian Rock, two of the gaolers, named Processus and Martinian, along with~
other forty, were moved by the preaching and miracles of the Apostles to believe~
in Christ, and were baptized in a spring which suddenly brake forth out of the~
rock. These men let the Apostles depart if they willed it. But Paulinus, Prefect~
of the soldiers, when he heard what was come to pass, strove to turn away~
Processus and Martinian from their purpose. And when he found that he but wasted~
time, he ordered their faces to be bruised and their teeth to be broken, with~
stones. Moreover, when he had had them led to the image of Jupiter, and they~
still boldly answered that they would not worship the gods, he caused them to be~
tormented on the rack, and white-hot plates of metal to be put to their flesh,~
and that they should be beaten with sticks. While they were suffering all~
these things they were heard to say only this one word Blessed be the Name of~
the Lord. They were afterwards cast into prison, and in a little while they were~
taken outside the city, and slain with the axe, upon the Aurelian Way. The Lady~
Lucina buried their bodies upon her own farm, upon the 2nd day of July, but they~
were afterwards brought into the City, and are buried in the Church of the~
Prince of the Apostles.
