Happy while hidden in Nazareth's shade
Hearts overflowing and voices raised high,

Toil worn, thy hands for love of thy blest ones,
Willingly labor.

Many the lessons of life hast thou given,
Showing how toil, how the sweat of the workshop
Blessed becometh.

Rein thou the greedy, fomenters of strife
Proper the members of Christ's Mystic Body
With thy protection.

Make us to imitate Joseph our father,
Living and dying. Amen.

Lesson from the book of Genesis
!Gen 1:27-28,31; 2:1-3
27 And God created man to his own image; to the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.
28 And God blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it, and rule over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and all living creatures that move upon the earth.
31 And God saw all the things that he had made, and they were very good. And the evening and morning were the sixth day.
1 So the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the furniture of them. 
2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made: and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done. 
3 And he blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.

[Responsory1]
R. Six days shall you labor, and shall do all your works, but on the seventh day~
is the sabbath of the Lord your God.
* You shall do no work on it, alleluia.
V. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and rested on the seventh day.
R. You shall do no work on it, alleluia.

[Lectio2]
!Gen 2:7-9,15
7 And the Lord God formed man of the slime of the earth: and breathed into his face the breath of life, and man became a living soul. 
8 And the Lord God had planted a paradise of pleasure from the beginning: wherein he placed man whom he had formed. 
9 And the Lord God brought forth of the ground all manner of trees, fair to behold, and pleasant to eat of: the tree of life also in the midst of paradise: and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
15 And the Lord God took man, and put him into the paradise of pleasure, to dress it, and to keep it.

[Responsory2]
R. The Lord put the man whom He had formed, in the paradise of pleasure,
* To till and keep it, alleluia.

17 And to Adam the Lord God said: Because you have hearkened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded you, that you should not eat, cursed is the earth in your work: with labour and toil shall you eat thereof all the days of your life. 
18 Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to you, and you shall eat the herbs of the earth. 
19 In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread till you return to the earth out of which you were taken: for dust you are, and into dust you shall return.
23 And the Lord God sent him out of the paradise of pleasure, to till the earth from which he was taken. 
24 And he cast out Adam: and placed before the paradise of pleasure Cherubims, and a flaming sword, turning every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.

From the Acts of Pope Pius XII

The Church, most provident Mother of All, expends the greatest efforts for the protection and relief of the workers, erecting and promoting for them societies which Pius XII, the Supreme Pontiff, now wishes to be entrusted to the most powerful patronage of St. Joseph. For St. Joseph, since he was reckoned the father of Christ, who deigned to be called the son of a workman, on account of the irrevocable bond which united him to Jesus, drank abundantly of that spirit which ennobles and elevates labor. In like manner, associations of workers ought to be aware of the same kind of spirit, so that Christ may always be present in them, in their members, in their families and in fact in every labor organization, because the chief purpose of these associations is to foster and nourish the Christian life in their members, to spread the Kingdom of God more widely, especially among fellow workers in the same plant.

[Responsory4]
R. You shall not calumniate your neighbor, nor oppress him by violence.
* The wages of him who has been hired by you shall not be withheld from him overnight, alleluia.
V. The laborer is worthy of his wages.
R. The wages of him who has been hired by you shall not be withheld from him overnight, alleluia.

[Lectio5]
The same Pontiff supplied a new proof of the Church's solicitude for labor organization,

[Responsory5]
R. He shall set his children under her shelter, and shall lodge under her branches by her shall he be covered from heat,
* And in her glory shall he dwell. Alleluia.
V. Trust in Him, ye congregation of the people, pour out your heart before Him.
R. And in her glory shall he dwell. Alleluia.

[Lectio6]
There can be no doubt that Christ still treateth Joseph in heaven with that familiarity, honour, and most high condescension which He paid him, like a Son to a father, while He walked among men; nay, rather, that He hath now crowned and completed those habits. We may very reasonably suspect that it was with a peculiar meaning that Christ said (to him) Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord. The joy of being blessed for ever entereth into the heart of man, but when the Lord said (to Joseph), Enter thou into joy, He probably meant mystically to bid him realise a joy which should not be within him only, but outside him also, above him, and below him, and all round about him, and overflowing him as it~
were a great bottomless pit of joy to swallow him up altogether. Therefore, O thou blessed Joseph! remember us! In thy helpful prayers, make intercession for us with Him Who vouchsafed to be supposed thy Son! Likewise, obtain some pity for us from that most blessed Maiden who was thy wife, and the Mother of Him, Who, with the Father and the Holy Ghost, liveth and reigneth, one God, world without end. Amen.

[Responsory6]
R. Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear.
* Though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident. Alleluia.
V. My praise shall be continually of thee, for Thou art my strong refuge.
R.* Though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident. Alleluia.
&Gloria
R. Though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident. Alleluia.

From the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 3:21
And at that time: When all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized and praying, the heaven was opened. And so on.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!Book ii., on the Harmony of the Evangelists.
And Jesus Himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the Son of Joseph. These words, as was supposed, were evidently here written for the correction of such as might think that the Lord was the Son of Joseph, in the same sense as other men are called the children of their fathers. Those who find any trouble in the fact that the ancestors reckoned downward by Matthew from David to Joseph, are other than those reckoned upward by Luke from Joseph to David, such, I say, as are troubled by this, may get over it by supposing that Joseph had two fathers; one, that is, who begat him, and another who adopted him. The custom of adopting children, whereby those who have none of their own surround themselves with a family, is very ancient, even among the people of God. Hence, Luke is understood to have included in his Gospel, under the name of father of Joseph, that, not of the father by whom he was begotten, but of him by whom he was adopted, and it is the ancestors of this adoptive father who are reckoned up as far as David.

[Responsory7]
R. Joseph, thou Son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife; for That Which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth a Son;
* And thou shalt call His Name Jesus. Alleluia.
V. For He shall save His people from their sins.
R. And thou shalt call His Name Jesus. Alleluia.

[Lectio8]
Thus since we are behoven to believe that what each of the Evangelists said was true, Matthew as well as Luke; and therefore that one of them nameth the father who begat, and the other, the father who adopted, Joseph; we naturally suppose that the Evangelist, who nameth the adoptive father, was he who abstaineth from using the term beget.Matthew beginneth (i. 2) Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob, and so on, always with the use of this word begat, till he cometh to: and Jacob begat Joseph. By the word which he useth he doth sufficiently indicate that the genealogy which he is giving is that of him who begat.

[Responsory8]
R. Arise, and take the young Child, and His Mother, and flee into Egypt;
* And be thou there until I bring thee word. Alleluia.
V. That it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophets, saying Out of Egypt have I called My Son.
R. And be thou there until I bring thee word. Alleluia.
&Gloria
R. And be thou there until I bring thee word. Alleluia.

[Lectio9]
Luke saith Joseph was the son of Heli, not Joseph was begotten of Heli; but even if he had said the latter, it would not have troubled this interpretation of ours, that one Evangelist nameth the natural, and the other the adoptive father of Joseph. It is not an outrageous thing to say that one who adopteth another hath begotten him, albeit he hath done it, not carnally, but by love. Even so hath God given to us the power to become His sons, albeit He hath not begotten us of His Own Nature and Substance, as He hath His Only - Begotten Son, but only reckoneth us, in His love, among His children.
