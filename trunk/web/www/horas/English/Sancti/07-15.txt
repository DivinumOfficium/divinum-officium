[Oratio]
O God, Who on this day took St. Henry, thy Confessor, to the everlasting~
kingdom from the throne of an earthly empire; we humbly beseech thee, that as thou~
enabled him, protected by the abundance of thy grace, to overcome the~
temptations of the world, so grant that we, in emulation of him, may shun the~
allurements of this world and come to thee with pure hearts.
$Per Dominum

[Lectio4]
Henry II., surnamed the Pious, became successively Duke of Bavaria, (in the~
year 995,) King of Germany, (in 1002,) and the Emperor of the Romans, (in 1014.)~
His hope soared beyond the short enjoyment of a fleeting kingdom, and he~
aimed at the possession of an unfading crown by living as the loyal servant of~
the Eternal King. After he became Emperor, he earnestly set himself to the~
furtherance of the cause of godliness. He restored with new splendour the~
Churches which had been ruined by the unbelievers, and enriched them with many~
offerings and possessions. Monasteries and other godly places he either built~
himself, or endowed them with allowances. He founded out of his own family~
inheritance the Bishopric of Bamberg, and made it tributary to Blessed Peter and~
to the Bishop of Rome. When Benedict VIII., who had set on his head the Imperial~
crown, was an exile, he hospitably received him, and afterwards restored him to~
his See.

[Lectio5]
Then he was struck down with a grievous sickness in the Monastery of Monte~
Cassino, he was healed by an evident miracle through the intercession of St~
Benedict. He was a princely benefactor to the Church of Rome, for the defence of~
which he entered into a war against the Greeks, and took again from them the~
province of Apulia, which they had long possessed. He never undertook anything~
until he had made it a subject of prayer. And in battle he once saw the Angel of~
the Lord and the Holy Martyrs (Laurence, George, and Adrian) his patrons under~
whose protection he had placed his army, fighting for him in front of his line.~
With the help of God, he prevailed against the tribes of savages more by prayer~
than by arms. He gave his sister in marriage to King Stephen of Hungary, whom he~
induced to be baptized, and so brought all that country to believe in Christ.~
His marriage with the holy maiden Cunegunda is one of the rare instances of the~
union of two virgins. When he drew near to death, he gave her back inviolate to~
her kinsfolk.

[Lectio6]
He managed with great wisdom whatever could tend to the honour and usefulness of~
the Empire. He left in France? Italy, and Germany, splendid monuments of his~
godly munificence. The perfume of his saintly life spread its sweetness far and~
wide, and the glory of his holiness outshone the splendour of his crown. When~
the work of his life was done, he was called by the Lord to the possession of an~
eternal kingdom (on the 14th day of July,) in the year of salvation 1024. His~
body was buried in the Church of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul at Bamberg,~
and God glorified him by the miracles which began forthwith to take place at his~
grave. The same being duly proved, Eugenius III. numbered him among the Saints.

[Lectio94]
Henry, surnamed the Pious, was first Duke of Bavaria, then King of Germany, and finally Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. He devoted himself zealously to the spread of religion. The bishopric of Bamberg, which he had founded with his family wealth, he made tributary of St. Peter and the Roman Pontiff. He received Benedict VIII when he was a fugitive and restored him to his See. To protect the Roman Church, he undertook a war against the Greeks and recovered Apulia, which they had held for a long time. Protected by divine aid, he fought the barbarian nations more with prayers than with force of arms. When Hungary was still pagan, he gave his sister in marriage to its king, Stephen, who was baptized and brought the whole kingdom to the faith. Henry joined matrimony with holy virginity, and when he was near death he restored St. Cunegunda, his wife, as a virgin to her family. Finally, even more famous for his holiness than for his temporal rule, he was called to the reward of the heavenly kingdom in the year 1024, and was added to the number of the Saints by Eugene III.
