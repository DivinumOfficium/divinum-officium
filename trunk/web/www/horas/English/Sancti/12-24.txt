Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 1:18-21
When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she~
was found with child, of the Holy Ghost. And so on.
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Book of Commentaries, on Matth. i.
Why was the Lord conceived of an espoused virgin rather than of a free? First,~
for the sake of the genealogy of Mary, which we have obtained by that of Joseph.~
Secondly, because she was thus saved from being stoned by the Jews as an~
adulteress. Thirdly, that Himself and His mother might have a guardian on their~
journey into Egypt. To these, Ignatius, the martyr of Antioch, has added a~
fourth reason namely, that the birth might take place unknown to the devil,~
who would naturally suppose that Mary had conceived by Joseph.

[Responsory1]
R. Sanctify yourselves today, and be ready for on the morrow ye shall see
* The majesty of God upon you.
V. This day ye shall know that the Lord cometh, and in the morning, then ye~
shall see
R. The majesty of God upon you.

[Lectio2]
Before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. She~
was found, that is, by Joseph, but by no one else. He had already almost an~
husband's privilege to know all that concerned her. Before they came together.~
This doth not imply that they ever did come together the Scripture merely~
showeth the absolute fact that up to this time they had not done so.

[Responsory2]
R. Stand still, and ye shall see the help of the Lord with you O Judah and~
Jerusalem, fear not.
* Tomorrow ye shall go out, and the Lord will be with you.
V. Sanctify yourselves, O ye children of Israel, and be ready.
R. Tomorrow ye shall go out, and the Lord will be with you.

[Lectio3]
Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public~
example, was minded to put her away privily. If any man be joined to a~
fornicatress they become one body; and according to the law they that are privy~
to a crime are thereby guilty. How then can it be that Joseph is described as a~
just man, at the very time he was compounding the criminality of his espoused?~
It must have been that he knew her to be pure, and yet understood not the~
mystery of her pregnancy, but, while he wondered at that which had happened, was~
willing to hold his peace.

[Responsory3]
R. Sanctify yourselves, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord, for on the~
morrow the Lord will come down.
* And will take away from you all sickness. 
V. On the morrow the sins of the earth shall be washed away, and the Saviour of~
the world will be our King.
R. And will take away from you all sickness.
&Gloria
R. And will take away from you all sickness.
