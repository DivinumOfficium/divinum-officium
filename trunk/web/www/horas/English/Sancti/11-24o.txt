[Oratio]
Give ear, O Lord, unto our prayers, and grant that we who acknowledge ourselves~
guilty through our own iniquity, may be delivered at the petition of thy blessed~
Martyr Chrysogonus.
$Per Dominum

[Lectio93]
Chrysogonus was imprisoned at Rome in the reign of the Emperor Diocletian. There~
he lived for the space of two years upon the alms of the holy Anastasia. She was~
suffering much persecution from her husband Publius for Christ's Name's sake,~
and was used to write to Chrysogonus to ask for the help of his prayers, and he~
in return comforted her by his epistles. Presently the Emperor wrote to Rome~
commanding the rest of the Christians who were in prison there to be put to~
death, and Chrysogonus to be sent to himself at Aquileia. When he was brought~
thither, he said unto him I have sent for thee, O Chrysogonus, that I may~
increase thine honours, if only thou wilt bring thy mind to worship the gods.~
Thereto Chrysogonus answered With my mind and with my prayers I worship Him~
Who is God indeed, but such gods as are nothing but images of devils, them I~
hate and curse. Then was the Emperor kindled to fury at this answer, and~
commanded Chrysogonus to be beheaded at Aquae Gradatae upon the 24th day of~
November. His body was cast into the sea, but found a little while afterwards~
washed up upon the shore, and the Priest Zoilus took it and buried it in his own~
house.
