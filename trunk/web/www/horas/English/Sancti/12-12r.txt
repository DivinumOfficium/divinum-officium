[Ant 1]
I have chosen and made holy this place * That my name may be there, and mine eyes, and my heart may remain there for all the days.

[Ant 3]
Lift up thine eyes * round about, and see: all they gather themselves together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side.

[Oratio]
v. O God, who hast placed us under the special patronage of the most Blessed Virgin Mary, and hast been pleased to shower perpetual blessings upon us: grant to Thy suppliants; that, as we are brought joy on earth by the commemoration today, we may enjoy her sight in heaven.
$Per Dominum

[Hymnus Matutinum]
Blest guardian of all virgin souls,
Portal of bliss to man forgiven,
Pure Mother of Almighty God,
Thou hope of earth and joy of heaven!
_
Fair Lily found among the thorn,
Most beauteous Dove with wings of gold,
Rod from whose tender root upsprang
That healing Flower so long foretold
_
Thou Tower against the dragon proof,
Thou Star to stormtossed voyagers dear;
Our course lies o'er a treacherous deep,
thine be the light by which we steer.
_
Scatter the mists that round us hang;
Keep far the fatal shoals away;
And while through darkling waves we sweep,
Open a path to light and day.
_
O Jesu, born of Virgin bright,
Immortal glory be to thee;
Praise to the Father infinite
And Holy Ghost eternally.
Amen.

[Lectio94]
In the year 1531, according the religious tradition of Mexico, Mary, the Virgin Mother of God, appeared on Mount Tepeyac to a recently baptized Christian, Juan Diego, and gave him a message for Bishop Juan de Zumarraga - a commission which she urgently repeated that a church was to be built there in her honor. The bishop, however, asked for a sign. Two days later, the neophyte set out to get a priest to administer the Last Sacraments to his and he took a route that not bring him too near the place of the apparitions. But his loving Mother favored him with a third visit, assured him of his uncles good health, and had him gather some roses which had sprung out of season. These she arranged in his tilma or cloak, and she told him to take them to the bishop As the roses cascaded to the floor of the bishop's audience chain (so the story continues), the picture  of Mary, miraculously imprinted on the tilma, was revealed to those present. The image was ut first kept in the bishop's oratory then moved to the hermitage that had been built on Mount Tepceyac, and finally placed in the great basilica which became the goal of crowds of Mexican  pilgrims, drawn there by their devotion to Mary and by the reports ol frequent miracles. Having the Blessed Virgin Mary of Guadalupe as an ever present protectress, the Mexican bishops, with the approval of all the people, chose her as the primary Patron of the Mexican nation; and this choice was duly approved by the apostolic authority of Pope Benedict XIV. On Columbus Day, October 12, 1895, Pope Leo XIII, acting through the archbishop of Mexico, adorned the holy image with a golden crown. And St. Pius X declared Our Lady of Guadalupe Patroness of all of Latin America.

$Deo gratias

[Hymnus Laudes]
v. Kindly Mother like no other
Free from all corrupting stain,
Thou he preferred who death deterred
Breaking all its bonds in twain.
_
Mercifully give us fully
To rejoice in true light's light,
We who cling to thy feasts bring to
Them joy that is meet and right.
_
May we receive grace to believe,
Pray too that faith's power soar,
And that fragile minds be agile,
Strengthen hope and love still more.
_
Themes of dirges, war and scourges,
Hunger, plagues and massacres,
Far be removed that thou be proved
Dawn of hope for sufferers.
_
Consolation 'gainst frustration
May sad hearts and fetters feel,
Answer the prayers, also the cares
That all sense thy pow'r to heal.
_
Friendly be foe while here below,
Evil-do'rs likewise subdue,
Bringing peaceful indeed gleeful
Times to gladden hearts anew.
_
By thy passion and compassion
Grantus help in all our needs
That forever reigning, never
Cease our lauds for thy Son's deeds.
_
Father true God and Son true God,
God the Holy Spirit too,
Trinity God, Unity God,
Rule forever, as is due. Amen.
