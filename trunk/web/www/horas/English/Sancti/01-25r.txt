[Ant 1]
Ananias, go thy way * and seek Saul for, behold, he prayeth for he is a chosen~
vessel unto Me, to bear My name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children~
of Israel.

[Invit]
For the conversion of the Teacher of the Gentiles, * let us praise our God.

[Lectio1]
From the Acts of Apostles.
!Acts 9:1-5
1 And Saul, as yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the~
disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,
2 And asked of him letters to Damascus, to the synagogues: that if he found any~
men and women of this way, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
3 And as he went on his journey, it came to pass that he drew nigh to Damascus;~
and suddenly a light from heaven shined round about him.
4 And falling on the ground, he heard a voice saying to him: Saul, Saul, why~
persecutest thou me?
5 Who said: Who art thou, Lord? And he: I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. It is~
hard for thee to kick against the goad.

[Lectio2]
!Acts 9:6-9
6 And he trembling and astonished, said: Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?
7 And the Lord said to him: Arise, and go into the city, and there it shall be~
told thee what thou must do. Now the men who went in company with him, stood~
amazed, hearing indeed a voice, but seeing no man.
8 And Saul arose from the ground; and when his eyes were opened, he saw nothing.~
But they leading him by the hands, brought him to Damascus.
9 And he was there three days, without sight, and he did neither eat nor drink.

[Lectio4]
!Acts 9:10-16
10 Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias. And the Lord~
said to him in a vision: Ananias. And he said: Behold I am here, Lord.
11 And the Lord said to him: Arise, and go into the street that is called Straight,~
and seek in the house of Judas, one named Saul of Tarsus. For behold he prayeth.
12 And he saw a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hands upon him,~
that he might receive his sight.
13 But Ananias answered: Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil~
he hath done to thy saints in Jerusalem.
14 And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that invoke thy~
name.
15 And the Lord said to him: Go thy way; for this man is to me a vessel of~
election, to carry my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of~
Israel.
16 For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.
