!Commemoratio for the Holy Martyr Gorgonitis.
Gorgonius was a native of Nicomedia, and one of the chamberlains of the Emperor~
Diocletian. He, with the help of a fellow-chamberlain named Dorotheus, brought~
all the other chamber-servants to believe in Christ. Both of them one day saw a~
martyr hideously tortured in the presence of Diocletian, and the example of his~
testimony roused them both up to desire the same, and they both said: Why, O~
Emperor, dost thou punish this man only, by condemning an opinion which we share~
with him? His belief is our belief. Our will is the same. The Emperor thereupon~
ordered them to be bound and scourged till their bodies were perfectly flayed,~
and a mixture of vinegar and salt poured into the wounds. Soon after he~
commanded them to be bound again and grilled on bars over hot coals. Finally,~
after a variety of tortures, they were hanged. The body of the holy Gorgonius~
was some time brought to Rome, and buried between the two laurel-trees upon~
the Latin Way, but, afterwards, during the Pontificate of Gregory IV., it was~
brought into the Church of the Prince of the Apostles.

[Oratio]
O Lord, may thine holy servant Gorgonius gladden us by his prayers, and make~
this his blessed Festival to be unto us indeed a day of rejoicing.
