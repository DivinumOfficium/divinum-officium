[Name]
Basil

[Oratio]
Hear, O Lord, we beseech thee, the prayers which we offer thee on this the~
solemn feast-day of thy blessed Confessor and bishop Basil, and, for the sake of~
him who so nobly served thee, forgive us our trespasses.
$Per Dominum

[Lectio4]
This Basil was a noble Cappadocian v who studied earthly learning at Athens, in~
company with Gregory of Nazianzus, to whom he was united in a warm and tender~
friendship. He afterwards studied things sacred in a monastery, where he quickly~
attained an eminent degree of excellence in doctrine and life, whereby he gained~
to himself the surname of the Great. He was called to Pontus to preach the~
Gospel of Christ Jesus, and brought back into the way of salvation that country~
which before had been wandering astray from the rules of Christian discipline.~
He was shortly united as coadjutor to Eusebius, Bishop of Cassarea, for the~
edification of that city, and afterwards became his successor in the see. One of~
his greatest labours was to maintain that the Son is of one Substance with the~
Father, and when the Emperor Valens, moved to wrath against him, was willing to~
send him into exile, he so bent him by dint of the miracles which he worked that~
he forced him to forego his intention.

[Lectio5]
The chair upon which Valens sat down, in order to sign the decree of Basil's~
ejectment from the city, broke down under him, and three pens which he took one~
after the other to sign the edict of banishment, all would not write and when~
nevertheless he remained firm to write the ungodly order, his right hand shook.~
Valens was so frightened at these omens, that he tore the paper in two. During~
the night which was allowed to Basil to make up his mind, Valens' wife had a~
severe stomach-ache, and their only son was taken seriously ill. These things~
alarmed Valens so much that he acknowledged his wickedness, and sent for Basil,~
during whose visit the child began to get better. However, when Valens sent for~
some heretics to see it, it presently died.

[Lectio6]
The abstinence and self-control of Basil were truly wonderful. He was content to~
wear nothing but one single garment. In observance of fasting he was most~
earnest, and so instant in prayer, that he would oftentimes pass the whole night~
therein. His virginity he kept always unsullied. He built monasteries, wherein~
he so adapted the institution of monasticism, that he exquisitely united for the~
inmates the advantages of the contemplative and of the active life. He was the~
author of many learned writings, and, according to the witness of Gregory of~
Nazianzus, no one hath ever composed more faithful and edifying explanations of~
the books of the Holy Scripture. He died upon the 1st day of January, (in the~
year of our Lord 379,) at which time so essentially spiritual was his life, that~
his body showed nothing but skin and bones.

[Lectio7]
From the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 14:26-35
At that time Jesus said unto the multitudes If any man come to Me, and hate~
not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters,~
yea, and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple. And so on.
_
Homily by St Basil, Archbishop of Caesarea.
!Paraphrase of his Rule.
This is perfect self-renunciation, when we attain to indifference as regards our~
own lives, and wring from death himself the confession that our trust is not in~
our own strength. The first step toward this crown of abnegation is to estrange~
ourselves from outward things, such as property, public reputation, habits of~
life, and affection for things unnecessary, whereof the immediate disciples of~
our Holy Lord have left us a fine example James, for instance, and John, who~
left their father Zebedee and the boats which were their only means of getting~
their daily bread or Matthew, who got up from the receipt of custom, and~
straightway followed the Lord.

[Lectio8]
But what need have we for our own arguments, or for the examples of holy men to~
confirm what we say, when we are able to cite the very words of the Lord Himself,~
and by them to move any earnest soul that loveth God Such were they unto whom~
He plainly and unhesitatingly declared Whosoever he be of you that forsaketh~
not all that he hath, he cannot be My disciple. And again, in another place,~
when He had said If thou wilt be perfect, go, and sell that thou hast, and~
give to the poor the completion of the sentence was, And come and follow Me.~
(Matth. xix. 19.)

[Lectio9]
This then, as we have taught, is self-renunciation to unlock the chains of this~
earthly life, which passeth away, and to set oneself free from the business of~
men, and so to make ourselves lither and meeter to enter on that path which~
leadeth to God, and let our reason be more unhampered to gain and to use those~
things which are far more precious than gold or precious stones. (Ps. xviii.~
11.) In short, it is to have our heart in heaven and not on earth, so as to be~
able to say Our conversation is in heaven. (Phil. iii. 20.) And (which is the~
great thing) this is the first step towards the attaining to be like Christ, who,~
though He was rich, yet for our sakes He became poor. (2 Cor. viii. 9.)
&teDeum

[Lectio94]
Basil, a Cappodocian nobleman, studied profane letters at Athens together with his close friend, Gregory of Nazianzus, and took his sacred studies in a monastery. Becoming marvellously proficient in both, he soon attained such excellence in learning and in his way of life that from then on he was given the name of The Great. Summoned to preach the Gospel of Christ Jesus in Pontus, he called that province back to the way of salvation. Soon he was asked by Eusebius, Bishop of Caesarea, to aid him in teaching ; and he succeeded Eusebius as bishop. Basil was among the first to defend the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father ; and by his miracles he caused Emperor Valens, who was angry with him and threatening him with exile, to give up any such intentions. Basil's abstinence and continence were marvelled at ; and he was constant in prayer, often spending the whole night in it. He built monasteries, ordering the monastic life so that it would best combine the advantages of the solitary life with those of the active life. He wrote many learned books ; and, as Gregory of Nazianzus testifieth, no one hath explained the books of Holy Scripture more truly and fruitfully. He died on the 1st day of January.
