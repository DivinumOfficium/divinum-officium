[Lectio4]
Ephrem genere Syrius, Nisibeno patre natus est. Adhuc juvenis ad sanctum Jacobum~
episcopum se contulit, a quo baptizatus, brevi ita sanctitate et doctrina~
profecit, ut in scola Nisibi, Mesopotamiae urbae, florente magister fuerit~
constitutus. Post Jacobi episcopy mortem, Nisibi a Persis capta, Edessam~
profectus est; ubi primum in monte inter monachos consodit, deinde, ut plurimos~
ad se confluentes homines vitaret, vitam duxit eremiticam. Edessenae ecclesiae~
diaconus ordinatus, et ob humilitatem sacerdotium recusans, omnium virtutum~
splendore enituit, et pietatem et religionem vera sapientiae professione sibi~
comparare sategit. Spem omnem in solo Deo defixam habens, quaevis humana~
ac transitoria contemnens, divina ac sempiterna assidue concupiscebat.

Caesaream Cappadociae, divino ductus Spiritu, cum petiisset, ipsum ibi os Ecclesiae Basilium~
vidit, et uterque mutua consuetudine opportunum in modum usus est. Ad~
innumeros errores refellendos, qui, tunc temporis grassantes, Ecclesiam Dei~
divexabant, atque ad mysteria Domini nostri Jesu Christi sedulo illustranda,~
plurimas edidit lucubrationes, Syro sermone compositas, et fere omnes in~
linguam Graecam versas; atque, teste sancto Hieronymo, ipse ad tantum venit~
claritudinem, ut, post lectionem Scripturarum, publice in quibusdam ecclesiis~
ejus scripta recitarentur.

[Lectio6]
Universa illius opera, tam splendido doctrinae lumine referta effecerunt, ut~
idem Sanctus, adhuc vivens, tamquam Ecclesiae Doctor, magno honore habitus~
fuerit. Metrica quoque cantica composuit in laudem beatissimae Virginis~
Mariae ac Sanctorum: quam ob causam a Syris Spiritus Sancti cithara merito~
fuit appellatus. In mirifica ac pia devotione erga eamdem Virginem immaculatam primum excelluit. Meritis plenus, Edessae, in Mesopotamia, decimo ~
quarto Kalendas Julii, decessit sub Valente principe: eumque, Benedictus papa decimus quintus ex sacrorum Rituum Congregationis consulto,~
universalis Ecclesiae Doctorem declaravit.

From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 5:13-19
At that time Jesus said unto His disciples Ye are the salt of the earth. But~
if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted And so on.

Homily of St. Ephrem of Syria Deacon
!Sermo de vita et exercitatione monastica
Praeclarum est bonum inchoare atque perficere, et gratum Deo esse et utilem proximo,~
ipsique summo ac dulcissimo rectori nostro Christo Jesu placere, qui ait: Vos estis~
sal terrae, et columna caelorum. Labor afflictionis tuae, dilectissime, tamquam~
somnus est; porro laboris requies inenarrabilis atque inaestimabilis. Attende ergo~
tibi ipsi sollicite, ne utrumque pariter amittas, dum neutrum plene persequeris,~
praesentem scilicet sempiternamque laetitiam. Stude potius perfectam virtutem consegui,~
ornatam atque insignitam omnibus quae diligit Deus. Hanc si assequaris, quam~
irritabis Deum, ique proximum tuum violabis.

[Lectio8]
Porro virtus ista, unica uniusque specie dicitur, variarum virtutum in se ipsa~
labens pulchritudinem. Diadema regium absque pretiosis lapidibus~
candentibusque margaritis connecti texique non potest; ita et haec unica~
virtus sine variarum fulgore virtutum constare nequit. Est enim profecto~
simillima diademati regio. Nam, ut illi, si lapis unus aut margarita defuerit,~
in regio capite lucere pleniter nequit; ita et haec unica virtus, nisi virtutum~
ceterarum honore conseritur, perfecta virtus non appellatur. Similis item est~
preciosissimis epulis, exquisitissimis condimentis praeparatis, sed sale~
carentibus. Sicut enim pretiosi illi cibi sine sale comedi nequeunt; ita et ista~
virtus uniformis, si variarum virtutum gloria et honore decoretur, absit autem~
Dei proximique dilectio, vilis prorsus atque contemptibilis est.

[Lectio93]
Mark and Marcellian were two brothers, Romans, who were arrested by Duke Fabian~
for believing in Christ, and fastened to a beam, to which their feet were~
nailed. The Judge said to them Wretched creatures, do think for a moment, and~
free yourselves from such suffering. But they answered him We have never~
enjoyed any dinner so much as we do what we are now undergoing here for Jesus~
Christ's sake. We have got ourselves a little fast to His love now. Would that~
He would let us suffer this as long as we are clad in this corruptible body.~
Still suffering, they for a day and a night sang the praises of God continually,~
and in the end were thrust through with darts, and so attained the glory of~
Martyrdom. Their bodies are buried upon the Way to Ardea.

[Lectio94]
Ephrem was a Syrian, the son of a citizen of Nisibis. In his youth he betook himself to the holy Bishop James, who baptized him, and in a short while he attained such sanctity and learning that he was made a master of the flourishing school at Nisibis. He was ordained deacon of the church at Edessa, but refused the priesthood, out of humility. He shone with the splendour of the all virtues. He produced many elaborate literary works to banish the innumerable errors troubling the Church of God. All his works were so infused with the splendour of learning that even while he was yet living he was given the honor of being regarded as a Doctor of the Church.

Ephraem was of Syrian stock, his father being a citizen of Nisibis. While he was still young, he went to the holy bishop James to be baptized. In a short time he advanced so much in holiness and learning that he was made master of a flourishing school at Nisibis, a city in Mesopotamia. Ordained deacon of the Church of Edessa, and refusing the priesthood out of humility, he shone with the splendour of all virtues, and sought to acquire devotion and religion by the profession of true wisdom. All his works, illuminated with the bright light of learning, caused this Saint to be treated with great honour as a Doctor of the Church even in his lifetime. He excelled, above all, in a wonderful and loving devotion to the immaculate Virgin. Rich in merits, he died on the 18th day of June at Edessa in Mesopotamia, under the Emperor Valens. Pope Benedict XV, after consulting the Congregation of Sacred Rites, declared him a Doctor of the universal Church.
