Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Romans
!Rom 2:1-4
1 Wherefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest. For wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself. For thou dost the same things which thou judgest. 
2 For we know that the judgment of God is, according to truth, against them that do such things. 
3 And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them who do such things, and dost the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God? 
4 Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and patience, and longsuffering? Knowest thou not, that the benignity of God leadeth thee to penance?

!Rom 2:5-8
5 But according to thy hardness and impenitent heart, thou treasurest up to thyself wrath, against the day of wrath, and revelation of the just judgment of God.
6 Who will render to every man according to his works. 
7 To them indeed, who according to patience in good work, seek glory and honour and incorruption, eternal life: 
8 But to them that are contentious, and who obey not the truth, but give credit to iniquity, wrath and indignation

[Responsory2]
R. O ye shepherds, speak, and tell us what ye have seen; who is appeared in the~

V. Speak; what have ye seen? And tell us of the Birth of Christ.
R. We saw the new-born Child, and Angels singing praise to the Lord.
V. Glória Patri, et Fílio, * et Spirítui Sancto.
R. We saw the new-born Child, and Angels singing praise to the Lord.

!Rom 2:9-13
9 Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that worketh evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek. 
10 But glory, and honour, and peace to every one that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
11 For there is no respect of persons with God. 
12 For whosoever have sinned without the law, shall perish without the law; and whosoever have sinned in the law, shall be judged by the law. 
13 For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.

From the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 2:15-20
In that time the shepherds said one to another: Let us go over to Bethlehem, and~
let us see this word that is come to pass, which the Lord hath shewed to us. And~
they came with haste. And so on.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!Bk. ii. on Luke ii.
The shepherds came with haste. This is how every one cometh who is really~
earnestly seeking Christ. The shepherds believed the angel. Wilt not thou~
believe Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, Angels, Prophets, and Apostles? Here also~
remark how carefully every word in the Scripture is chosen. They came with haste~
to see this Word, (as the original text hath it. ) A Word, indeed; the Word of~
God. He that saw the Lord's Flesh, saw the Word, that is, God the Son.

[Lectio8]
Because the office of a shepherd is mean, think not meanly of the example of~
their faith. Verily, that which is poorest in learning is richest in faith. The~
Lord seeketh not for schools crowded with wise men, but for a people of a single~
heart unused to overlay and to disguise what they learn, by vain and superfluous~
adornments. He will have straightforwardness rather than vain-glory.

[Responsory8]
R. How is the King of heaven attended? He that containeth the world is laid in a~
stable
* Lying in a manger, reigning in heaven.
V. Unto us is born, this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, Which is Christ~
the Lord.
R. Lying in a manger, reigning in heaven.
&Gloria
R. Lying in a manger, reigning in heaven.

[Lectio9]
Think not meanly either of the shepherds' words. The shepherds strengthen the~
faith even of Mary; the shepherds lead God's people to His worship. For, all~
they that heard it, wondered at those things which were told them by the~
shepherds. But Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart. Let us~
learn the modesty of the Holy Virgin, that modesty of speech as of body, whereby~
she laid up in her heart the evidences of her faith.
