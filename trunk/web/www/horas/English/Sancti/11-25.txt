[Oratio]
O God, Who didst give the Law unto Moses upon the top of Mount Sinai, and there~
didst cause the body of thy blessed Virgin and Martyr Katharine to be~
marvellously laid by thine holy Angels, grant unto us, we beseech thee, for her~
sake and at her prayers, that we may finally attain unto that mountain which is~
Christ.
$Qui tecum

[Lectio4]
This Katharine was a noble maiden of Alexandria, who from her earliest years~
joined the study of the liberal arts with fervent faith, and in a short while~
came to such an height of holiness and learning, that when she was eighteen~
years of age she prevailed over the chiefest wits. When she saw many diversely~
tormented and haled to death by command of Maximin, because they professed the~
Christian religion, she went boldly unto him and rebuked him for his savage~
cruelty, bringing forward likewise most sage reasons why the faith of Christ~
should be needful for salvation.

[Lectio5]
Maximian marvelled at her wisdom, and bade keep her, while he gathered together~
the most learned men from all quarters and offered them great rewards if they~
would confute Katharine and bring her from believing in Christ to worship idols.~
But the event fell contrariwise, for many of the philosophers who had come to~
dispute with her were overcome by the force and skill of her reasoning, so that~
the love of Christ Jesus was kindled in them, and they were content even to die~
for His sake. Then did Maximin strive to beguile Katharine with fair words and~
promises, and when he found it was lost pains, he caused her to be hided, and~
bruised with lead-laden whips, and so cast into prison, and neither meat nor~
drink given to her for the space of eleven days.

[Lectio6]
At that time Maximin's wife and Porphyry the Captain of his host, went to the~
prison to see the damsel, and at her preaching believed in Jesus Christ, and~
were afterwards crowned with martyrdom. Then was Katharine brought out of ward,~
and a wheel was set, wherein were fastened many and sharp blades, so that her~
virgin body might thereby be most direfully cut and torn in pieces, but in a~
little while, as Katharine prayed, this machine was broken in pieces, at the~
which marvel many believed in Christ. But Maximin was hardened in his~
godlessness and cruelty, and commanded to behead Katharine. She bravely offered~
her neck to the stroke and passed away hence to receive the twain crowns of~
maidenhood and martyrdom, upon the 25 th day of November. Her body was~
marvellously laid by Angels upon Mount Sinai in Arabia.

[Lectio94]
Catherine was a noble virgin of Alexandria who united a zeal tor the liberal~
arts with an ardent faith. When she saw many Christians given up to torture by~
Maximin, she went to him and strongly stated the necessity of faith in Christ~
for salvation. Wondering at her wisdom, the tyrant commanded her to be held, and,~
assembling the most learned men from all sides, he tried to persuade her to turn~
to the worship of idols. But the opposite happened; many of those men were~
convinced by Catherine's wise reasoning and embraced the faith of Christ and did~
not hesitate to die for it. Because of this, Maximim tried promises first and~
then threats to win Catherine from her conviction; but, when nothing succeeded,~
he had her beheaded with an axe.
