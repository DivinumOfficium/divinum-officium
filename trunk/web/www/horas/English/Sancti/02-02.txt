How wonderful is the dealing here! * The Maker of man hath taken to Himself a living body, and hath been pleased to be born of the Virgin; He is come forth conceived without seed, and hath made us partakers of His Divine nature.;;109
When, in an unspeakable manner, * Thou wast born of a Virgin, the Scriptures were fulfilled; to save man, Thou earnest down as dew upon the fleece we praise thee, O our God!;;112
Mother of God, when Moses * saw the bush unconsumed, we own that it was a figure of the preservation of thy most wonderful virginity; pray for us.;;121
The Root of Jesse hath blossomed, * the star is arisen out of Jacob, the Virgin hath given birth to the Saviour; we praise thee, O our God!;;126
Behold, Mary hath borne * for us a Saviour; John beheld Him and cried, saying: Behold, the Lamb of God, behold Him that taketh away the sins of the world. Alleluia.;;147

11 When the Lord shall have brought thee into the land of the Chanaanite, as~
he swore to thee and thy fathers, and shall give it thee:
12 Thou shalt set apart all that openeth the womb for the Lord, and all that is~
first brought forth of thy cattle: whatsoever thou shalt have of the male sex,~
thou shalt consecrate to the Lord.
13 The firstborn of an ass thou shalt change for a sheep: and if thou do not~
redeem it, thou shalt kill it. And every firstborn of men thou shalt redeem with a~
price.

received seed shall bear a man child, she shall be unclean seven days, according~
to the days of the separation of her flowers.
3 And on the eighth day the infant shall be circumcised:
4 But she shall remain three and thirty days in the blood of her purification.~
She shall touch no holy thing, neither shall she enter into the sanctuary, until~
the days of her purification be fulfilled.
5 But if she shall bear a maid child, she shall be unclean two weeks, according~
to the custom of her monthly courses, and she shall remain in the blood of her~
purification sixty-six days.

daughter, she shall bring to the door of the tabernacle of the testimony, a lamb~
of a year old for a holocaust, and a young pigeon or a turtle for sin, and shall~
deliver them to the priest:
7 Who shall offer them before the Lord, and shall pray for her, and so she shall~
be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This is the law for her that beareth a~
man child or a maid child.

From the Sermons of St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!13th on the Season.
In old time it was written: And of Zion shall it not be said This and that man~
was born in her, and the Highest Himself shall establish her? Blessed be the~
omnipotence of Him That was born! Blessed the glory of Him That came from heaven~
to earth! While yet He was borne in His Mother's womb, He was saluted by John~
the Baptist; He was presented in the temple, and recognised by that famous,~
ancient, and glorious worthy, the old man Simeon. As soon as he knew Him he~
worshipped Him, and said Lord, now lettest Thou thy servant depart in peace~
for mine eyes have seen thy Salvation.

[Responsory4]
R. Simeon was just and devout, waiting for the redemption of Israel
* And the Holy Ghost was upon him.
V. It was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death,~
before he had seen the Lord's Christ.
R. And the Holy Ghost was upon him.

[Lectio5]
He lingered in the world to see the birth of Him Who made the world. The old~
man knew the Child, and in that Child became a child himself, for in the love~
wherewith he regarded the Father of all, he felt his own years to be but as of~
yesterday. The old man Simeon bore the new-born Christ, and all the while,~
Christ was the old man's Lord. It had been told him by the Lord that he should~
not taste of death before he had seen the birth of the Lord's Christ. Now Christ~
is born, and all the old man's wishes on earth are fulfilled. He That came to a~
decrepit world came to an old man.

[Responsory5]
R. It was revealed unto Simeon by the Holy Ghost that he should not see death~
before he had seen the Lord's Christ
* And he blessed God, and said Lord, now lettest Thou thy servant depart in~
peace, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation.
V. When His parents brought in the Child Jesus, to do for Him after the custom~
of the law then took he Him up in his arms.
R. And blessed God, and said Lord, now lettest Thou thy servant depart in~
peace, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation.

[Lectio6]
He wished not to remain long in the world, but he longed to see Christ in the~
world, singing with the Prophet, and saying Shew us thy mercy, O Lord, and~
grant us thy salvation. (Ps. lxxxiv. 8.) And now at last, that ye may know that~
the cause of his joy was that this prayer was granted, he saith Now lettest~
Thou thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation. The~
Prophets have sung that the Maker of heaven and earth would converse on earth~
with men an angel hath declared that the Creator of flesh and spirit would~
come in the flesh the unborn John, yet in the womb, hath saluted the unborn~
Saviour yet in the womb. The old man Simeon hath seen God a little Child.

[Responsory6]
R. When His parents brought the Child Jesus into the temple, to do for Him after~
the custom of the law, Simeon took Him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said:
* Lord, now lettest Thou thy servant depart in peace.
V. Simeon took up the Child in his arms, and cried out, and said
R. Lord, now lettest Thou thy servant depart in peace.
&Gloria
R. Lord, now lettest Thou thy servant depart in peace.

From the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 2:22-32
In that time, after the days of her purification according to the law of Moses~
were accomplished, they carried him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord, as~
it is written in the law of the Lord. And so on.
_
Homily on this passage by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!Bk. 2, Comm. on Luke ii.
And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and the same~
man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel. The birth of the~
Lord is attested not only by Angels and Prophets, and shepherds, but also by~
elders and just men. Every age, and both sexes, as well as the miracles of the~
events themselves, are here to strengthen our faith. A virgin conceiveth, a~
barren woman beareth, a dumb man speaketh, Elizabeth prophesieth, the wise~
man worshippeth, the unborn child leapeth, the widow praiseth, and the just man~
waiteth.

[Responsory7]
R. Simeon took Jesus up in his arms, and cried out, and said:
* Verily Thou art a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the Glory of thy people~
Israel.
V. When His parents brought in the Child Jesus, then took he Him up in his arms,~
and blessed God, and said:
R. Verily Thou art a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the Glory of thy people~
Israel.

[Lectio8]
Well is he called just, who looked not for favour for himself, but for~
consolation for his people. He desired to be set free from the bondage of this~
frail body, but he waited to see the Promised One for he knew that blessed are~
the eyes that see Him. Then took he Him up in his arms, and blessed God, and~
said Lord, now lettest Thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy~
word. Behold a just man, confined in the weary prison of the body, desiring to~
be dissolved and to begin to be with Christ. For to be dissolved and to be with~
Christ is much better. (Phil. i. 23.)

[Responsory8]
R. The old man bore the Child, but the Child was the old man's King;
* Even that Child Whom a virgin bore, and remained a virgin as before; and when~
that virgin had brought Him into the world, she fell down and worshipped Him.
V. Simeon took the Child up in his arms, and gave thanks, and blessed the Lord.
R. Even that Child Whom a virgin bore, and remained a virgin as before; and when~
that virgin had brought Him into the world, she fell down and worshipped Him.
&Gloria
R. Even that Child Whom a virgin bore, and remained a virgin as before; and when~
that virgin had brought Him into the world, she fell down and worshipped Him.

[Lectio9]
Whosoever will be dissolved and be with Christ, let him come into the Temple,~
let him come to Jerusalem, let him wait for the Lord's Christ, let him take hold~
on the Word of God, let him embrace it with good works, as it were with arms of~
faith and then let him depart in peace, for he shall not see death, who hath~
seen life. Behold how the Lord's Birth doth overflow with abounding grace for~
all, and prophecy is not denied to the just, but to the unbelieving. Behold,~
Simeon prophesieth that the Lord Jesus Christ is come for the fall and rising~
again of many yea, He shall separate the just from the unjust by their deserts,~
and according as our work shall be, so shall the true and righteous Judge~
command us to be punished or rewarded.
