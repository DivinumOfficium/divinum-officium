From the holy Gospel according to John
!John 8:1-11
In that time Jesus went unto mount Olivet. And early in the morning he~
came again into the temple And so on.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!33rd Tract on John.
Jesus went unto the Mount of Olives  even unto that fruitful Mount, that~
anointing Mount, that Mount of Chrism. Where else became it Christ to teach if~
not on the Mount of Olives? For the word Christ is derived from Chrisma, and~
Chrisma is the Greek for ointment. He hath anointed us that we may be able to~
wrestle with the devil. And, early in the morning, He came again into the~
temple; and all the people came unto Him; and He sat down, and taught them  and~
no man laid hands on Him, because He was not yet pleased to suffer. And now~
listen how His enemies tried the Lord's meekness.

And the Scribes and Pharisees brought unto Him a woman taken in adultery; and~
when they had set her in the midst, they say unto Him Master, this woman was~
taken in adultery, in the very act. Now, Moses in the law commanded that such~
should be stoned; but what sayest Thou? This they said, tempting Him, that they~
might have to accuse Him. Whereof to accuse Him? Had they taken Him in any sin?~
Or was the woman said to have anything to do with Him?

We must understand, my brethren, that there was a wonderful gentleness in the~
Lord. They knew that He was most mild and most gentle. Of Him indeed it had been~
said of old time Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most Mighty! In thy~
comeliness and thy beauty go forward, fare prosperously, and reign, because of~
truth, and meekness, and righteousness. (Ps. xliv. 4, 5.) And He came bringing~
truth as one that teacheth, meekness as one that delivereth, and righteousness~
as one that knoweth. Because of these it was that the Prophet declared, in the~
Holy Ghost, that He was to reign. Whenever He spake, truth shone forth~
whenever He spared His enemies, meekness was made glorious. And His enemies,~
racked with envy and hatred by His truth and His meekness, laid a~
stumbling-block for His righteousness.

Jesus stooped down, * and wrote on the ground He that is without sin, let him~
cast a stone at her.

[Oratio 2]
O Almighty God, grant, we beseech thee, that as many as, to afflict the body, do~
abstain from meats, may, by following after righteousness, fast from sin.

v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 8:1-11
8:1 AND Jesus went unto mount Olivet.
8:2 And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him, and sitting down he taught them.
8:3 And the scribes and the Pharisees bring unto him a woman taken in adultery: and they set her in the midst,
8:4 And said to him: Master, this woman was even now taken in adultery.
8:5 Now Moses in the law commanded us to stone such a one. But what sayest thou?
8:6 And this they said tempting him, that they might accuse him. But Jesus bowing himself down, wrote with his finger on the ground.
8:7 When therefore they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said to them: He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.
8:8 And again stooping down, he wrote on the ground.
8:9 But they hearing this, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest. And Jesus alone remained, and the woman standing in the midst.
8:10 Then Jesus lifting up himself, said to her: Woman, where are they that accused thee? Hath no man condemned thee?
8:11 Who said: No man, Lord. And Jesus said: Neither will I condemn thee. Go, and now sin no more.
