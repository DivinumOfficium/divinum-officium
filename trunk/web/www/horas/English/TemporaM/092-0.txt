Fron the book of Job
!Job 9:1-5
1 And Job answered, and said:
2 Indeed I know it is so, and that man cannot be justified compared with
3 If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one for a thousand.
4 He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath resisted him, and hath~
had peace
5 Who hath removed mountains, and they whom he overthrew in his wrath, knew it~
not.

!Job 9:6-10
6 Who shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.
7 Who commandeth tile sun and it riseth not: and shutteth up the stars as it~
were under a seal:
8 Who alone spreadeth out the heavens, and walketh upon the waves of the sea.
9 Who maketh Arcturus, and Orion, and Hyades, and the inner parts of the south.
10 Who doth things great and incomprehensible, and wonderful, of which there is~
no number.

!Job 9:11-17
11 If he come to me, I shall not see him: if he depart I shall not understand.
12 If he examine on a sudden, who shall answer him? or who can say: Why dost~
thou so?
13 God, whose wrath no mall can resist, and under whom they stoop that bear up~
the world.
14 What am I then, that I should answer him, and have words with him?
15 I, who although I should have any just thing, would not answer, but would~
make supplication to my judge.
16 And if he should hear me when I call, I should not believe that he had heard~
my voice.
17 For he shall crush me in a whirlwind, and multiply my wounds even without~
cause.

From the Book of Moral (Reflections upon Job) written by Pope St Gregory (the~
Great.)
!Bk. ix. ch. 2.
We know that it is so of a truth, and that a man cannot be justified as against~
God. When God is put out of the consideration, a man may be considered to be~
just, but considered as against God, his righteousness vanisheth away. When a~
man measureth himself by his relation to Him, Who is the Author of all good, he~
doth thereby acknowledge that of himself he hath no good in him, but hath~
received from God whatsoever he hath. He that glorifieth himself because of good~
which hath been given him, fighteth against God with God's own gifts. It is just~
therefore that the grounds upon which he ought to have been humbled, but upon~
which he hath puffed himself up, should be used to humble his vain-glory. But an~
holy man, because he perceiveth that the worth of our own good deeds falleth~
short, when he considereth his own spiritual man, justly saith If He will~
contend with him, he cannot answer Him one of a thousand.

In the Holy Scriptures the numeral a thousand is used to be taken as signifying a~
generalization. Thus, the Psalmist saith The word which He commanded to a~
thousand generations (Ps. civ. 8), whereas it is notorious that the Evangelist~
doth not reckon more then seventy-and-seven generations between the very~
beginning of the world and the coming of our Redeemer. What therefore is to be~
understood here by a thousand The general ripeness of the old generation to~
bring forth a new offspring. Hence also it is said by John And shall reign~
with Him a thousand years (Apoc. xx. 6,) because the reign of the Holy Church~
will be over all mankind made perfect.

When times one is ten, and ten times ten is an hundred, and ten times an hundred~
is a thousand. Observing therefore this connection between one and a thousand,~
what are we to understand by the one (in the text, connected as it is with the~
thousand whereby we understand perfection)? Is it not the beginning of a good~
life, even as the thousand representeth perfection? The contending with God~
~(which is spoken of in the text) is the nonacknowledgment of that which is owed~
to Him, and the vain-glorying instead in our own strength. But an holy man~
should see, that even if one had received the gifts of perfection, and were to~
make them the grounds of self-glorifying, such an one would thereby lose all~
that he had received.
