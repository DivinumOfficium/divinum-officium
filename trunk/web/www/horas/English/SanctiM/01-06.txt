[Hymnus Vespera]
v. Why, impious Herod, vainly fear
That Christ the Saviour cometh here?
He takes no earthly realms away
Who gives the crown that lasts for aye.
_
To greet His birth the Wise Men went,
Led by the star before them sent;
Called on by light, towards light they pressed,
And by their gifts their God confessed.
_
In holy Jordan's purest wave
The heavenly Lamb vouchsafed to lave;
That He, to whom was sin unknown,
Might cleanse His people from their own.
_
New miracle of power divine!
The water reddens into wine:
He spake the word: and poured the wave
In other streams than nature gave.
_
All glory, Lord, to thee we pay
For thine Epiphany to-day:
All glory, as is ever meet,
To Father and to Paraclete.
Amen.

Lesson from the book of Isaias
!Isa 55:1-4
1 ALL you that thirst, come to the waters: and you that have no money make haste,~
buy, and eat: come ye, buy wine and milk without money, and without any price.
2 Why do you spend money for that which is not bread, and your labour for that~
which doth not satisfy you? Hearken diligently to me, and eat that which is good,~
and your soul shall be delighted in fatness.
3 Incline your ear and come to me: hear and your soul shall live, and I will~
make an everlasting covenant with you, the faithful mercies of David.
4 Behold I have given him for a witness to the people, for a leader and a master~
to the Gentiles.

[Responsory11]
R. This day, when the Lord was baptized in Jordan, the heavens were opened, and~

V. The Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon Him, and a voice~

From the Sermons of Pope St Leo (the Great)
!2nd for Twelfth-Day.
Dearly beloved brethren, rejoice in the Lord; again I say, rejoice. But a few~
days are past since the solemnity of Christ's Birth, and now the glorious light~
of His Manifestation is breaking upon us. On that day the Virgin brought Him~
forth, and on this the world knew Him. The Word made Flesh was pleased to reveal~
Himself by degrees to those for whom He had come. When Jesus was born He was~
manifested indeed to the believing, but hidden from His enemies. Already indeed~
the heavens declared the glory of God, and their sound went out into all lands,~
when the Herald Angels appeared to tell to the shepherds the glad tidings of a~
Saviour's Birth; and now the guiding star leadeth the wise men to worship Him,~
that from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the Birth of the true~
King may be known abroad; that through those wise men the kingdoms of the east~
might learn the great truth, and the Roman empire remain no more in darkness.

[Responsory4]
R. Shine, shine, O Jerusalem, for thy light is come
* And the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.
V. And the Gentiles shall walk in thy light, and kings in the brightness of thy~
rising.
R. And the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.

[Lectio5]
The very cruelty of Herod, when he strove to crush at His birth this King Whom~
he alone feared, was made a blind means to carry out this dispensation of mercy.~
While the tyrant with horrid guilt sought to slay the little Child he did not~
know, amid an indiscriminate slaughter of innocents, his infamous act served to~
spread wider abroad the heaven-told news of the Birth of the Lord. Thus were~
these glad tidings loudly proclaimed, both by the novelty of their story, and~
the iniquity of their enemies. Then was the Saviour borne into Egypt, that that~
nation, of a long time hardened in idolatry, might by the mysterious virtue~
which went out of Him, even when His presence was unknown, be prepared for the~
saving light so soon to dawn on them, and might receive the Truth as a wanderer~
even before they had banished falsehood.

[Responsory5]
R. All they from Saba shall come, they shall bring gold and incense, and they~
shall show forth the praises of the Lord.
* Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
V. The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents, the kings of~
Arabia and Saba shall offer gifts.
R. Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.

[Lectio6]
Dearly beloved brethren, we recognise in the wise men who came to worship Christ,~
the first-fruits of that dispensation to the Gentiles wherein we also are called~
and enlightened. Let us then keep this Feast with grateful hearts, in~
thanksgiving for our blessed hope, whereof it doth commemorate the dawn. From~
that worship paid to the new-born Christ is to be dated the entry of us Gentiles~
upon our heirship of God and co-heirship with Christ. Since that joyful day the~
Scriptures which testify of Christ have lain open for us as well as for the~
Jews. Yea, their blindness rejected that Truth, Which, since that day, hath shed~
Its bright beams upon all nations. Let all observance, then, be paid to this~
most sacred day, whereon the Author of our salvation was made manifest, and as~
the wise men fell down and worshipped Him in the manger, so let us fall down and~
worship Him enthroned Almighty in heaven. As they also opened their treasures~
and presented unto Him mystic and symbolic gifts, so let us strive to open our~
hearts to Him, and offer Him from thence some worthy offering.

[Responsory6]
R. There came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, asking and saying Where is He~
That is born King of the Jews? for we have seen His star in the east
* And are come to worship the Lord.
V. We have seen His star in the east.
R. And are come to worship the Lord.
&Gloria
R. And are come to worship the Lord.

[Ant7 Matutinum]
O come, let us worship Him for He is the Lord our God.;;94

From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 2:1-12
When Jesus therefore was born in Bethlehem of Juda, in the days of king Herod,~
behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem. Saying, Where is he that~
is born king of the Jews? And so on.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great.)
!10th on the Gospels.
Dearly beloved brethren, hear ye from the Gospel lesson how, when the King of~
heaven was born, the king of earth was troubled? The heights of heaven are~
opened and the depths of earth are stirred. Let us now consider the question,~
why, when the Redeemer was born, an angel brought the news to the shepherds of~
Judea, but a star led the wise men of the East to worship Him. It seemeth as if~
the Jews as reasonable creatures received a revelation from a reasonable being,~
that is, an angel, but the Gentiles without, being as brutes, are roused not by a~
voice, but by a sign, that is, a star. Hence Paul hath it: a sign, not to them~
that believe, but to them that believe not but prophesying serveth not for them~
that believe not, but for them which believe. (1 Cor. xiv. 22.) So the~
prophesying, that is, of the angel was given to them that believed, and the sign~
to them that believed not.

[Responsory7]
R. The star which the wise men had seen in the East, went before them, till they~
came where the young Child was.
* And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
V. And when they were come into the house, they found the young Child with Mary~
His Mother, and fell down and worshipped Him.
R. And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.

[Lectio8]
Thus also we remark that afterwards the Redeemer was preached among the Gentiles~
not by Himself, but by His Apostles, even as, when a little Child, He is shown~
to them, not by the voice of angels, but merely by the vision of a star. When He~
Himself had begun to speak He was made known to us by speakers, but when He lay~
silent in the manger, by that silent testimony in heaven. But whether we~
consider the signs which accompanied His birth or His death, this thing is~
wonderful, namely, the hardness of heart of the Jews, who would not believe in~
Him either for prophesying or for miracles.

[Responsory8]
R. When the wise men saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
* And when they were come into the house, they found the young Child with Mary~
His Mother, and fell down and worshipped Him; and when they had opened their~
treasures, they presented unto Him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.
V. The star which the wise men had seen in the East, went before them, till it~
came and stood over where the young Child was.
R. And when they were come into the house, they found the young Child with Mary~
His Mother, and fell down and worshipped Him.
&Gloria
R. And when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto Him gifts; gold,~
and frankincense, and myrrh.

[Lectio9]
All things which He had made, bore witness that their Maker was come. Let me~
reckon them after the manner of men. The heavens knew that He was God, and sent a~
star to shine over where He lay. The sea knew it, and bore Him up when He walked~
upon it. The earth knew it, and quaked when He died. The sun knew it, and was~
darkened. The rocks and walls knew it, and rent at the hour of His death. Hell~
knew it, and gave up the dead that were in it. And yet up to this very hour the~
hearts of the unbelieving Jews will not acknowledge that He to Whom all nature~
testified is their God, and, being more hardened than the rocks, refuse to be~
rent by repentance.
&teDeum

[Responsory9]
R. This is the great day in which the Savior of the world appeared, whom the Prophets foretold, the Angels announced.

R. At whose star the Magi rejoiced, and offered Him gifts.

Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 2:1-12
2:1 WHEN Jesus therefore was born in Bethlehem of Juda, in the days of king Herod, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem.
2:2 Saying, Where is he that is born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east, and are come to adore him.
2:3 And king Herod hearing this, was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
2:4 And assembling together all the chief priests and the scribes of the people, he inquired of them where Christ should be born.
2:5 But they said to him: In Bethlehem of Juda. For so it is written by the prophet:
2:6 And thou Bethlehem the land of Juda art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come forth the captain that shall rule my people Israel.
2:7 Then Herod, privately calling the wise men, learned diligently of them the time of the star which appeared to them;
2:8 And sending them into Bethlehem, said: Go and diligently inquire after the child, and when you have found him, bring me word again, that I also may come to adore him.
2:9 Who having heard the king, went their way; and behold the star which they had seen in the east, went before them, until it came and stood over where the child was.
2:10 And seeing the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
2:11 And entering into the house, they found the child with Mary his mother, and falling down they adored him; and opening their treasures, they offered him gifts; gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
2:12 And having received an answer in sleep that they should not return to Herod, they went back another way into their country.
