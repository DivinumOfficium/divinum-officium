This programlet is my own work, and does not represent any official order,
neither the view or opinion of any group. I tried to follow my sources, 
but naturaly the more I work on this project the more mistakes I make.
Such a project can be done only by teamwork. I keep doing this in the hope,
that a team will pick up the idea, and will use the computers in entirety
to help worship God.<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR=red><B><I>Word of caution:</I></B></FONT><BR><BR>

<B>Those who are obliged to recite the office should do so from canonically 
approved books. (Can 276.2.3), and according to the Summorum Pontificium
only the 1962 books are accepted as extraordinary form. 

I make every effort to make in this website the <I>Rubrics 1960</I> version to be identical
with the 1962 typical edition, but this internet text is not approved as so.</B><BR><BR>

<UL>
<LI>Also I have written sources for the <I>Divino Afflatu</I> and <I>Trident 1910</I> 
and <I>Trident 1570</I> versions, which I follow carefully as much as possible
<LI>The <I>pre Trident monastic</I> version is projection backward 
<LI>The <I>Reduced 1955</I> version never existed in printed form 
<LI>The <1960 Newcalendar> version is projection forward ,and with some probability
disapproved by the Ecclesia Dei Commission January 20 2010 (Prot 13/2007) decision accepted
form of the Liturgy.

<H1 ALIGN CENTER>Historical versions of the Divinum Officium</H1>

The Divinum Officium was the official prayer of the Roman Catholic Church for
at least 1500 years, until 1971, when it was significantly changed to 
<B>The Liturgy of the Hours</B>. This programlet is partially a device for 
me to pray the Office easily, and partially a historical document to 
visually show the changes in the last few hundred years. This project 
shows how the daily Office was collected from the same psalms, lections, hymns, 
versicles and responsories for the different versions.:<BR><BR>

<UL>
<LI>The <B>pre Tridentine Monastic</B> version is an attempt to illustrate the 
Benedictine Breviary, as it is described in the <A HREF="http://www.osb.org/rb/" TARGET=_NEW>
Regula of St Benedict</A>, with the exception that for lack of resources only 9 lessons
are included for Sundays and Feasts instead of 12 lesson
<FONT SIZE=1>See details <A HREF=#monastic>below</A></FONT><BR><BR>

<LI>The version ordered after the <B>Council of Trent</B>, by Pope St. Pius V,
which except for the ever increasing number of feasts in the Proprium Sanctorum was 
unchanged until the 20th Century. This Tridentine version was based on the many 
centuries  before printed books, therefore the  majority of psalms were prayed in Mattins, 
Lauds, and Vespers. The little hours contained the same psalm 118 everyday, which was memorized 
by heart and could be prayed without a book, at the little hours. Sunday Matutinum contained 
18 psalms, and the weekday mattins contained 12 psalms. Lauds and Vespers were considerably 
longer, due to the length of of the psalm and their suffragia. The Feasts of Saints offered 
some relief in the number of psalms. Those Mattins consisted of 9 psalms only which broke the 
rule of the required 150 psalms a week. The number of Festive Offices came to exceed 
the number of ferial Sunday Offices, when more than two thirds of the days were Festive 
Offices.<BR><BR>

The <B>Trident 1570</B> version uses the original 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tridentine_Calendar" TARGET=_NEW>
1570 calendar</A>, the <B>Trident 1910</B> version uses the permanent calendar from the 
<A HREF="http://www.archive.org/details/p1breviariumroma00cathuoft" TARGET=_NEW>
1888 Pustet</A> edition Hiemalis volume. The two differ only in the calendars, 
both uses the Clementine psalter and hymns, as well as the same rubrics. 
<FONT SIZE=1>See details <A HREF=#trident>below</A></FONT><BR><BR>


<LI>The <span class=prma>Divino Afflatu</span> version is named from the 
<A HREF="http://sanctaliturgia.blogspot.com/2005/11/divino-afflatu-english.html" TARGET=_NEW> 
Encyclical</A> of St. Pius X., and was the Official version from 1911 to 1960. St Pius X. mixed 
two changes  
<UL><LI> The version uses the ferial psalms for the festive offices except for the 
1st and 2nd class feasts, and for a few others which antiphons hand down for a feast. <FONT SIZE=1>
The <B><I>Trindent version Sesonal mode</I></B> is an attempt to show the effect of this change 
without the change of the Psalter</FONT>
<LI> Also psalms are divided into a weekly cycle without significant repetion 
of the psalms (9 psalms for matins, 5 each for the major hours, 3 each for the minor
hours). The encyclical also shortened significantly the suffragia, and other parts of the office,
reducing the time at prayer about 20%. </UL><BR>
The Divino Afflatu version uses the permanent Kalendar from the printed <B>1943 Ratisbone Pustet</B> 
edition Hiemalis volume.  
<A HREF=http://divinumofficium.com/www/horas/Help/Missing%20Offices.html" TARGET=_NEW>
Missing offices</A> are updated as sources allows.
<BR><BR>

<LI>The version <span class=prma>Reduced 1955</span> based on 
<A HREF="http://rubricsandritual.blogspot.com/2008/03/cum-nostra-hac-aetate.html" TARGET=_NEW>
Cum Nostra Hac aetate</A> decree, and the version 
<span class=prma>Rubrics 1960</span> ordered by the Motu Proprio 
<A HREF="http://divinumofficium.com/www/horas/Help/Rubrics/Rubricarum%20Instructum.html" TARGET=_NEW>
Rubricarum Instructum 1960</A> 
of John XXIII.  furter shortened the prayer time by and additional 5% and 15% respectively. <BR><BR>
Both versions are using the permanent calendar from David Siefker's  
<A HREF="http://stores.lulu.com/breviary" TARGET="_new">Lulu Breviary</A>.
Missing offices are updated as sources allows.<BR>
<FONT SIZE=1>See details <A HREF=#1960>below</A></FONT><BR><BR>


The <B>1960 New Calendar</B> version implements the 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_calendar_of_saints" TARGET=_NEW>
2009 permanent calendar</A>. It uses the 1960 rubrics, which is now the
<A HREF="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_ben-xvi_motu-proprio_20070707_summorum-pontificum_lt.html" TARGET=_NEW>
extraordinary form</A> of the office. It is an experiment of the idea, that this form should 
be living prayer of the Church.<BR>
<FONT SIZE=1>See details <A HREF=#new>below</A></FONT><BR><BR>

</UL><BR>

I pray the The Divino Afflatu version but the main point of this project 
is to show the changes published 1955, and 1960 are not more than the changes which were 
made in 1911  by Divino Afflatu. In all changes the reason was to simplify and shorten
the office.

slightly different set for holy men and holy women, with the Sunday's psalms  from the

<A Name=new>
<B>1960 New Calendar version changes</B>:<BR>
<UL>
<LI> implementing the 2009 Calendar  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_calendar_of_saints) Only those offices are parts of the office for Proper of Saints, which are listed here; some offices are relocated. Offices not found in the Extraordinary form, are created from the Common of Saints
<LI> Memorial offices are implemented as 3rd class offices according to the 1960 rubrics (1, 2-3 readings from the season, 3rd reading from the saint). Feasts are implemented as 2nd class (semifestive offices), solemnities as 1st class (festive) offices
<LI> optional memorial  offices are prayed in 'regular' mode, the ferial office is used in 'seasonal' mode, except for Advent, when always the ferial office is recited if the saint's office is optional
<LI> in Lent all memorial offices are trumped by the ferial office, in accordance to the 1960 rubrics (there is only Gospel homily, no Scriptural reading for the season)
<LI> if two saints are assigned for the same day, the first in the calendar is chosen
<LI> commemoration of a saint would be implemented only for local Feast or Solemnity in the O antiphon (Dec 17-24) days in Advent
<LI> Seasonal feast days moved to Sundays (Ascencion etc) cannot be handled, there would be no office left for the feria. Feasts days of saints can be moved through the translation table (Latin/Psalterium/Trnewcal.txt, Latin/Psalterium/Trnewcalyyyy.txt)
<LI> Ember days, Rogation days, and the Octave of Pentecost is dropped following the previous trend since 1955; however the lessons are Gospel homilies for that days
<LI> The traditional schema of Sundays (Septuagesima time, 6 Sundays after Epiphany and 24 Sundays after Pentecost) is not changed because any change of this would require to create a new scriptural reading schema
