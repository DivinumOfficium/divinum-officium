!!Gospel
Continuation ++ of the holy Gospel according to Matthew.
R. Glory be to Thee, O Lord.
!Matt 21:1-9
At that time, when Jesus drew nigh to Jerusalem, and was come to Bethphage, unto Mount Olivet, then He sent two disciples, saying to them: Go ye into the village that is over against you, and immediately you shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them and bring them to Me.  And if any man shall say anything to you, say ye, that the Lord hath need of them: and forthwith he will let them go.  Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: Tell ye the daughter of Sion: Behold thy King cometh to thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of her that is used to the yoke.  And the disciples going, did as Jesus commanded them.  And they brought the ass and the colt, and laid their garments upon them, and made him sit thereon.  And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way: and others cut boughs from the trees, and strewed them in the way, and the multitudes that went before and that followed, cried, saying: Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord.
R. Praise be to Thee, O Christ.
S. By the words of the Gospel may our sins be blotted out.

!!The Procession of Palms
! The procession now takes place.  When the priest places incense in the thurible, the deacon, turning toward the people, sings, the choir responding:
V. Let us go forth in peace.
R. In the name of Christ. Amen.
! The thurifer precedes with the smoking censer, followed by the subdeacon, bearing the processional cross between two acolytes carrying lighted candles.  Then follow the clergy in order of rank, then the celebrant with the deacon on his left.  Where it is custom for the people to join the procession, they follow the celebrant.  All carry palms, and all or some of them sing the following anthems, hymns, and Psalms, during the whole time the procession lasts.
_
v. The multitude goeth forth to meet our Redeemer with flowers and palms, and payeth the homage due to a triumphant Conqueror: the Gentiles proclaim the Son of God; and their voices thunder through the skies in praise of Christ: Hosanna in the highest!

He shall send out His Word and shall melt them: * His wind shall blow and the waters shall run.
Who declareth His word to Jacob: * His justice and His judgements to Israel.
He hath not done in like manner to every nation: * and His judgements He hath not made manifest to them.

$Per eumdem

[Lectio]
Lesson
!Phil 2:5 - 11.
Brethren: Have this in mind in you which was also in Christ Jesus, Who, though He was by nature God, did not consider being equal to God a thing to be clung to, but emptied Himself, taking the nature of a slave and being made like unto men. And appearing in the form of man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient to death, even to death on a cross. Therefore God also has exalted Him and has bestowed upon Him the Name that is above every name, (Kneel) so that at the Name of Jesus every knee should bend of those in heaven, on earth and under the earth and every tongue should confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the Father.

[Graduale]
!Ps 72:24, 1 - 3.
You have hold of my right hand; with Your counsel You guide me; and in the end You will receive me in glory.
V. How good God is to Israel, to those who are clean of heart! But, as for me, I almost lost my balance; my feet all but slipped, because I was envious of sinners when I saw them prosper though they were wicked.
_
!Tractus
!Ps 21:2 - 9, 18 - 19, 22, 24, 32.
My God, my God, look upon me: why have You forsaken me?
V. Far from my salvation, are the words of my sins.
V. O my God, I cry out by day and You answer not; by night, and there is no relief.
V. But You are enthroned in the holy place, O glory of Israel!
V. In You our fathers trusted; they trusted and You delivered them.
V. To You they cried, and they escaped; in You they trusted, and they were not put to shame.
V. But I am a worm, not a man; the scorn of men, despised by the people.
V. All who see me, scoff at me; they mock me with parted lips, they wag their heads.
V. He relied on the Lord; let Him deliver him, let Him rescue him, if He loves him.”
V. But they look on and gloat over me; they divide my garments among them, and for my vesture they cast lots.
V. Save me from the lion’s mouth; from the horns of the wild bulls, my wretched life.
V. You who fear the Lord, praise Him: all you descendants of Jacob, give glory to Him.
V. There shall be declared to the Lord a generation to come: and the heavens shall show forth His justice.
V. To a people that shall be born, which the Lord has made.

[Evangelium]
THE PASSION OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
!Matthew 26:1-75; 27:1-66.
At that time Jesus said to His disciples: J. You know that after two days shall be the Pasch, and the Son of Man shall be delivered up to be crucified. C. Then were gathered together the chief priests and ancients of the people, into the court of the high priest, who was called Caiphas; and they consulted together, that by subtlety they might apprehend Jesus, and put Him to death. But they said: S. Not on the festival day, lest perhaps there should be a tumult among the people. C. And when Jesus was in Bethania, in the house of Simon the leper, there came to Him a woman having an alabaster box of precious ointment and poured it on His head as He was at table. And the disciples seeing it had indignation, saying: S. To what purpose is this waste? For this might have been sold for much and given to the poor. C. And Jesus knowing it, said to them: J. Why do you trouble this woman? For she hath wrought a good work upon Me. For the poor you have always with you; but Me you have not always. For she, in pouring this ointment upon My Body, hath done it for My burial. Amen I say to you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which she hath done shall be told for a memory of her. C. Then went one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, to the chief priests, and he said to them: S. What will you give me; and I will deliver Him unto you? C. But they appointed him thirty pieces of silver. And from thenceforth he sought opportunity to betray Him.  And on the first day of the Azymes the disciples came to Jesus, saying: S.Where wilt Thou that we prepare for Thee to eat the pasch? C. But Jesus said: J. Go ye into the city to a certain man, and say to him: The master saith, My time is near at hand, with thee I make the pasch with My disciples. C. And the disciples did as Jesus appointed to them; and they prepared the pasch. But when it was evening, He sat down with His twelve disciples; and whilst they were eating, He said: J. Amen I say to you that one of you is about to betray Me. C. And they, being very much troubled, began every one to say: S. Is it I, Lord? C. But He answering, said: J. He that dippeth his hand with Me in the dish, he shall betray Me. The Son of Man indeed goeth, as it is written of Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man shall be betrayed; it were better for him, if that man had not been born. C. And Judas that betrayed Him, answering said: S. Is it I, Rabbi? C. He saith to him: J. Thou hast said it. C. And whilst they were at supper, Jesus took bread, and blessed and broke and gave to His disciples, and said: J. Take ye and eat; this is My Body. C. And taking the chalice, He gave thanks and gave to them, saying: J. Drink ye all of this. For this is My testament, which shall be shed for many unto the remission of sins. And I say to you, I will not drink from henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when I shall drink it with you new in the kingdom of My Father. C. And a hymn being said, they went out unto Mount Olivet. Then Jesus saith to them: J. All you shall be scandalized in Me this night; for it is written: I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be dispersed; but after I shall be risen again, I will go before you into Galilee. C. And Peter, answering, said to Him: S. Although all shall be scandalized in Thee, I will never be scandalized. C. Jesus said to him: J. Amen I say to thee, that in this night, before the cock crow, thou wilt deny Me thrice. C. Peter saith to Him: S. Yea, though I should die with Thee, I will not deny Thee. C. And in like manner said all the disciples.  Then Jesus came with them into a country place which is called Gethsemani; and He said to His disciples: J. Sit you here, till I go yonder and pray. C. And taking with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, He began to grow sorrowful and to be sad. Then He saith to them: J. My soul is sorrowful even unto death; stay you here and watch with Me. C. And going a little further, He fell upon His face, praying and saying: J. My Father, if it be possible, let this chalice pass from Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as Thou wilt. C. And He cometh to His disciples, and findeth them asleep. And He saith to Peter: J. What! Could you not watch one hour with Me? Watch ye, and pray that ye enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. C. Again the second time, He went and prayed, saying: J. My Father, if this chalice may not pass away, but I must drink it, Thy will be done. C. And He cometh again, and findeth them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. And leaving them, He went again and He prayed the third time, saying the self-same word. Then He cometh to His disciples, and saith to them: J. Sleep ye now and take your rest; behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise, let us go; behold, he is at hand that will betray Me.  C. As He yet spoke, behold Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the ancients of the people. And he that betrayed Him gave them a sign, saying: S. Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is He; hold Him fast. C. And forthwith coming to Jesus, he said: S. Hail, Rabbi. C. And he kissed Him. And Jesus said to him: J. Friend, whereto art thou come? C. Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus, and held Him. And behold one of them that were with Jesus, stretching forth his hand, drew out his sword, and striking the servant of the high priest, cut off his ear. Then Jesus saith to him: J. Put up again thy sword into its place; for all that take the sword shall perish with the sword. Thinkest thou that I cannot ask My Father, and He will give Me presently more than twelve legions of Angels? How then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that so it must be done? C. In that same hour Jesus said to the multitudes: J. You are come out, as it were to a robber, with swords and clubs to apprehend Me. I sat daily with you, teaching in the temple, and you laid not hands on Me. C. Now all this was done that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then the disciples, all leaving Him, fled.  But they holding Jesus led Him to Caiphas the high priest, where the scribes and the ancients were assembled. And Peter followed Him afar off, even to the court of the high priest. And going in, he sat with the servants, that he might see the end. And the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against Jesus, that they might put Him to death. And they found none, whereas many false witnesses had come in. And last of all there came two false witnesses; and they said: This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and after three days to rebuild it. And the high priest, rising up, said to Him: S. Answerest Thou nothing to the things which these witness against Thee? C. But Jesus held His peace. And the high priest said to Him: S. I adjure Thee by the living God, that Thou tell us if Thou be the Christ the Son of God. C. Jesus saith to him: J. Thou hast said it. Nevertheless I say to you, hereafter you shall see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the power of God, and coming in the clouds of heaven. C. Then the high priest rent his garments, saying: S. He hath blasphemed; what further need have we of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard the blasphemy. What think you? C. But they answering, said: S. He is guilty of death. C. Then they did spit in His face and buffeted Him; and others struck His face with the palms of their hands, saying: S. Prophesy unto us, O Christ, who is he that struck Thee?  C. But Peter sat without in the court, and there came to him a servant maid, saying: S. Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilean. C. But he denied it before them all, saying: S. I know not what thou sayest. C. And as he went out of the gate, another maid saw him, and she saith to them that were there: S. This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth. C. And again he denied it with an oath: S. I know not the man. C. And after a little while, they came that stood by and said to Peter: S. Surely thou also art one of them; for even thy speech doth discover thee. C. Then he began to curse and to swear that he knew not the man; and immediately the cock crew. And Peter remembered the words of Jesus which He had said: before the cock crow, thou wilt deny Me thrice. And going forth, he wept bitterly. And when morning was come, all the chief priests and ancients ofthe people took counsel against Jesus, that they might put Him to death. And they brought Him bound, and delivered Him to Pontius Pilate the governor.  Then Judas, who betrayed Him, seeing that He was condemned, repenting himself, brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and ancients, saying: S. I have sinned in betraying innocent blood. C. But they said: S. What is that to us? Look thou to it. C. And casting down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed, and went and hanged himself with a halter. But the chief priests having taken the pieces of silver, said: S. It is not lawful to put them into the corbona, because it is the price of blood. And after they had consulted together, they bought with them the potter's field, to be a burying-place for strangers. For this cause that field was called Haceldama, that is, the field of blood, even to this day. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremias the prophet, saying: And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him that was prized, whom they prized of the children of Israel: and they gave them unto the potter's field, as the Lord appointed to me.  And Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked Him, saying: S.Art Thou the King of the Jews? C. Jesus saith to him: J. Thou sayest it. C. And when He was accused by the chief priests and ancients, He answered nothing. Then Pilate saith to Him: S. Dost not Thou hear how great testimonies they allege against Thee? C. And He answered to him never a word, so that the governor wondered exceedingly. Now upon the solemn day the governor was accustomed to release to the people one prisoner, whom they would. And he had then a notorious prisoner that was called Barabbas. They therefore being gathered together, Pilate said: S. Whom will you that I release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus that is called Christ? C. For he knew that for envy they had delivered Him. And as he was sitting in the place of judgment his wife sent to him, saying: S. Have thou nothing to do with that just man, for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of Him. C. But the chief priests and ancients persuaded the people that they should ask Barabbas, and make Jesus away. And the governor answering, said to them: S. Whither will you of the two to be released unto you? C. But they said: S. Barabbas. C. Pilate saith to them: S. What shall I do then with Jesus that is called Christ? C. They all call: S. Let Him be crucified. C. The governor said to them: S. Why, what evil hath He done? C. But they cried out the more, saying: S. Let Him be crucified. C. And Pilate seeing that he prevailed nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, taking water washed his hands before the people, saying: S. I am innocent of the blood of this just man; look you to it. C. And the whole people answering, said: S. His blood be upon us and upon our children. C. Then he released to them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered Him unto them to be crucified. Then the soldiers of the governor, taking Jesus into the hall, gathered together unto Him the whole band; and stripping Him they put a scarlet cloak about Him. And platting a crown of thorns they put it upon His head and a reed in His right hand. And bowing the knee before Him, they mocked Him, saying: S. Hail, King of the Jews. C. And spitting upon Him, they took the reed and struck His head. And after they had mocked Him, they took off the cloak from Him, and put on Him His own garments, and led Him away to crucify Him.  And going out, they found a man of Cyrene, named Simon; him they forced to take up His cross. And they came to the place that is called Golgotha, which is, the place of Calvary. And they gave Him wine to drink mingled with gall; and when He had tasted He would not drink. And after they had crucified Him, they divided His garments, casting lots; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: They divided My garments among them, and upon my vesture they cast lots. And they sat and watched Him. And they put over His head His cause written: This is Jesus the King of the Jews. Then were crucified with Him two thieves; one on the right hand and one on the left. And they that passed by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads, and saying: S. Vah, Thou that destroyest the temple of God and in three days dost rebuild it, save Thine own self. If Thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross. C. In like manner also the chief priests with the scribes and ancients, mocking, said: S. He saved others, Himself He cannot save; if He be the king of Israel, let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe Him; He trusted in God, let Him now deliver Him if He will have Him; for He said: I am the Son of God. C. And the self-same thing the thieves also that were crucified with Him reproached Him with. Now from the sixth hour there was a darkness over the whole earth, until the ninth hour.  And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying: J. Eli, Eli, lamma sabacthani? C. That is: J. My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me? C. And some that stood there and heard said: S. This man calleth Elias. C. And immediately one of them running took a sponge and filled it with vinegar and and gave Him to drink. And the others said: S. Let be; let us see whether Elias will come to deliver Him. C. And Jesus again crying with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.
!Here all kneel and pause for a few moments.
 And behold the veil of the temple was rent in two from top even to the bottom; and the earth quaked and the rocks were rent; and the graves were opened, and many bodies of the saints that had slept arose, and coming out of the tombs after His resurrection, came into the holy city, and appeared to many. Now the centurion and they that were with him watching Jesus, having seen the earthquake and the things that were done, were sore afraid, saying: S. Indeed this was the Son of God. C. And there were there many women afar off, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto Him: among whom was Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.  And when it was evening, there came a certain rich man of Arimathea, named Joseph, who also himself was a disciple of Jesus. He went to Pilate and asked the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded that the body should be delivered. And Joseph taking the body wrapt it up in a clean linen cloth, and laid it in his own new monument, which he had hewed out in a rock. And he rolled a great stone to the door of the monument and went his way. And there was Mary Magdalen and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.
_
v. Cleanse my heart and my lips, O almighty God, who didst cleanse the lips of the prophet Isaias with a burning coal, and vouchsafe, through Thy gracious mercy, so to purify me, that I may worthily announce Thy holy Gospel. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.
_
Give me Thy blessing, O Lord. The Lord be in my heart and on my lips, that I may worthily and in a becoming manner, proclaim His holy Gospel. Amen.
P. The Lord be with you.
S. And with thy spirit. 
v. And the next day, which followed the day of preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate, saying: Sir, we have remembered that that seducer said, while He was yet alive: After three days I will rise again. Command therefore the sepulchre to be guarded until the third day, lest perhaps His disciples come and steal Him away and say to the people: He is risen; and the last error shall be worse than the first. Pilate saith to them: You have a guard; go, guard it as you know. And they departing, make the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone and setting guards.

Insult has broken my heart, and I am weak; I looked for sympathy, but there was none; for comforters, and I found none. Rather they put gall in My food and in My thirst they gave Me vinegar to drink.

[Secreta]
Grant, we beseech You, almighty God, that the gift offered in the sight of Your majesty may obtain for us the grace of reverent devotion and assure us eternal happiness.
