[Oratio](rubrica 1960)
O God, the Strength of all them that put their trust in thee, mercifully accept~
our prayers, and because through the weakness of our mortal nature we can do no~
good thing without thee, grant us the help of thy grace, that in keeping of thy~
commandments we may please thee, both in will and deed.
