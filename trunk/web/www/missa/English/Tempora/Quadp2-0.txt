Lesson from the second letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians
!2 Cor. 11:19-33; 12:1-9
Brethren: You gladly put up with fools, because you are wise yourselves! For you suffer it if a man enslaves you, if a man devours you, if a man takes from you, if a man is arrogant, if a man slaps your face! I speak to my own shame, as though we had been weak. But wherein any man is bold - I am speaking foolishly - I also am bold. Are they Hebrews? So am I! Are they Israelites? So am I! Are they offspring of Abraham? So am I! Are they ministers of Christ? I - to speak as a fool - am more: in many more labors, in prisons more frequently, in lashes above measure, often exposed to death. From the Jews five times I received forty lashes less one. Thrice I was scourged, once I was stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I was adrift on the sea; in journeyings often, in perils from floods, in perils from robbers, in perils from my own nation, in perils from the Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils from false brethren; in labor and hardships, in many sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness. Besides those outer things, there is my daily pressing anxiety, the care of all the churches! Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to stumble, and I am not inflamed? If I must boast, I will boast of the things that concern my weakness. The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, Who is blessed forevermore, knows that I do not lie. In Damascus the governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of the Damascenes in order to arrest me, but I was lowered in a basket through a window in the wall, and escaped his hands. If I must boast - it is not indeed expedient to do so - but I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago - whether in the body I do not know, or out of the body I do not know, God knows - such a one was caught up to the third heaven. And I know such a man - whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows that he was caught up into paradise and heard secret words that man may not repeat. Of such a man I will boast; but of myself I will glory in nothing save in my infirmities. For if I do wish to boast, I shall not be foolish; for I shall be speaking the truth. But I forbear, lest any man should reckon me beyond what he sees in me or hears from me. And lest the greatness of the revelations should puff me up, there was given me a thorn for the flesh, a messenger of Satan, to buffet me. Concerning this I thrice besought the Lord that it might leave me. And He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for strength is made perfect in weakness. Gladly therefore I will glory in my infirmities, that the strength of Christ may dwell in me.

[Graduale]
!Ps 82:19; 82:14
Let the nations know that God is Your name; You alone are the Most High over all~
the earth.
V. O my God, make them like leaves in a whirlwind, like chaff before the wind.
!Ps 59:4, 6.
You have rocked the country, O Lord, and split it open.
V. Repair the cracks in it, for it is tottering.
V. That they may flee out of bowshot; that Your loved ones may escape.

[GradualeF]
!Ps 82:19; 82:14
Let the nations know that God is Your name; You alone are the Most High over all~
the earth.
V. O my God, make them like leaves in a whirlwind, like chaff before the wind.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 8:4-15
At that time, when a very great crowd was gathering together and men from every~
town were resorting to Jesus. He said in a parable: The sower went out to sow~
his seed. And as he sowed, some seed fell by the wayside and was trodden under~
foot, and the birds of the air ate it up. And other seed fell upon the rock, and~
as soon as it had sprung up it withered away, because it had no moisture. And~
other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it.~
And other seed fell upon good ground, and sprang up and yielded fruit a~
hundredfold. As He said these things He cried out, He who has ears to hear, let~
him hear! But His disciples then began to ask Him what this parable meant, He~
said to them, To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God, but~
to the rest in parables, that ‘Seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not~
understand.’ Now the parable is this: the seed is the word of God. And those by~
the wayside are they who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the~
word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved. Now those upon~
the rock are they who, when they have heard, receive the word with joy; and~
these have no root, but believe for a while, and in time of temptation fall~
away. And that which fell among the thorns, these are they who have heard, and~
as they go their way are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life,~
and their fruit does not ripen. But that upon good ground, these are they who,~
with a right and good heart, having heard the word, hold it fast, and bear fruit~
in patience.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 16:5-7
Make my steps steadfast in Your paths, that my feet may not falter. Incline Your~
ear to me; hear my word. Show Your wondrous kindness, O Lord, Savior of those~
who trust in You.

[Secreta]
May this sacrifice which we offer You, O Lord, ever give us new life and~
protection.

I will go in to the altar of God, the God of my gladness and joy.

[Postcommunio]
O almighty God, grant, we humbly beseech You, that those whom You refresh with~
Your sacrament may also worthily serve You in a way that is well pleasing to~
You.
