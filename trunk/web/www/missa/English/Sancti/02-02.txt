!! Benedictio Candelarum
! Finita Tertia, Sacerdos indutus Pluviali violaceo, vel sine Casula, cum Ministris similiter indutis, procedit ad benedicendum Candelas, in medio ante Altare vel ad cornu Epistolæ positas, et ipse, ibidem stans versus ad Altare, dicit manibus junctis in tono Orationis Missæ ferialis:
V. Dóminus vobíscum.
R. Et cum spíritu tuo.
v. Orémus. Domine sancte, Pater omnípotens, ætérne Deus, qui ómnia ex níhilo creásti, et jussu tuo per ópera apum hunc liquorem ad perfectionem cérei veníre fecísti: et qui hodiérna die petitiónem justi Simeónis implésti: te humíliter deprecámur; ut has candélas ad usus hóminum et sanitátem córporum et animárum, sive in terra sive in aquis, per invocatiónem tui sanctíssimi nóminis et per intercessiónem beátæ Maríæ semper Vírginis, cujus hódie festa devóte celebrántur, et per preces ómnium Sanctórum tuórum, bene + dícere et sancti + ficáre dignéris: et hujus plebis tuæ, quæ illas honorífice in mánibus desíderat portare teque cantando laudare, exáudias voces de coelo sancto tuo et de sede majestátis tuæ: et propítius sis ómnibus clamántibus ad te, quos redemísti pretióso Sánguine Fílii tui:
$Qui tecum.
_
_
v. Orémus. Omnípotens sempitérne Deus, qui hodiérna die Unigénitum tuum ulnis sancti Simeónis in templo sancto tuo suscipiéndum præsentásti: tuam súpplices deprecámur cleméntiam; ut has candélas, quas nos fámuli tui, in tui nóminis magnificéntiam suscipiéntes, gestáre cúpimus luce accénsas, bene + dícere et sancti + ficáre atque lúmine supérnæ benedictiónis accéndere dignéris: quaténus eas tibi Dómino, Deo nostro, offeréndo digni, et sancto igne dulcíssimæ caritátis tuæ succénsi, in templo sancto glóriæ tuæ repræsentári mereámur.
$Per eundem
_
_
v. Orémus. Dómine Jesu Christe, lux vera, quæ illúminas omnem hóminem veniéntem in hunc mundum: effúnde bene + dictiónem tuam super hos céreos, et sancti + fica eos lúmine grátiæ tuæ, et concéde propítius; ut, sicut hæc luminária igne visíbili accénsa noctúrnas depéllunt ténebras; ita corda nostra invisíbili igne, id est, Sancti Spíritus splendóre illustráta, ómnium vitiórum cæcitáte cáreant: ut, purgáto mentis óculo, ea cérnere póssimus, quæ tibi sunt plácita et nostræ salúti utília; quaténus post hujus saeculi caliginósa discrímina ad lucem indeficiéntem perveníre mereámur. Per te, Christe Jesu, Salvátor mundi, qui in Trinitáte perfécta vivis et regnas Deus, per ómnia saecula sæculórum.
R. Amen.
_
_
v. Orémus. Omnípotens sempitérne Deus, qui per Móysen fámulum tuum puríssimum ólei liquórem ad luminária ante conspéctum tuum júgiter concinnánda præparári jussísti: bene + dictiónis tuæ grátiam super hos céreos benígnus infúnde; quaténus sic adminístrent lumen extérius, ut, te donánte, lumen Spíritus tui nostris non desit méntibus intérius.
$Per Dominum eiusdem
_
_
v. Orémus. Dómine Jesu Christe, qui hodiérna die, in nostræ carnis substántia inter hómines appárens, a paréntibus in templo es præsentátus: quem Símeon venerábilis senex, lúmine Spíritus tui irradiátus, agnóvit, suscépit et benedíxit: præsta propítius; ut, ejúsdem Spíritus Sancti grátia illumináti atque edócti, te veráciter agnoscámus et fidéliter diligámus: Qui cum Deo Patre in unitáte ejúsdem Spíritus Sancti vivis et regnas Deus, per ómnia saecula sæculórum.
R. Amen.

! Finitis Orationibus, Celebrans ponit incensum in thuríbulum: deinde ter aspergit Candelas aqua benedícta, dicendo Antiphonam Aspérges me, sine cantu et sine Psalmo: et ter adolet incenso. Tum dignior ex Clero accedit ad Altare, et ab eo Celebrans accipit Candelam, non genuflectens nec osculans manum illius. Postea Celebrans stans in medio ante Altare versus ad populum, distríbuit Candelas, primum digniori, a quo ipse acceperat; deinde Diacono et Subdiacono paratis, et aliis Clericis singulatim per ordinem, ultimo laicis: omnibus genuflectentibus, Candelam et manum Celebrantis osculantibus, exceptis Prælatis, si adsint. Et cum inceperit distribuere Candelas, a Choro cantatur:
_
!Antiphona Luc 2:32.
Ant. Lumen ad revelatiónem géntium et glóriam plebis tuæ Israël.
!Luc 2:29-31.
v. Nunc dimíttis servum tuum, Dómine, secúndum verbum tuum in pace
! Deinde repetitur tota Antiphona “Lumen ad revelatiónem géntium” quæ similiter repetitur post quemlibet Versum.
Ant. Lumen ad revelatiónem géntium et glóriam plebis tuæ Israël.
v. Quia vidérunt óculi mei salutáre tuum. 
Ant. Lumen ad revelatiónem géntium et glóriam plebis tuæ Israël.
v. Quod parásti ante fáciem ómnium populorum. 
Ant. Lumen ad revelatiónem géntium et glóriam plebis tuæ Israël.
v. Glória Patri, et Fílio, et Spirítui Sancto. 
Ant. Lumen ad revelatiónem géntium et glóriam plebis tuæ Israël.
v. Sicut erat in princípio, et nunc, et semper, et in saecula sæculórum. Amen. 
Ant. Lumen ad revelatiónem géntium et glóriam plebis tuæ Israël.
_
_
! His expletis, cantatur:
!Antiph Ps 43:26.
Ant. Exsúrge, Dómine, ádjuva nos: et líbera nos propter nomen tuum.
!Ps 43:2.
Deus, áuribus nostris audívimus: patres nostri annuntiavérunt nobis.
&Gloria
Ant. Exsúrge, Dómine, ádjuva nos: et líbera nos propter nomen tuum.
_
_
! Deinde Sacerdos dicit:
v. Orémus.
! Et si fuerit post Septuagesimam, et non in die Dominica, Diaconus dicit:
V. Flectámus génua.
R. Leváte.
v. Exáudi, quaesumus, Dómine, plebem tuam: et, quæ extrinsécus ánnua tríbuis devotióne venerári, intérius asséqui grátiæ tuæ luce concéde. Per Christum, Dóminum nostrum.
R. Amen.
_
_
! Deinde fit Processio. Et primo Celebrans ponit incensum in thuribulum: postea Diaconus vertens se ad populum, dicit:
V. Procedámus in pace.
R. In nómine Christi. Amen.
! Præcedit Thuriferarius cum thuribulo fumiganti: deinde Subdiaconus paratus, deferens Crucem, medius inter duos Acolythos cum candelabris accensis: sequitur Clerus per ordinem, ultimo Celebrans cum Diacono a sinistris, omnes cum Candelis accensis in manibus: et cantantur Antiphonæ sequentes:
Ant. Adórna thálamum tuum, Sion, et súscipe Regem Christum: ampléctere Maríam, quæ est coeléstis porta: ipsa enim portat Regem glóriæ novi lúminis: subsístit Virgo, addúcens mánibus Fílium ante lucíferum génitum: quem accípiens Símeon in ulnas suas, prædicávit pópulis, Dóminum eum esse vitæ et mortis et Salvatórem mundi.
_
!Luc 2:26, 27 et 28-29.
Ant. Respónsum accépit Símeon a Spíritu Sancto, non visúrum se mortem, nisi vidéret Christum Dómini: et cum indúcerent Púerum in templum, accépit eum in ulnas suas, et benedíxit Deum, et dixit: Nunc dimíttis servum tuum, Dómine, in pace.
V. Cum indúcerent púerum Jesum parentes ejus, ut fácerent secúndum consuetúdinem legis pro eo, ipse accépit eum in ulnas suas. 
!Et ingrediendo Ecclesiam, cantatur:
V. Obtulérunt pro eo Dómino par túrturum, aut duos pullos columbárum: * Sicut scriptum est in lege Dómini.
V. Postquam impléti sunt dies purgatiónis Maríæ, secúndum legem Moysi, tulérunt Jesum in Jerúsalem, ut sísterent eum Sicut scriptum est in lege Dómini.
V. Glória Patri, et Fílio, et Spirítui Sancto.
R. Sicut scriptum est in lege Dómini.
!  Finita Processione, Celebrans et Ministri, depositis violaceis, accipiunt paramenta alba pro Missa. Et Candelæ tenentur in manibus accensæ, dum legitur Evangelium, et iterum ab incepto Canone usque ad expletam Communionem.
! Hodie prohibetur quælibet Missa votiva, etiam sollemniis, de Christo Domino.

[Prelude](rubrica 1960)
!!Blessing of Candles
! If the blessing of candles and the procession cannot take place in the solemn form, because of the absence of sacred ministers, it is lawful to use the simple form, even without chant, provided that at least three servers assist the celebrant.
! The celebrant vests in a white cope or without the chasuble, and goes with the ministers who are similarly vested to bless the candles, which are placed in the center before the altar or on the epistle side. Standing and facing the altar, the priest chants without inflection, with his hands joined:
_
V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with thy spirit.
v. Let us pray. O Holy Lord, Father almighty, everlasting God, who hast created all things out of nothing, and by Thy command hast caused this liquid to become perfect wax by the labor of bees: and who, on this day didst fulfill the petition of the righteous man Simeon: we humbly entreat Thee, that by the invocation of Thy most holy Name and through the intercession of Blessed Mary ever Virgin whose feast is today devoutly observed, and by the prayers of all Thy Saints, Thou wouldst vouchsafe to bless + and sanctify + these candles for the service of men and for the health of their bodies and souls, whether on land or on sea: and that Thou wouldst hear from Thy holy heaven, and from the throne of Thy Majesty the voices of this Thy people, who desire to carry them in their hands with honor, and to praise Thee with hymns; and wouldst be propitious to all that call upon Thee, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God, world without end.
R.: Amen. 	
_
_
v. Let us pray. O almighty and everlasting God, who on this day didst present Thine only-begotten Son in Thy holy temple to be received in the arms of holy Simeon: we humbly entreat Thy clemency, that Thou wouldst vouchsafe to bless + and sanctify + and to kindle with the light of Thy heavenly benediction these candles, which we, Thy servants, desire to receive and to bear lighted in the honor of Thy Name: that, by offering them to Thee our Lord God, being worthily inflamed with the holy fire of Thy most sweet charity, we may deserve to be presented in the holy temple of Thy glory. 
$Per eundem
_
_
v. Let us pray. O Lord Jesus Christ, the true Light who enlightenest every man that cometh into this world: pour forth Thy blessing + upon these candles, and sanctify + them with the light of Thy grace, and mercifully grant, that as these lights enkindled with visible fire dispel the darkness of night, so our hearts illumined by invisible fire, that is, by the splendor of the Holy Spirit, may be free from the blindness of all vice, that the eye of our mind being cleansed, we may be able to discern what is pleasing to Thee and profitable to our salvation; so that after the perilous darkness of this life we may deserve to attain to neverfailing light: through Thee, O Christ Jesus, Savior of the world, who in the perfect Trinity, livest and reignest, God, world without end.
R.: Amen. 	
_
_
v. Let us pray. O almighty and everlasting God, who by Thy servant Moses didst command the purest oil to be prepared for lamps to burn continuously before Thee: vouchsafe to pour forth the grace of Thy blessing + upon these candles: that they may so afford us light outwardly that by Thy gift, the gift of Thy Spirit may never be wanting inwardly to our minds. 
$Per Dominum
_
_ 
v. Let us pray. O Lord Jesus Christ, who appearing on this day among men in the substance of our flesh, wast presented by Thy parents in the temple: whom the venerable and aged Simeon, illuminated by the light of Thy Spirit, recognized, received into his arms, and blessed: mercifully grant that, enlightened and taught by the grace of the same Holy Ghost, we may truly acknowledge Thee and faithfully love Thee; Who with God the Father in the unity of the same Holy Ghost livest and reignest, God, world without end.
R.: Amen. 	
_
_
! After the prayers the celebrant places incense in the thurible. Then he sprinkles the candles with holy water, saying the antiphon Sprinkle me, without chant and without the psalm. Then he incenses the candles three times.
_
_
!! The Distribution of Candles
! Next the senior cleric goes to the altar and the celebrant, without genuflecting, receives a candle from him. Then the celebrant stands in the center before the altar, turns toward the people, and distributes the candles, first to the senior cleric from whom he has received the candle, then to the vested deacon and subdeacon, and to the other clerics in order, one by one, and last of all to the laity. All kneel with the exception of prelates, if any are present. When the distribution of the candles begins, the choir sings:
_
!Antiphon Luc 2:32
Ant. A light for the revelation of the Gentiles: and for the glory of Thy people Israel.
!Luc 2:29-31
v. Now Thou dost dismiss Thy servant, O Lord, according to Thy word in peace.
Ant. A light for the revelation of the Gentiles: and for the glory of Thy people Israel.
v. Because mine eyes have seen Thy salvation.
Ant. A light for the revelation of the Gentiles: and for the glory of Thy people Israel.
v.  Which Thou hast prepared, before the face of all peoples.
Ant. A light for the revelation of the Gentiles: and for the glory of Thy people Israel.
v. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost.
Ant. A light for the revelation of the Gentiles: and for the glory of Thy people Israel.
v. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
Ant. A light for the revelation of the Gentiles: and for the glory of Thy people Israel.
_
_
! After this, is sung:
Ant. Arise, O Lord, help us and deliver us for Thy Name's sake. 
!Ps 43:26
We have heard, O God, with our ears: our fathers have declared to us. 
&Gloria
Ant. Arise, O Lord, help us and deliver us for Thy Name's sake. 
_
_
! After this the priest says:
v. Let us pray.
v. We beseech Thee, O Lord, hearken unto Thy people, and grant that by the light of Thy grace, we may inwardly attain to those things which Thou grantest us outwardly to venerate by this yearly observance. Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen
_
_
!! The Procession
_
! First, the Celebrant places incense in the thurible, then the deacon turns to the people and says:
V. Let us go forth in peace.
R. In the Name of Christ. Amen.
! The thurifer goes first, carrying the thurible, followed by the vested subdeacon, who carries the cross between two acolytes with lighted candles, then the clergy in order, finally the celebrant with the deacon at his left. All hold lighted candles in their hands. The following anthems are sung:
Ant. Adorn thy bridal-chamber, O Sion, and welcome Christ the King: with loving embrace greet Mary who is the very gate of heaven; for she bringeth to thee the glorious King of the new light: remaining ever a Virgin yet she bearest in her arms the Son begotten before the day-star: even the Child, whom Simeon taking into his arms, declared to the peoples to be the Lord of life and death, and the Savior of the world.
_
!Luc 2:26, 27 et 28-29.
Ant. Simeon received an answer from the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death before he had seen the Christ of the Lord; and when they brought the Child into the temple, he took Him into His arms, and blessed God, and said: Now dost Thou dismiss Thy servant, O Lord, in peace. 
V. When His parents brought in the Child Jesus, to do for Him according to the custom of the law, he took Him into His arms.
_
!When the procession re-enters the Church, the choir sings the following:
V. They offered for Him to the Lord a pair of turtle doves, or two young pigeons: * As it is written in the Law of the Lord.
V. After the days of the purification of Mary, according to the law of Moses, were fulfilled, they carried Jesus to Jerusalem, to present Him to the Lord. * As it is written in the Law of the Lord.
V. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost.
R. As it is written in the Law of the Lord.
! When the procession has been completed, the celebrant and ministers put on the vestments for Mass. In the Mass which follows the blessing of candles, the prayers to be said at the foot of the altar are omitted, as well as the prayers “Aufer a nobis” and “Oramus te, Domine.” When the priest comes to the altar, he immediately goes up to it and kisses it in the center. The candles are held during the Gospel and throughout the Canon.

[Lectio]
Lesson from the book of Malachias
!Mal 3:1-4
Thus says the Lord God: Lo, I am sending My messenger to prepare the way before Me; and suddenly there will come to the temple the Lord Whom you seek, and the Messenger of the covenant Whom you desire. Yes. He is coming, says the Lord of Hosts. But who will endure the day of His coming? And who can stand when He appears? For He is like the refinerís fire, or like the fullerís lye. He will sit refining and purifying silver, and He will purify the sons of Levi, refining them like gold or like silver that they may offer due sacrifice to the Lord. Then the sacrifice of Juda and Jerusalem will please the Lord, as in the days of old, as in years gone by,î says the Lord almighty.

[Graduale]
!Ps 47:10-11, 9.
O God, we ponder Your kindness within Your temple. As Your name, O God, so also Your praise reaches to the ends of the earth.
V. As we have heard so have we seen, in the city of our God, in His holy mountain. Allel˙ja, allel˙ja.
V. The old man bore the Child, but the Child was the old man's King; Allel˙ja.

[Tractus]
!Ps 47:10-11, 9.
O God, we ponder Your kindness within Your temple. As Your name, O God, so also Your praise reaches to the ends of the earth.
V. As we have heard so have we seen, in the city of our God, in His holy mountain.
!Luke 2:29-32
Now You dismiss Your servant, O Lord, according to Your word, in peace.
V. Because my eyes have seen Your salvation.
V. Which You have prepared before the face of all peoples.
V. A light of revelation to the Gentiles, and a glory for Your people Israel.

[Evangelium]
Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 2:22-32
At that time, when the days of Maryís purification were fulfilled according to the Law of Moses, they took Jesus up to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord - as it is written in the Law of the Lord, Every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord - and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the Law of the Lord, a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons. And behold, there was in Jerusalem a man named Simeon, and this man was just and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Christ of the Lord. And he came by inspiration of the Spirit into the temple. And when His parents brought in the Child Jesus, to do for Him according to the custom of the Law, he also received Him into his arms and blessed God, saying, Now You dismiss Your servant, O Lord, according to Your word, in peace; because my eyes have seen Your salvation, which You have prepared before the face of all peoples: a light of revelation to the Gentiles, and a glory for Your people Israel.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 44:3
Grace is poured out upon your lips; thus God has blessed you forever, and for ages of ages.

[Secreta]
O Lord, heed our prayer, and give us the help of Your loving kindness so that the gifts we offer before the eyes of Your majesty may be worthy of You.

It was revealed to Simeon by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Christ of the Lord.
