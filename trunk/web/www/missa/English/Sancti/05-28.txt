Lesson from the first letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians
!1 Thess 2:2-9
Brethren: We had confidence in our God to preach to you the gospel of God amid much anxiety. For our exhortation was not from error, nor from impure motives, nor from guile. But as approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak not as pleasing men, but God, who proves our hearts. For at no time have we used words of flattery, as you know, nor any pretext for avarice, God is witness, nor have we sought glory from me, neither from you nor from others. Although as the apostles of Christ we could have claimed a position of honor among you, still while in your midst we were as children: as if a nurse were cherishing her won children, so we in our love for you would gladly have imparted to you not only the gospel of God, but also our own souls; because you had become most dear to us. For you remember, brethren, our labor and toil. We worked night and day so as not to be a burden to any of you while we preached to you the gospel of God.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 10:1-9.
At that time, the Lord appointed seventy-two others, and sent them forth two by~
two before Him into every town and place where He Himself was about to come. And~
He said to them, The harvest indeed is great, but the laborers are few. Pray~
therefore the Lord of the harvest to send forth laborers into His harvest. Go.~
Behold, I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves. Carry neither purse,~
nor wallet, nor sandals, and greet no one on the way. Whatever house you enter,~
first say, ‘Peace to this house!’ And if a son of peace be there, your peace~
will rest upon him; but if not, it will return to you. And remain in the same~
house, eating and drinking what they have; for the laborer deserves his wages.~
Do not go from house to house. And whatever town you enter, and they receive you,~
eat what is set before you, and cure the sick who are there, and say to them,~
‘The kingdom of God is at hand for you.’

[Offertorium]
!Ps 88:25
My faithfulness and My kindness shall be with him, and through My name shall his~
horn be exulted.
