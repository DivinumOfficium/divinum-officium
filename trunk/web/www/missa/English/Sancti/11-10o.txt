Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Romans
!Rom 8:18 - 23.
Brethren: I reckon that the sufferings of the present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory to come that will be revealed in us. For the eager longing of creation awaits the revelation of the sons of God. For creation was made subject to vanity - not by its own will but by reason of Him Who made it subject - in hope, because creation itself also will be delivered from its slavery to corruption into the freedom of the glory of the sons of God. For we know that all creation groans and travails in pain until now. And not only it, but we ourselves also who have the first-fruits of the Spirit - we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption as sons of God, the redemption of our body, in Christ Jesus our Lord.

[Graduale]
!Ps 78:10, 2.
Avenge, O Lord, the shedding of Your servants’ blood.
V. They have given the corpses of Your servants as food to the birds of heaven,~
the flesh of Your faithful ones to the beasts of the earth. Alleluia, alleluia.
!Ps 115:15
V. Precious in the eyes of the Lord is the death of His faithful ones. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 14:12:1 - 8.
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples, Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees,~
which is hypocrisy. But there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed,~
and nothing hidden that will not be made known. For what you have said in~
darkness will be said in the light; and what you have whispered in the inner~
chambers will be preached on the housetops. But I say to you, My friends: Do not~
be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have nothing more that they~
can do. But I will show you Whom you shall be afraid of; be afraid of Him Who,~
after He has killed, has power to cast into hell. Yes, I say to you, be afraid~
of Him. Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings? And yet not one of them is~
forgotten before God. Yes, the very hairs of your head are all numbered.~
Therefore do not be afraid, you are of more value than many sparrows. And I say~
to you, everyone who acknowledges Me before men, him will the Son of Man also~
acknowledge before the angels of God.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 31:11
Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, you just; exult, all you upright of heart.

[Secreta]
We offer You, O Lord, the gifts of our homage; may they be made pleasing to You~
for the honor of all Your just ones, and, by Your mercy, salutary for us.

!Matt 12:50
Whoever does the will of My Father in heaven, he is My brother and sister and~
mother, says the Lord.

[Postcommunio]
Grant, we beseech You, O Lord, by the intercession of blessed Tryphon, Respicius~
and Nympha, Your Martyrs, that what we taste with our lips we may consume with a~
pure heart.
