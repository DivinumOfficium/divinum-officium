Lesson from the book of Revelations
!Apoc 1:1-5
In those days, God signified those things which must shortly come to pass, sending through His Angel to His servant John; who bore witness to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, to whatever he saw. Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep the things that are written therein; for the time is at hand. John to the seven churches that are in Asia: grace be to you and peace from Him Who is and Who was and Who is coming, and from the seven spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ, Who is the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him Who has loved us, and washed us from our sins in His own Blood.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 18:1-10
At that time, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the~
kingdom of heaven? And Jesus called a little child to Him, set him in their~
midst, and said, Amen I say to you, unless you turn and become like little~
children, you will not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whoever, therefore,~
humbles himself as this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of~
heaven. And whoever receives one such little child for My sake, receives Me.~
But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to sin, it were~
better for him to have a great millstone hung around his neck, and to be drowned~
in the depths of the sea. Woe to the world because of scandals! For it must~
needs be that scandals come, but woe to the man through whom scandal does come!~
And if your hand or your foot is an occasion of sin to you, cut it off and cast~
it from you! It is better for you to enter life maimed or lame, than, having two~
hands or two feet, to be cast into the everlasting fire. And if your eye is an~
occasion of sin to you, pluck it out and cast it from you! It is better for you~
to enter into life with one eye, than, having two eyes, to be cast into~
hell-fire. See that you do not despise one of these little ones; for I tell you,~
their Angels in heaven always behold the face of My Father in heaven.

[Offertorium]
!Apoc 8:3-4
An Angel stood near the altar of the temple, having a golden censer in his hand,~
and there was given to him much incense; and the smoke of the perfumes ascended~
before God. Alleluia.

[Secreta]
We offer You sacrifices of praise, O Lord, humbly praying You to accept them~
graciously and to grant that they may be helpful for our salvation through the~
intercession of the Angels who intercede for us.

[Communio]
!Dan 3:58
All you Angels of the Lord, bless the Lord: sing a hymn, and exalt Him above all~
forever. (Alleluia.)

[Postcommunio]
Relying upon the intercession of blessed Michael, Your Archangel, O Lord, we~
humbly pray You, that what we have received by our mouth may give grace to our~
mind.
