[Lectio]
A reading from the Epistle of blessed Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians.
!1 Cor 7:25-34
Brethren: Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord; but~
I give counsel, as having obtained mercy of the Lord, to be faithful. I~
think therefore that this is good for the present necessity, that it is~
good for a man so to be. Art thou bound to a wife? seek not to be~
loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife. But if thou take a~
wife, thou hast not sinned. And if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned:~
nevertheless, such shall have tribulation of the flesh. But I spare you.~
This therefore I say, brethren; the time is short; it remaineth, that~
they also who have wives, be as if they had none; And they that weep, as~
though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as if they rejoiced not;~
and they that buy, as though they possessed not; And they that use this~
world, as if they used it not: for the fashion of this world passeth~
away. But I would have you to be without solicitude. He that is without~
a wife, is solicitous for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may~
please God. But he that is with a wife, is solicitous for the things of~
the world, how he may please his wife: and he is divided. And the~
unmarried woman and the virgin thinketh on the things of the Lord, that~
she may be holy both in body and in spirit: in Christ Jesus our Lord.

!Matth 13:45-46
The kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.~
When he finds a single pearl of great price, he goes and sells all~
that he has and buys it.
