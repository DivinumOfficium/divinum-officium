!Advent
It is truly fitting and proper, right and profitable to salvation, that we should at all times and in all places give thanks to You, Lord, holy Father, Almighty and everlasting God, through Christ our Lord. For You have promised Him, O faithful and merciful One, as a Savior for the lost human race; so that His truth might instruct the ignorant, His holiness might sanctify sinners, and His power might strengthen the weak. Since, therefore, the time of His coming is near, and the day of our liberation is dawning, we trust in Your promises and exult with joyous love. And, therefore, with Angels and Archangels, with Thrones and Dominations, and with the whole host of the heavenly army, we sing a hymn to Your glory, saying without ceasing:

And therefore with Angels and Archangels, with Throne and Dominations, and with all the hosts of the heavenly army, we sing the hymn of Thy glory, evermore saying:

Through whom the Angels praise Thy Majesty, the Dominations worship it, the Powers stand in awe. The Heavens and the heavenly hosts together with the blessed Seraphim in triumphant chorus unite to celebrate it.

v. It it truly meet and just, right and for our salvation, that we should at all times, and in all places, give thanks unto Thee, O holy Lord, Father almighty, everlasting God; Who didst will that Thine only-begotten Son, while hanging on the cross, should be pierced by a soldier's spear, that the Heart thus opened, a shrine of divine bounty, should pour out on us streams of mercy and grace, and that what never ceased to burn with love for us, should be a resting-place to the devout, and open as a refuge of salvation to the penitent.

Through whom the Angels praise Thy Majesty, the Dominations worship it, and the Powers stand in awe.

It it truly meet and just, right and for our salvation, that we should at all times, and in all places, give thanks unto Thee, O holy Lord, Father almighty, everlasting God, through Christ our Lord.

For to Thy faithful people, O Lord, life is changed, not taken away: and when the home of this earthly sojourn is dissolved, an eternal dwelling place is being prepared in the heavens. And therefore with Angels and Archangels, with Thrones and Dominations, and with all the hosts of the heavenly army, we sing the hymn of Thy glory, evermore saying:

[Baptist]
!St. John the Baptist
It is truly meet and just, right and for our salvation, that we should at all times and in all places give thanks unto Thee, O holy Lord, almighty Father, eternal God.  And to praise Thy magnificence also in blessed John the Baptist, the Precursor, who, yet unborn, felt the voice of the Mother of the Lord, and, yet enclosed in the womb, foreshadowed with prophetic exultation the advent of human salvation: Whose conception removed the sterility of his mother and whose birth loosed the tongue of his father: who alone among all the prophets pointed to the Redeemer of the world, Whom he foretold: and, that the nature of water might take on the effect of sacred purification for those to be sanctified in the flow of the Jordan, washed in baptism the Author of Baptism Himself.  And therefore with the Angels and Archangels, with the Thrones and Dominions, and with all the hosts of the heavenly army, we sing a hymn to Thy glory, evermore saying:
