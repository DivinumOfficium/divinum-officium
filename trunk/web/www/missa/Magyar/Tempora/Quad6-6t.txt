!! The Blessing of the Fire
! At a convenient time, the altar is prepared, and the Hours are recited in choir, but the candles are not lighted until the beginning of Mass.  Meanwhile fire is struck from a flint outside the church and coals are kindled from it. Near at hand lies a vessel containing five large grains of incense to be set in the paschal candle.  The celebrant wearing amice, alb, girdle, stole and purple cope, goes to the church door accompanied by his ministers with the processional cross, holy water and incense, and blesses the new fire. -- The liturgy makes use of the fire or light as a symbol of Christ, whose teaching enlightens the minds of the faithful and whose grace enkindles thir hearts.  Hence the importance attached to the blessing of the candles on February 2, and the blessing of the new fire and paschal candle on this day. The priest first blesses the new fire, saying:
V.  The Lord be with you.
R.  And with thy spirit.
v. Let us pray. 
O God, Who hast bestowed on the faithful the fire of Thy brightness by Thy Son, Who is the Corner-stone, hallow + this new fire produced from a flint that it may be profitable to us: and grant that during this Paschal festival we may be so inflamed with heavenly desires, that with pure minds we may come to the solemnity of perpetual light.  Through the same Christ our Lord.  
R.  Amen.
_
_
v.  Let us pray. 
O Lord God, almighty Father, never-failing Light, Who art the Creator of all lights, bless this light that is blessed + and sanctified by Thee, Who hast enlightened the whole world: that we may be inflamed with that light and englithened by the fire of Thy brightness: and as Thou didst give light to Moses when he went out of Egypt, so nlighten our hearts and senses, that we may be found worthy to arrive at light and life everlasting.  Through Christ our Lord.  
R. Amen.
_
_
v. Let us pray. 
O holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God: vouchsafe to co-operate with us, who bless this fire in Thy Name, and in that of Thine only-begotten Son Jesus Christ our Lord and God, and of the Holy Ghost: help us against the fiery darts of the enemy, and illumine us with Thy heavenly grace.  Who livest and reignest with the same Thine only-begotten Son and the Holy Ghost, one God, for ever and ever. 
 R.  Amen.
_
_
!   He then blesses the five grains of incense to be placed in the paschal candle, saying the following prayer:
v. May the abundant outpouring of Thy + blessing, we beseech Thee, almighty God, descend upon this incense: and do Thou, O invisible Regenerator, lighten this nocturnal brightness, that not only the sacrifice that is offered this night may shine by the secret mixture of Thy light: but also into whatever place anything of this mysterious sanctification shall be brought, there the power of Thy Majesty may be present and all the malicious artifices of Satan may be defeated.  Through Christ our Lord.  
R. Amen.
_
!   During this prayer an acolyte fills the thurible with coals from the blessed fire.  The celebrant then puts incense into the thurible, blessing it in the usual manner: he sprinkles the grains of incense and the new fire thrice with holy water, saying the Asperges Me, without the psalm,and thrice incenses them.  All the lamps in the church are extinguished, that they may afterward be lighted from the blessed fire. The deacon, vested in a white dalmatic, now takes up a reed with a triple candle fixed on the top: and all enter the church.  The thurifer goes first, with an acolyte carring in a dish the five grains of incense; the subdeacon follows with the cross, and the clergy in order; then the deacon with the reed and after him the officiating priest.  When the deacon has entered the church, he lowers the reed, and an acolyte, bringing a taper lighted from the new fire, lights one of the three candles set on the top; and the deacon, raising the reed, kneels down, as do all the rest, except the subdeacon who carries the cross, and sings:
V. The light of Christ.
R.  Thanks be to God.
!   In the middle of the church the second branch of the candle is lighted, with the same ceremonies; and the third branch is lighted in the sanctuary, the deacon each time singing: Lumen Christi on a higher tone.
V. The light of Christ.
R.  Thanks be to God.
_
V. The light of Christ.
R.  Thanks be to God.

!! The Blessing of the Paschal Candle
!   The celebrant goes up to the epistle corner; and the deacon takes the book and asks the priest's blessing, as at the gospel; the blessing is given in the following words:
v. May the Lord be in thy heart and on thy lips, that thou mayest worthily and fitly proclaim His Paschal praise.  In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, + and of the Holy Ghost. 
R.  Amen.
!   Then the deacon goes up to the lectern, puts the book on it and incenses it.  At his right hand stands the subdeacon with the cross, and the thurifer, at his left two acoltyes holding the reed and the grains of incense which are to be fixed in the candle.  All rise and stand as at the Gospel, and the deacon sings the Exsultet which is remarkable for its lyric beauty and symbolism and contains allusions to the Jewish Pasch and Christian Baptism.  We are reminded here that the whole of this Office was originally a Vigil and took place during the night between Saturday and Sunday.  The Mass which closes it was said at dawn on Easter Sunday.  The expressions as those of the Exsultet: haec nox est . . .; O vere beata nox . . .; etc., and those of the Mass: Deus, qui hanc sacratissimam noctem . . . (Collect), and of the Canon et noctem sacratissimam . . . -- recall the fact that it was during the night (nox) that this service was originally held.
_
!   The deacon proceeds to the blessing of the paschal candle, while singing:
v. Let the angelic choirs of Heaven now rejoice; let the divine Mysteries rejoice; and let the trumpet of salvation sound forth the victory of so great a King.  Let the earth also rejoice, made radiant by such splendor; and, enlightened with the brightness of the eternal King, let it know that the darkness of the whole world is scattered.  Let our mother the Church also rejoice, adorned with the brightness of so great a light; and let this temple resound with the loud acclamations of the people.  Wherefore I beseech you, most beloved brethren, who are here present in the wondrous brightness of this holy light, to invoke wtih me the mercy of almighty God.  That He who has vouchsafed to admit me among the Levites, without any merits of mine, would pour forth the brightness of His light upon me, and enable me to perfect the praise of this wax candle.  Through our Lord Jesus Christ His Son, Who with Him and the Holy Ghost liveth and reigneth one God for ever and ever.  
R. Amen.
V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with thy spirit.
V. Lift up your hearts.
R. We have them lifted up to the Lord.
V. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
R. It is meet and just.
v. It is truly meet and right to proclaim with all our heart and all the affection of our mind, and with the ministry of our voices, the invisible God, the Father almighty, and His only-begotten Son our Lord Jesus Christ, who repaid for us to His eternal Father the debt of Adam, and by the merciful shedding of His Blood, cancelled the debt incurred by original sin.  For this is the Paschal Festival; in which that true Lamb is slain, with Whose Blood the doorposts of the faithful are consecrated.  This is the night in which Thou didst formerly cause our forefathers, the children of Israel, when brought out of Egypt, to pass through the Red Sea with dry foot.  This, therefore, is the night which dissipated the darkness of sinners by the light of the pillar.  This is the night which at this time throughout the world restores to grace and unites in sanctity those that believe in Christ, and are separated from the vices of the world and the darkness of sinners.  This is the night in which, destroying the chains of death, Christ arose victorious from the grave.  For it would have profited us nothing to have been born, unless redemption had also been bestowed upon us.  O wondrous condescension of Thy mercy towards us!  O inestimable affection of love: that Thou mightest redeem a slave, Thou didst deliver up Thy Son!  O truly needful sin of Adam, which was blotted out by the death of Christ!  O happy fault, that merited to possess such and so great a Redeemer!  O truly blessed night, which alone deserved to know the time and hour when Christ rose again from hell!  This is the night of which it is written: And the night shall be as clear as the day; and the night is my light in my delights.  Therefore the hallowing of this night puts to flight all wickedness, cleanses sins, and restores innocence to the fallen, and gladness to the sorrowful.  It drives forth hatreds, it prepares concord, and brings down haughtiness.
_
!   Here the deacon fixes the five blessed grains of incense in the paschal candle in the form of a cross.
v. Wherefore, in this sacred night, receive, O holy Father, the evening sacrifice of this incense, which holy Church renders to Thee by the hands of Thy ministers in the solemn offering of this wax candle, made out the work of bees.  Now also we know the praises of this pillar, which the shining fire enkindles to the honor of God.
_
!   Here the deacon lights the paschal candel with one of the three candles on the reed.
v. Which fire, although divided into parts, suffers no loss from its light being borrowed.  For it is nourished by the melting wax, which the mother bee produced for the substance of this precious light.
_
!   Here the lamps are lighted.
v. O truly blessed night, which plundered the Egyptians and enriched the Hebrews!  A night in which heavenly things are united to those of earth, and things divine to those which are of man.  We beseech Thee, therefore, O Lord, that this wax candle hallowed in honor of Thy Name, may continue to burn to dissipate the darkness of this night.  And being accepted as a sweet savor, may be united with teh ehavently lights.  Let the mornign star find its flame alight.  That star, I mean, which knows no setting.  He Who returning from hell, serenely shone forth upon mankind.  We beseech Thee therefore, O Lord, that Thou wouldst grant peaceful times during this Paschal Festival, and vouchsafe to rule, govern, and keep with Thy constant protection us Thy servnats, and all the clergy, and the devout people, together with our most holy Father, Pope N...., and our Bishop N....  Through the same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, who with Thee and the Holy Ghost liveth and reigneth one God for ever and ever.  
R.  Amen.

!! The Reading of the Prophecies
!   After the blessing of the paschal candle the deacon lays aside his white dalmatic and puts on a purple one, and the officiating priest takes off his purple cope and puts on a purple chasuble.  The prophecies are then chanted without any title, while the celebrant, standing at the epistle corner, reads them in a low voice.  The twelve prophecies were formerly addressed to the catechumens, who would find therein outlined the principal points of Christian Doctrine; they were interspersed with prayers and tracts which sum up or explain the teaching contained in the Lessons just read.
!The first Prophecy
!Gen. 1:1-31; 2:1-2
! The creation of the world. -- The man created after the image of God and His likeness had dominion over all living creatures.
In the beginning, God created heaven and earth.  And the earth was void and empty, and darkness was upon the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God moved over the water.  And God said: Be light made.  And light was made.  And God saw the light that it was good: and He divided the light from the darkness.  And He called the light Day, and the darkness Night: and there was evening and morning, one day.  And God said: Let there be a firmament made amidst the waters: and let it divide the waters from the waters.  And God made a firmament, and divided the waters that were under the firmament from those that were above the firmament.  And it was so.  And God called the firmament Heaven: and the evening and morning were the second day.  God also said: Let the waters that are under the heaven be gathered together into one place; and let the dry land appear.  And it was so done.  And God called the dry land Earth: and the gathering together of the waters He called Seas.  And God saw that it was good.  And He said: Let the earth bring forth his green herb, after its kind, which may have seed in itself upon the earth.  And it was so done.  And the earth brought forth the green herb, and such as tieldeth seed according to its kind.  And God saw that it was good.  And the evening and morning were the third day.  And God said: Let there be lights made in the firmament of heaven to divide the day and the night, and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years.: to shine in the firmament of heaven. and to give light to the earth.  And it was so done.  And God made two great lights: a greater light to rule the day; and a lesser light to rule the night: and the stars.  And He set them in the firmament of heaven, to shine upon the earth, and to rule the day and the night, and to divide the earth, and to rule the day and the night, and to divide the light and the darkness.  And God saw that it was good.  And the evening and morning were the fourth day.  God also said: Let het waters bring forth the creeping creature having life, and the fowl that may fly over the earth under the firmament of heaven.  And God created the great whales, and every living thing and moving creature which the waters brought forth, according to their kinds, and every winged fowl according to its kind.  And God saw that it was good.  And He blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply, and fill the waters of the sea: and let the birds be multiplied upon the earth.  And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.  And God said: Let the earth bring forth the living creature in its kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.  And it was so done.  And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds, and cattle, and every thing and every thing that creepeth on the earth after its kind.  And God saw that it was good.  And He said: Let us make man to His own image and likeness: and let him have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and the beasts, and the whole earth, and every creeping creature that moveth upon the earth.  And God created man to His own image: to the image of God He created him, male and female He created them.  And God blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it, and rule over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and all living creatures that move upon the earth.  And God said: Behold, I have given you every herb-bearing seed upon the earth, and all trees that have in themselves seed of their own kind to be your meat: and to all the beasts of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to all that move upon the earth, and wherein there is life, that they may have to feed upon.  And it was so done.  And God saw all the things that He had made, and they were very good.  And the evening and morning were the sixth day.  So the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the furniture of them.  And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had made: and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done.

!The second Prophecy
!Gen. 5, 6, 7, and 8
! The deluge. -- The ark is the prefigure of the true Church, which is the Ark of Salvation.
Noe, when he was five hundred years old, begot Sem, Cham, and Japheth.  And after that men began to be multiplied upon the earth, and daughters were born to them, the sons of God seeing the daughters of men, that they were fair, took to themselves wives of all, which they chose.  And God said: My Spirit shall not remain in man for ever, because he is flesh: and his days shall be a hundred and twenty years.  Now giants were upon the earth in those days.  For after the sons of God went in to the daughters of men, and they brought forth children, thse are the mighty men of old, men of renown.  And God seeing that the wickedness of men was great on the earth, and that all the thought of their heart was bent upon evil at all times, it repented Him that He had made man on the earth.  And being touched inwardly with sorrow of heart, He said: I will destroy man, whom I have created, from the face of the earth, from man even to beasts, from the creeping thing even to the fowls of the air; for it repenteth Me that I have made them.  But Noe found grace before the Lord.  These are the generations of Noe: Noe was a just and perfect man in his generations, he walked with God.  And he begot three sons, Sem, Cham, and Japheth.  And the earth was corrupted before God, and was filled with iniquity.  And when God had seen that the earth was corrupted (for all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth), He said to Noe: The end of all flesh is come before Me: the earth is filled with iniquity through them, and I will destroy them with the earth.  Make thee an ark of timber planks: thou shalt make little rooms in the ark, and thou shalt pitch it within and without.  And thus shalt thou make it: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.  Thou shalt make a window in the ark, and in a cubit shall thou finish the top of it: and the door of the ark thou shalt set in the side; with lower, middle chambers and third stories shalt thou make it.  Behold I will bring the waters of a great flood upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, under heaven.  All things that are in the earth shall be consumed, and I will establish My covenant with thee: and thou shalt enter into the ark, thou and thy sons, and thy wife, and the wives of thy sons with thee.  And of every living creature of all flesh, thou shalt bring two of a sort into the ark, that they may live with thee: of the male sex, and the female.  Of fowls according to their kind: two of every sort shall go in with thee, that they may live.  Thou shalt take unto thee of all food that may be eaten, and thou shalt lay it up with thee: and it shall be food for thee and them.  And Noe did all things which God commanded Him.  And he was six hundred years old when the waters of the flood overflowed the earth.  All the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the flood-gates of heaven were opened; and the rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights.  In the self-same day, Noe, and Shem, and Cham, and Japheth, his sons, his wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, went into the ark: they and every beast according to its kind, and all the cattle in their kind, and every thing that moveth upon the earth according to its kind.  And the ark was carried upon the waters.  And the waters prevailed beyond measure upon the earth: and all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered.  The water was fiften cubits higher than the mountains which it covered.  And all flesh was destroyed that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beasts, and of all creeping things that creep upon the earth.  And Noe only remained, and they that were with him in th eark.  And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.  And God remembered Noe, and all the living creaturs and all the cattle which were with him in the ark, and brought a wind upon the earth, and the waters were abated.  The fountains also of the deep, and the flood-gates of heaven were shut up: and the rain from heaven was restrained.  And the waters returned from off the earth, going and coming: and they begam to be abated after a hundred and fifty days.  And after that forty days were passed, Noe, opening the window of the ark which he had made, sent forth a raven, which went forth and did not return, till the waters were dried up upon the earth.  He sent forth also a dove after him, to see if the waters had now ceased upon the face of the earth.  But she not finding where her foot might rest, returned to him into the ark: for the waters were upon the whole earth: and he put forth his hand, and caught her, and brought her into the ark.  And having waited yet seven other days, he again sent forth the dove out of the ark.  And she came to him in the evening, carrying a bough of an olive tree with green leaves in her mouth.  Noe therefore understood that the waters were ceased upon the earth.  And he stayed yet another seven days: and he sent forth the dove, which returned not any more unto him.  And God spoke to Noe, saying: Go out of the ark, thou and thy wife, thy sons, and the wives of thy sons with thee.  All living things that are with thee of all flesh, as well in fowls as in beasts, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, bring out with thee, and go ye upon the earth: increase and multiply upon it.  So Noe went out, he and his sons, his wife, and the wives of his sons with him.  And all living things, and cattle, and creeping things that creep upon the earth, according to their kinds, went out of the ark.  And Noe built an altar unto the Lord, and taking of all cattle and fowls that were clean, offered holocausts upon the altar.  And the Lord smelled a sweet savor.

!The third Prophecy
!Gen. 22. 1-19
! The offering of Abraham is a figure of the Sacrifice of the Cross.  Faith and obedience of Abraham.
In those days God tempted Abraham, and said to him: Abraham, Abraham.  And he answered: Here I am.  He said to him: Take thine only-begotten son, Isaac, whom thou lovest, and go into the land of vision: and there thou shalt offer him for a holocaust upon one of the mountains which I will show thee.  So Abraham, rising up in the night, saddled his ass: and took with him two young men, and Isaac his son.  And when he had cut wood for the holocaust, he went his way to the place which God had commanded him.  And on the third day, lifting up his eyes, he saw the place afar off; and he said to his young men: Stay you here with the ass: I and the boy will go with speed as far as yonder, and after we have worshipped will return to you.  And he took the wood for the holocaust and laid it upon Isaac his son: and he himself carried in his hands fire and a sword.  And as they two were on together, Isaac said to his father: My father.  And he answered: What wilt thou, son?  Behold, saith he, fire and wood: where is the victim for the holocaust?  And Abraham said: God will provide Himself a victim for a holocaust, my son.  So they went on together; and they came to the place which God had shown him, where he built an altar and laid the wood in order upon it; and when he had bound Isaac, his son, he laid him upon the altar upon the pile of wood.  And he put forth his hand, and took the sword to sacrifice his son.  And behold an angel of the Lord from heaven called to him, saying: Abraham, Abraham.  And he answered: Here I am.  And he said to him: Lay not thy hand upon the boy, neither do thou any thing to him: now I know that thou fearest God, and hast not spared thine only-begotten son for My sake.  Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw behind his back a ram amongst the briers, sticking fast by the horns, which he took and offered for a holocaust instead of his son.  And he called the name of that place, the Lord seeth.  Whereupon even to this day it is said: In the mountain the Lord will see.  And the angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from heaven, saying: By My own self have I sworn, saith the Lord: because Thou hast done this thing, and hast not spared thine only-begotten son for My sake; I will bless thee, and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that is by the sea shore: thy seed shall possess the gates of their enemies, and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because thou hast obeyed my voice.  Abraham returned to his young men, and they went to Bersabee together, and he dwelt there.

!The fourth Prophecy
!Exo. 14, 24; 15. 1
! As Moses freed the Israelites from the captivity of Egypt, so Christ by baptism reserves the catechumens from the yoke of Satan.
In those days, it came to pass in the morning watch, and behold the Lord looking upon the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire, and of the cloud, slew their host: and overthrew the wheels of the chariots, and they were carried into the deep.  And the Egyptians said: Let us flee from Israel: for the Lord fighteth for them against us.  And the Lord said to Moses: Stretch forth thy hand over the sea, that the waters may com again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots and horsemen.  And when Moses had stretched forth his hand towards the sea, it returned at the first break of day to the former place: and as the Egyptians were fleeing away the waters came upon them, and the Lord shut them up in the middle of the waves.  And the waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen of all the army of Pharao, who had come into the sea after them: neither did there so much as one of them remain.  But the children of Israel marched through the midst of the sea upon dry land, and the waters were to thm as a wall on the right hand and the left: and the Lord delivered Israel on that day out of the hand of the Egyptians.  And they saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore, and the mighty hand of the Lord had used against them: and the people feared the Lord, and they believed the Lord, and Moses His servant.  Then Moses and the children of Israel sung this canticle to the Lord, and said:

!The fifth Prophecy
!Isa 54:17; 55:1-11
This is the inheritance of the servants of the Lord, and their justice with me, saith the Lord. All you that thirst, come to the waters: and you that have no money make haste, buy, and eat: come ye, buy wine and milk without money, and without any price. Why do you spend money for that which is not bread, and your labour for that which doth not satisfy you? Hearken diligently to me, and eat that which is good, and your soul shall be delighted in fatness. Incline your ear and come to me: hear and your soul shall live, and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, the faithful mercies of David. Behold I have given him for a witness to the people, for a leader and a master to the Gentiles. Behold thou shalt call a nation, which thou knewest not: and the nations that knew not thee shall run to thee, because of the Lord thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel, for he hath glorified thee. Seek ye the Lord, while he may be found: call upon him, while he is near. Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unjust man his thoughts, and let him return to the Lord, and he will have mercy on him, and to our God: for he is bountiful to forgive. For my thoughts are not your thoughts: nor your ways my ways, saith the Lord. For as the heavens are exalted above the earth, so are my ways exalted above your ways, and my thoughts above your thoughts. And as the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and return no more thither, but soak the earth, and water it, and make it to spring, and give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater: So shall my word be, which shall go forth from my mouth: it shall not return to me void, but it shall do whatsoever I please, and shall prosper in the things for which I sent it.

!The sixth Prophecy
!Baruch 3:9-38
Hear, O Israel, the commandments of life: give ear, that thou mayst learn wisdom. How happeneth it, O Israel, that thou art in thy enemies' land? Thou art grown old in a strange country, thou art defiled with the dead: thou art counted with them that go down into hell. Thou hast forsaken the fountain of wisdom: For if thou hadst walked in the way of God, thou hadst surely dwelt in peace for ever. Learn where is wisdom, where is strength, where is understanding: that thou mayst know also where is length of days and life, where is the light of the eyes, and peace. Who hath found out her place? and who hath gone in to her treasures? Where are the princes of the nations, and they that rule over the beasts that are upon the earth? That take their diversion with the birds of the air. That hoard up silver and gold, wherein men trust, and there is no end of their getting? who work in silver and are solicitous, and their works are unsearchable. They are cut off, and are gone down to hell, and others are risen up in their place. Young men have seen the light, and dwelt upon the earth: but the way of knowledge they have not known, Nor have they understood the paths thereof, neither have their children received it, it is far from their face. It hath not been heard of in the land of Chanaan, neither hath it been seen in Theman. The children of Agar also, that search after the wisdom that is of the earth, the merchants of Merrha, and of Theman, and the tellers of fables, and searchers of prudence and understanding: but the way of wisdom they have not known, neither have they remembered her paths. O Israel, how great is the house of God, and how vast is the place of his possession! It is great, and hath no end: it is high and immense. There were the giants, those renowned men that were from the beginning, of great stature, expert in war. The Lord chose not them, neither did they find the way of knowledge: therefore did they perish. And because they had not wisdom, they perished through their folly. Who hath gone up into heaven, and taken her, and brought her down from the clouds? Who hath passed over the sea, and found her, and brought her preferably to chosen gold? here is none that is able to know her ways, nor that can search out her paths: But he that knoweth all things, knoweth her, and hath found her out with his understanding: he that prepared the earth for evermore, and filled it with cattle and fourfooted beasts: He that sendeth forth light, and it goeth: and hath called it, and it obeyeth him with trembling. And the stars have given light in their watches, and rejoiced: They were called, and they said: Here we are: and with cheerfulness they have shined forth to him that made them. This is our God, and there shall no other be accounted of in comparison of him. He found out all the way of knowledge, and gave it to Jacob his servant, and to Israel his beloved. Afterwards he was seen upon earth, and conversed with men.

!The seventh Prophecy
!Ezech 37:1-14
The hand of the Lord was upon me, and brought me forth in the spirit of the Lord: and set me down in the midst of a plain that was full of bones. And he led me about through them on every side: now they were very many upon the face of the plain, and they were exceeding dry. And he said to me: Son of man, dost thou think these bones shall live? And I answered: O Lord God, thou knowest. And he said to me: Prophesy concerning these bones; and say to them: Ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. Thus saith the Lord God to these bones: Behold, I will send spirit into you, and you shall live. And I will lay sinews upon you, and will cause flesh to grow over you, and will cover you with skin: and I will give you spirit and you shall live, and you shall know that I am the Lord. And I prophesied as he had commanded me: and as I prophesied there was a noise, and behold a commotion: and the bones came together, each one to its joint. And I saw, and behold the sinews, and the flesh came up upon them: and the skin was stretched out over them, but there was no spirit in them. And he said to me: Prophesy to the spirit, prophesy, O son of man, and say to the spirit: Thus saith the Lord God: Come, spirit, from the four winds, and blow upon these slain, and let them live again. And I prophesied as he had commanded me: and the spirit came into them, and they lived: and they stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army. And he said to me: Son of man: All these bones are the house of Israel: they say: Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost, and we are cut off. Therefore prophesy, and say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I will open your graves, and will bring you out of your sepulchres, O my people: and will bring you into the land of Israel. And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have opened your sepulchres, and shall have brought you out of your graves, O my people: And shall have put my spirit in you, and you shall live, and I shall make you rest upon your own land: and you shall know that I the Lord have spoken, and done it, saith the Lord God.

Speak ye to the whole assembly of the children of Israel, and say to them: On the tenth day of this month let every man take a lamb by their families and houses. But if the number be less than may suffice to eat the lamb, he shall take unto him his neighbour that joineth to his house, according to the number of souls which may be enough to eat the lamb. And it shall be a lamb without blemish, a male, of one year: according to which rite also you shall take a kid. And you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month: and the whole multitude of the children of Israel shall sacrifice it in the evening. And they shall take of the blood thereof, and put it upon both the side posts, and on the upper door posts of the houses, wherein they shall eat it. And they shall eat the flesh that night roasted at the fire, and unleavened bread with wild lettuce. You shall not eat thereof any thing raw, nor boiled in water, but only roasted at the fire: you shall eat the head with the feet and entrails thereof. Neither shall there remain any thing of it until morning. If there be any thing left, you shall burn it with fire.

And the word of the Lord came to Jonas the second time, saying: Arise, and go to Ninive the great city: and preach in it the preaching that I bid thee. And Jonas arose, and went to Ninive, according to the word of the Lord: now Ninive was a great city of three days' journey. And Jonas began to enter into the city one day's journey: and he cried, and said: Yet forty days, and Ninive shall be destroyed. And the men of Ninive believed in God: and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth from the greatest to the least. And the word came to the king of Ninive; and he rose up out of his throne, and cast away his robe from him, and was clothed with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. And he caused it to be proclaimed and published in Ninive from the mouth of the king and of his princes, saying: Let neither men nor beasts, oxen nor sheep, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water. And let men and beasts be covered with sackcloth, and cry to the Lord with all their strength, and let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the iniquity that is in their hands. Who can tell if God will turn, and forgive: and will turn away from his fierce anger, and we shall not perish?

Therefore after Moses had wrote the words of this law in a volume, and finished it: He commanded the Levites, who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord. saying: Take this book, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God: that it may be there for a testimony against thee. For I know thy obstinacy, and thy most stiff neck, While I am yet living, and going in with you, you have always been rebellious against the Lord: how much more when I shall be dead? Gather unto me all the ancients of your tribes, and your doctors, and I will speak these words in their hearing, and will call heaven and earth to witness against them. For I know that, after my death, you will do wickedly, and will quickly turn aside from the way that I have commanded you: and evils shall come upon you in the latter times, when you shall do evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him by the works of your hands.

!The twelfth Prophecy
!Dan 3:1-24.
King Nabuchodonosor made a statue of gold, of sixty cubits high, and six cubits broad, and he set it up in the plain of Dura of the province of Babylon. Then Nabuchodonosor the king sent to call together the nobles, the magistrates, and the judges, the captains, the rulers, and governors, and all the chief men of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the statue which king Nabuchodonosor had set up. Then the nobles, the magistrates, and the judges, the captains, and rulers, and the great men that were placed in authority, and all the princes of the provinces, were gathered together to come to the dedication of the statue, which king Nabuchodonosor had set up. And they stood before the statue which king Nabuchodonosor had set up. Then a herald cried with a strong voice: To you it is commanded, O nations, tribes, and languages: That in the hour that you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, and of the flute, and of the harp, of the sackbut, and of the psaltery, and of the symphony, and of all kind of music; ye fall down and adore the golden statue which king Nabuchodonosor hath set up. But if any man shall not fall down and adore, he shall the same hour be cast into a furnace of burning fire. Upon this therefore, at the time when all the people heard the sound of the trumpet, the flute, and the harp, of the sackbut, and the psaltery, of the symphony, and of all kind of music: all the nations, tribes, and languages fell down and adored the golden statue which king Nabuchodonosor had set up. And presently at that very time some Chaldeans came and accused the Jews, And said to king Nabuchodonosor: O king, live for ever: Thou, O king, hast made a decree that every man that shall hear the sound of the trumpet, the flute, and the harp, of the sackbut, and the psaltery, of the symphony, and of all kind of music, shall prostrate himself, and adore the golden statue: And that if any man shall not fall down and adore, he should be cast into a furnace of burning fire. Now there are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the works of the province of Babylon, Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago: these men, O king, have slighted thy decree: they worship not thy gods, nor do they adore the golden statue which thou hast set up. Then Nabuchodonosor in fury, and in wrath, commanded that Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago should be brought: who immediately were brought before the king. And Nabuchodonosor the king spoke to them, and said: Is it true, O Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, that you do not worship my gods, nor adore the golden statue that I have set up? Now therefore if you be ready at what hour soever you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, flute, harp, sackbut, and psaltery, and symphony, and of all kind of music, prostrate yourselves, and adore the statue which I have made: but if you do not adore, you shall be cast the same hour into the furnace of burning fire: and who is the God that shall deliver you out of my hand? Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago answered and said to king Nabuchodonosor: We have no occasion to answer thee concerning this matter. For behold our God, whom we worship, is able to save us from the furnace of burning fire, and to deliver us out of thy hands, O king. But if he will not, be it known to thee, O king, that we will not worship thy gods, nor adore the golden statue which thou hast set up. Then was Nabuchodonosor filled with fury: and the countenance of his face was changed against Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, and he commanded that the furnace should be heated seven times more than it had been accustomed to be heated. And he commanded the strongest men that were in his army, to bind the feet of Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, and to cast them into the furnace of burning fire. And immediately these men were bound and were cast into the furnace of burning fire, with their coats, and their caps, and their shoes, and their garments. For the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace was heated exceedingly. And the flame of the fire slew those men that had cast in Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago. But these three men, that is, Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, fell down bound in the midst of the furnace of burning fire. And they walked in the midst of the flame, praising God and blessing the Lord.

!!The Blessing of the Baptismal Water

_
!Tract
!Ps 41:2-4.
v. As the hart panteth after the fountains of water; so my soul panteth after thee, O God. 
V. My soul hath thirsted after the strong living God; when shall I come and appear before the face of God? 
V. My tears have been my bread day and night, whilst it is said to me daily: Where is thy God? 
_`
!Before the priest enters the baptistery, the following prayer is said:
V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with thy spirit.
v. Let us pray.
O Almighty and everlasting God, look mercifully on the devotion of Thy people about to be reborn, who like the hart pant after the fountain of Thy waters: and mercifully grant that the thirst of their faith may, by the Sacrament of Baptism, hallow their souls and bodies.

!When the priest enter the baptistery, the blessing is performed as follows:
V.  The Lord be with you.
R.  And with thy spirit.
v. Let us pray.
O Almighty and eternal God, be present at these mysteries, be present at these sacraments of thy great goodness: and send forth the spirit of thy adoption to regenerate the new people, whom the font of baptism bringeth forth: that what is to be done by the ministry of us thy servants, may be accomplished by the effect of thy power. Through our Lord Jesus Christ thy Son, who with thee liveth and reigneth in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God,
!Elevans vocem in modum Frćfationis, prosequitur junctis manibus:
v. World without end.
R. Amen.
V.  The Lord be with you.
R.  And with thy spirit.
V. Lift up thy hearts.
R. We have them lifted up to the Lord.
V. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
R. It is meet and just.
v. It is meet and just, right and availing unto salvation, to give Thee thanks always and in all places, O holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God, Who, by Thine ineffable power dost wonderfully produce the effect of Thy Sacraments: and though we are unworthy to perform such great mysteries: yet, as Thou dost not abandon the gifts of Thy grace, so Thou inclinest the ears of Thy goodness, even to our prayers. O God, Whose Spirit in the very beginning of the world moved over the waters, that even then the nature of water might receive the virtue of sanctification. O God, Who by water didst wash away the crimes of the guilty world, and by the pouring out of the deluge didst give a figure of regeneration, that one and the same element might in a mystery be the end of vice and the beginning of virtue. Look, O Lord, on the face of Thy Church, and multiply in her Thy regenerations, who by the streams of Thine abundant grace fillest Thy city with joy, and openest the font of Baptism all over the world for the renewal of the Gentiles: that by the command of Thy Majesty she may receive the grace of Thine only Son from the Holy Ghost.
! Here the celebrant, with outstretched hand, divides the water in the form of a cross, and wiping his hand with a towel, says:
v. May He by a secret mixture of His divine virtue render this water fruitful for the regeneration of men, to the end that a heavenly offspring, conceived by sanctification, may emerge from the immaculate womb of this divine font, reborn a new creature: and may all, however distinguished either by sex in body, or by age in time, be brought forth to the same infancy by grace, their mother. Therefore may all unclean spirits, by Thy command, O Lord, depart far from hence: may the whole malice of diabolical deceit be entirely banished: may no power of the enemy prevail here: let him not fly about to lay his snares; may he not creep in by stealth: may he not corrupt with his poison.
v. May this holy and innocent creature be free from all the assaults of the enemy, and purified by the destruction of all his wickedness. May it be a living fountain, a regenerating water, a purifying stream: that all those that are to be washed in this saving bath may obtain, by the operation of the Holy Ghost, the grace of a perfect cleansing.
_`
! He makes the Sign of the Cross over the water three times, and continues:
v. Therefore, I bless thee, O creature of water, by the living + God, by the true + God, by the holy + God: by that God Who, in the beginning, separated thee by His Word from the dry land, Whose Spirit moved over thee.
_`
! Here he divides the water and casts some toward the four corners of the earth, saying:
v. Who made thee flow from the fountain of paradise and commanded thee to water the whole earth with thy four rivers. Who, changing thy bitterness in the desert into sweetness made thee fit to drink, and produced thee out of a rock to quench the thirsty people. I bless + thee also by our Lord Jesus Christ, His only Son: Who in Cana of Galilee changed thee into wine by a wonderful miracle of His power. Who walked upon thee with dry foot, and was baptized in thee by John in the Jordan. Who made thee flow out of His side together with His Blood, and commanded His disciples that such as believed should be baptised in thee, saying: Go, teach all nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
! He changes his voice and proceeds in the tone of the Lesson.
v.Do thou, almighty God, mercifully assist us who observe this commandment: do Thou graciously inspire us.
! He breathes on the water three times in the shape of the Cross.
v. Do Thou with Thy mouth bless these clear waters: that besides their natural virtue of cleansing the body, they may also prove efficacious for the purifying of the soul.
! He lowers the Paschal candle into the water, and sings in the tone of the Preface:
v. May the virtue of the Holy Ghost descend into all the water of this font.
! Withdrawing the candle from the water, he lowers it again to a greater depth and repeats in a higher tone Descendat in hanc. Withdrawing it yet again, he again lowers it to the bottom of the vessel, repeating in yet a higher tone Descendat in hanc. Then breathing upon the water three times in the form of the Greek letter &Psi; he repeats the following verse three times:
v. And make the whole substance of this water fruitful for regeneration.
! Here the Paschal candle is taken out of the water, and he continues:
v. Here may the stains of all sins be washed out; here may human nature, created in Thine image, and reformed to the honor of its Author, be cleansed from all the filth of the old man: that all who receive the Sacrament of regeneration, may be born again new children of true innocence. 
_
v. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son: Who shall come to judge the living and the dead, and the world by fire.
R. Amen.
_
! People are sprinkled with the newly blessed water. The proest pours some of the oil of cathechumens into the water in the form of cross saying:
v. May this font be sanctified and made fruitful with the oil of salvation for all them who shall be born anew of its waters unto life everlasting.
R. Amen.
_
! In same manner pouring in chrism he says:
v. May this pouring in the chrism of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, the comforter, be made in the name of the Holy Trinity.
R. Amen.
_
! Pouring the oil and the chrism together into the water in the form of cross saying:
v. Let this mindling of the chrism of santification, with the oil of unction, and of the water of Baptism, be likewise made in the name of the Father + and of the Son + and of the Holy + Ghost.
R. Amen.
_
! He mingles the oil itself with the waterand with bis hands spreads it through the whole font. If there be any of receive baptism, baptizes them.

Lesson from the Epistle of Blessed Paul the Apostle to the Colossians. 
!Col 3:1-4
Brethren, if you be risen with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God: mind the things that are above, not the things that are upon the earth. For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ should appear, who is your life, then you also shall appear with Him in glory.

!Matt 28:1-7
And in the end of the Sabbath, when it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalen and the other Mary to see the sepulchre. And behold there was a great earthquake. For an Angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and coming, rolled back the stone and sat upon it: and his countenance was as lightening and his raiment as snow. And for fear of him the guards were struck with terror and became as dead men. And the Angel answering, said to the women: Fear not you: for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified: He is not here: for His is risen, as He said. Come and see the place where the Lord was laid. And going quickly, tell ye His disciples that He is risen: and behold He will go before you into Galilee: there you shall see Him. Lo, I have foretold it to you.

v. Accept, O holy Father, almighty and eternal God, this unspotted host, which I, Thy unworthy servant, offer unto Thee, my living and true God, for my innumerable sins, offenses, and negligences, and for all here present: as also for all faithful Christians, both living and dead, that it may avail both me and them for salvation unto life everlasting. Amen.
_
_
! Making the Sign of the Cross with the paten, he places the host upon the corporal. He pours wine and water into the chalice, blessing the water before it is mixed. He pours a few drops of water into the chalice containing wine, in remembrance of the water and blood which flowed from the side of Jesus when pierced by the soldier's lance.
v. O God, who, in creating human nature, didst wonderfully dignify it, and still more wonderfully restore it, grant that, by the Mystery of this water and wine, we may be made partakers of His divine nature, who vouchsafed to be made partaker of our human nature, even Jesus Christ our Lord, Thy Son, who with Thee, liveth and reigneth in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God: world without end. Amen.
_

! The priest makes the Sign of the Cross with the chalice, places it upon the corporal, and covers it with the pall. Then, with his hands joined upon the Altar, and slightly bowing down, he says:
v. Accept us, O Lord, in the spirit of humility and contrition of heart, and grant that the sacrifice which we offer this day in Thy sight may be pleasing to Thee, O Lord God.
! Raising his eyes towards heaven, extending and then joining his hands, the priest makes the Sign of the Cross over the host and the chalice, while he invokes the Holy Spirit.
v. Come, O almighty and eternal God, the Sanctifier, and bless + this Sacrifice, prepared for the glory of Thy holy Name.

! Receiving the thurible from the deacon, the priest incenses the bread and the wine, while he says:
v. May this incense, which Thou hast blessed, O Lord, ascend to Thee, and may Thy mercy descend upon us.
! Then he incenses the altar, saying:
!Ps. 140, 2-4.
v. Let my prayer, O Lord, be directed as incense in Thy sight: the lifting up of my hands as an evening sacrifice.
Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth, and a door round about my lips. May my heart not incline to evil words, to make excuses for sins.
! Giving the censor to the deacon, he says:
v. May the Lord enkindle within us the fire of His love, and the flame of everlasting charity. Amen.
! The priest is then incensed by the deacon, who then incenses the others in order.
_
_
! The priest washes his fingers to symbolize the great purity and inner cleanliness of those who offer or participate in this great Sacrifice.
!Psalm 25. 6-12
v. I will wash my hands among the innocent: and I will compass Thine altar, O Lord That I may hear the voice of praise: and tell of all Thy wonderous works. I have loved, O Lord, the beauty of Thy house and the place where Thy glory dwelleth. Take not away my soul, O God, with the wicked: nor my life with blood-thirsty men. In whose hands are iniquities, their right hand is filled with gifts. But I have walked in my innocence: redeem me, and have mercy on me. My foot hath stood in the direct way, in the churches I will bless Thee, O Lord.

! Bowing down before the middle of the altar, the priest, with joined hands, says:
v. Receive, O holy Trinity, this oblation which we make to Thee, in memory of the Passion, Resurrection and Ascension of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in honor of Blessed Mary, ever Virgin, blessed John the Baptist, the holy Apostles Peter and Paul, and of all the Saints, that it may avail unto their honor and our salvation, and may they vouchsafe to intercede for us in heaven, whose memory we celebrate on earth. Through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.

S. May the Lord receive the Sacrifice from thy hands, to the praise and glory of His Name, to our benefit and that of all His holy Church.
! The priest answers in a low voice:
P. Amen.
