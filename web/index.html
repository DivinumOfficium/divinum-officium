                <p style="text align:center">This website was created and designed by the late
                Laszlo Kiss. Mr. Kiss, longtime resident of Forrest Lake, Illinois, died
                suddenly at his home on Monday, 11 July 2011, shortly after returning
                from a walk with his wife Marta. He was three days shy of his 73rd
                birthday. Mr. Kiss was born in Budapest, Hungary, on 14 July 1938, and
                married Marta Noske on 31 January 1968. He worked in Budapest as a
                computer engineer until emigrating to the United States of America in
                1982. In 1983, he developed “Image,” one of the first computer-controlled
                manufacturing systems in the world (still in use to this day). He retired
                in 2000, and, among other things, selflessly devoted hundreds of hours to
                creating this website, which provides free access to many different versions of the Divine Office (or <em>breviary</em>), the
                traditional daily prayer book of the Roman Catholic Church. His funeral
                was held at St. Peter's Catholic Church in Volo, Illinois, on the Feast
                of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel (16 July). Mr. Kiss is survived by three
                brothers in Hungary, and in the States by his loving wife Marta (of
                forty-three years), their two sons Zoltan and Chaba, and their two
                grandchildren Sophie and Ryan.</p>

                <p style="text align:center">On Monday, 15 August 2011, the Solemnity of the
                Assumption of Our Lady, The Divinum Officium Project was founded, with
                the permission of Laszlo's son Chaba, to preserve and further Laszlo's
                work and to promote the worship of the Triune God through the Divine
                Office. This website serves as a historical, educational, as well as spiritual 
                tool for anyone to learn about this monument of Christian civilization. 
                Currently, The Divinum Officium Project consists of a diocesan priest as well 
                as a team of software developers who maintain the site and
                ensure its accuracy. We are always happy to welcome new volunteers who 
                are familiar with the Church's rites and/or Perl programming. Please see our
                <a href="https://github.com/DivinumOfficium/divinum-officium">GitHub repository</a>
                for further information or contact us at the above address.</p>
