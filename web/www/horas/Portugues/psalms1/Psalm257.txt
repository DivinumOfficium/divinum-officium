(Canticum Jeremiae * Jer 17:7-8)
17:7 Blessed be the man that trusteth in the Lord, * and the Lord shall be his confidence.
17:8 And he shall be as a tree that is planted by the waters, that spreadeth out its roots towards moisture: * and it shall not fear when the heat cometh.
17:8 And the leaf thereof shall be green, and in the time of drought it shall not be solicitous, * neither shall it cease at any time to bring forth fruit.
