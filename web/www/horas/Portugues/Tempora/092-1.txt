Lesson from the book of Job
!Job 27:1-5
1 Job also added, taking up his parable, and said:
2 As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment, and the Almighty, who hath brought my soul to bitterness,
3 As long as breath remaineth in me, and the spirit of God in my nostrils,
4 My lips shall not speak iniquity, neither shall my tongue contrive lying.
5 God forbid that I should judge you to be just: till I die I will not depart from my innocence.

[Lectio2]
!Job 27:6-10
6 My justification, which I have begun to hold, I will not forsake: for my heart doth not reprehend me in all my life.
7 Let my enemy be as the ungodly, and my adversary as the wicked one.
8 For what is the hope of the hypocrite if through covetousness he take by violence, and God deliver not his soul?
9 Will God hear his cry, when distress shall come upon him?
10 Or can he delight himself in the Almighty, and call upon God at all times?

[Lectio3]
!Job 27:11-15
11 I will teach you by the hand of God, what the Almighty hath, and I will not conceal it.
12 Behold you all know it, and why do you speak vain things without cause?
13 This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the inheritance of the violent, which they shall receive of the Almighty.
14 If his sons be multiplied, they shall be for the sword, and his grandsons shall not be filled with bread.
15 They that shall remain of him, shall be buried in death, and his widows shall not weep.
