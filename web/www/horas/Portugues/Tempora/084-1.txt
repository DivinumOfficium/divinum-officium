Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus
!Sir 1:22-26
22 The fear of the Lord is a crown of wisdom, filling up peace and the fruit of salvation:
23 And it hath seen, and numbered her: but both are the gifts of God.
24 Wisdom shall distribute knowledge, and understanding of prudence: and exalteth the glory of them that hold her.
25 The root of wisdom is to fear the Lord: and the branches thereof are longlived.
26 In the treasures of wisdom is understanding, and religiousness of knowledge: but to sinners wisdom is an abomination

[Lectio2]
!Sir 1:27-33
27 The fear of the Lord driveth out sin:
28 For he that is without fear, cannot be justified: for the wrath of his high spirits is his ruin.
29 A patient man shall bear for a time, and afterwards joy shall be restored to him.
30 A good understanding will hide his words for a time, and the lips of many shall declare his wisdom.
31 In the treasures of wisdom is the signification of discipline:
32 But the worship of God is an abomination to a sinner.
33 Son, if thou desire wisdom, keep justice, and God will give her to thee

[Lectio3]
!Sir 1:34-40
34 For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and discipline: and that which is agreeable to him,
35 Is faith, and meekness: and he will fill up his treasures.
36 Be not incredulous to the fear of the Lord: and come not to him with a double heart.
37 Be not a hypocrite in the sight of men, and let not thy lips be a stumblingblock to thee.
38 Watch over them, lest thou fall, and bring dishonour upon thy soul,
39 And God discover thy secrets, and cast thee down in the midst of the congregation.
40 Because thou camest to the Lord wickedly, and thy heart is full of guile and deceit.
