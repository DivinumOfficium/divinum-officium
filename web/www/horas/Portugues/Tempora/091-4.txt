Lesson from the book of Job
!Job 4:1-6
1 Then Eliphaz the Themanite answered, and said:
2 If we begin to speak to thee, perhaps thou wilt take it ill, but who can withhold the words he hath conceived?
3 Behold thou hast taught many, and thou hast strengthened the weary hands:
4 thy words have confirmed them that were staggering, and thou hast strengthened the trembling knees:
5 But now the scourge is come upon thee, and thou faintest: it hath touched thee, and thou art troubled.
6 Where is thy fear, thy fortitude, thy patience, and the perfection of thy ways?

10 The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the lioness, and the teeth of the whelps of lions are broken:
11 The tiger hath perished for want of prey, and the young lions are scattered abroad.

17 Shall man be justified in comparison of God, or shall a man be more pure than his maker?
18 Behold they that serve him are not steadfast, and in his angels he found wickedness:
