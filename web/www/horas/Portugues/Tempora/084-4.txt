Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus
!Sir 3:22-26
22 Seek not the things that are too high for thee, and search not into things above thy ability: but the things that God hath commanded thee, think on them always, and in many of his works be not curious.
23 For it is not necessary for thee to see with thy eyes those things that are hid.
24 In unnecessary matters be not over curious, and in many of his works thou shalt not be inquisitive.
25 For many things are shown to thee above the understanding of men.
26 And the suspicion of them hath deceived many, and hath detained their minds in vanity.

[Lectio2]
!Sir 3:27-30
27 A hard heart shall fear evil at the last: and he that loveth danger shall perish in it.
28 A heart that goeth two ways shall not have success, and the perverse of heart shall be scandalized therein.
29 A wicked heart shall be laden with sorrows, and the sinner will add sin to sin.
30 The congregation of the proud shall not be healed: for the plant of wickedness shall take root in them, and it shall not be perceived.

[Lectio3]
!Sir 3:31-34
31 The heart of the wise is understood in wisdom, and a good ear will hear wisdom with all desire.
32 A wise heart, and which hath understanding, will abstain from sins, and in the works of justice shall have success.
33 Water quencheth a flaming fire, and alms resisteth sins:
34 And God provideth for him that showeth favour: he remembereth him afterwards, and in the time of his fall he shall find a sure stay.
