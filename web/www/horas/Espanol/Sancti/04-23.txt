The martyr George beareth among the Easterns the title of the holy and glorious~
Archmartyr. He suffered a glorious death, for Christ's sake, in the persecution~
under Diocletian. When peace was given to the Church soon after, under~
Constantine, the memory of the martyr began to be celebrated, and churches were~
built under his invocation at Lydda in Palestine and at Constantinople. For~
thenceforth an extraordinary enthusiasm with regard to him grew up among the~
faithful, first in all parts of the East, and afterwards in the West. Of old~
time, when Christian armies had been about to fight, they have been used to call~
as patrons upon holy George, Maurice, and Sebastian. There had been already~
special honour paid in England to the holy martyr George, and the supreme~
Pontiff Benedict XIV declared him the protector of the whole kingdom.
