From the holy Gospel according to Mark
!Mark 16:15-18
Abban az időben így szolt Jézus tanitványaihoz: Menjetek el az egész világra, és~
hirdessétek az evangéliumot minden teremtménynek. És így tovább.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great.) 
!29th on the Gospels.
By the words every~
creature we may understand every tribe of the Gentiles. Of aforetime it had been~
said, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, (Matth. x. 5,) but now, Preach the~
Gospel to every creature, that, since the Jews had proudly rejected the~
preaching of the Apostles, that might become our gain which was the seal of~
their condemnation. But when the Eternal Truth sendeth forth His disciples to~
preach, what doth He but scatter seed over the field of the world He scattered~
abroad a few grains for seed, that He may afterward reap an abundant harvest in~
our faith.
