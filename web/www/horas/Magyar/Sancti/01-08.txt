Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Mt 2:1-12
Amikor a júdeai Betlehemben Heródes király idejében Jézus megszületett, bölcsek jöttek napkeletről Jeruzsálembe és kérdezősködtek: „Hol van a zsidók újszülött királya?  És így tovább.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great.)
!10th on the Gospels.)
The wise men brought gold, frankincense, and myrrh. Gold is the fitting gift to a King, frankincense is offered in sacrifice to God, and with myrrh are embalmed the bodies of the dead. By the gifts, therefore, which they presented unto Him, the wise men set forth three things concerning Him unto Whom they offered them; by the gold, that He was King; by the frankincense, that He was God; and by the myrrh, that He was to die. There are some heretics who believe Him to be God, but confess not His Kingly dominion over all things; these offer unto Him frankincense, but refuse Him gold. There are some others who admit that He is King, but deny that He is God; these present unto Him gold, but will not give Him frankincense.
