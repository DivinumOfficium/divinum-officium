!Commemoration for the Eve of S. Matthaei.
Evangélium Szt Lukács könyvéböl
!Luke 5:27-32
Jézus kiment, s meglátott egy Lévi nevű vámost, amint a vámnál ült.~
Felszólította: "Kövess engem!" Az felállt, és mindenét otthagyva követte őt. És~
így tovább.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!Book v. Comment, on Luke v.
There is a mystery in this calling of the publican, whom He biddeth to follow~
Him, not so much by bodily steps as by change of heart. Hitherto Levi had been~
making greedy gains from merchandise, cruel riches at the cost of sailors' toils~
and dangers; but now, at the call of a word, he, who had been plundering other~
men's goods, leaveth his own. He leaveth that base station, and followeth hard~
after the Lord with all his heart. And Levi made Him a great feast in his own~
house. He that welcometh Christ into his home, feasteth upon the excellency of~
all pleasures.
