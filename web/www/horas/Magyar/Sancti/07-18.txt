!John 15:12-16
Azon időben így szót Jézus tanítványaihoz: Az az én parancsom, hogy szeressétek egymást, amint én szerettelek benneteket. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop of Hippo.
!83 th Tract on John.)
What think ye, my brethren Is this His only commandment, this, That we love one another Is there not another and a greater, the commandment to love God Or hath God commanded us only to love, so that we need seek to do no more Surely the Apostle commendeth three things: And now abideth Faith, Hope, Charity, these three but the greatest of these is Charity. (1 Cor. xiii. 13.) And although in charity, that is, in love, he included the two first and great commandments, and charity he called the greatest, yet is charity not said to be alone. Concerning Faith, concerning Hope, how much is commanded us Who can gather them all together Who can reckon them all And yet let us consider how the same Apostle saith Love is the fulfilling of the Law. (Rom. xiii. 10.)
