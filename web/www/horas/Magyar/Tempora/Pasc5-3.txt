Evangélium szent János Apostol kőnyvéből
!John 17:1-11
Azon időben Jézus az égre emelte tekintetét, és így imádkozott: "Atyám, elérkezett az óra. Dicsőítsd meg Fiadat És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop of Hippo.
!104th Tract on John.
Our Lord, the Only-begotten and coeternal Son of the Father, was able, if need~
were, in and from the form of a servant, to pray in silence but He thus~
manifested Himself in prayer, remembering that He is our Teacher. Thus He made~
known unto us the prayer which He made for us since He was so great a Master~
that, not only His discourse to them, but His prayer to the Father for them, is~
an up-building to His disciples. And if it was so for them who were there to~
hear, truly it is so for us also for whose instruction it hath been written~
down.
