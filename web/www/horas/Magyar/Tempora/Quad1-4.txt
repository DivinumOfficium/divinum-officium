Evangélium szent Máté könyvéből
!Mt 15:21-28
Azon továbbmenve, Jézus Tírusz és Szidon vidékére vonult vissza. És így tovább.

Homily by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Bk. ii. Comm. on Matth. xv.
Christ leaveth the Scribes and Pharisees who had spoken falsely against Him, and goeth into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, that He may heal the Tyrians and Sidonians. But a woman of Canaan cometh to Him out of the land He had left, and crieth to Him to give health to her daughter. Remark that the case of the daughter of this woman of Canaan is the fifteenth case of healing. Have mercy on me, O Lord, Thou Son of David! She knew that He was to be called Son of David because she was come out of His own country, and had left the errors of the Tyrians and Sidonians when she changed her home and her faith.
