v.  Hiszen ti, okos emberek, engeditek, hogy a balgák megnyerjenek benneteket. Eltûritek, ha valaki szolgává alacsonyít benneteket, ha kifoszt, ha kihasznál, ha fölétek kerekedik, ha arcul üt.

Olvasmány Mózes elsõ könyvébõl
!Gen 5:31; 6:1-4
31 Noé 500 éves volt, akkor nemzette Szemet, Kámot és Jáfetet.
8:1 Amikor az emberek kezdtek elszaporodni a földön és leányaik születtek,
6.2 az Isten fiai látták, hogy az emberek lányai szépek. Feleségül vették mindazokat, akik tetszettek nekik.
6.3 Ekkor az Úr így szólt: "Nem marad éltet&#337; lelkem az emberben örökké, mivel test. Életkora csak 120 év legyen."
6.4 Óriások éltek akkor a földön (és kés&#337;bb is), amikor az Isten fiai az emberek lányaival összeházasodtak, és ezek gyermekeket szültek nekik; ezek a régi id&#337;k híres h&#337;sei.

[Responsory1]
R. The Lord said unto Noah The end of all flesh is come before Me; for the~
earth is filled with violence through them.
* And I will destroy them with the earth.
V. Make thee an ark of planed timber, rooms shalt thou make in it.
R. And I will destroy them with the earth.

[Lectio2]
!Gen 6:5-8
5 Amikor az Úr látta, hogy nagy az emberek gonoszsága a földön és szívük~
állandóan a rosszra irányul,
6 megbánta az Úr, hogy embert teremtett a földön és bánkódott szívében.
7 Ezt mondta az Úr: "Eltörlöm a föld színérõl az embert, akit a földön~
teremtettem: az embert az állatokkal, a csúszómászókkal és az ég madaraival~
együtt, mivel megbántam, hogy teremtettem õket."
8 Noé azonban kegyelmet talált az Úr szemében.

[Responsory2]
R. Noah was a just man and perfect; he walked with God. ]
* According to all that God commanded him, so did he.
V. He made him an ark, that a seed of every sort might be saved alive.
R. According to all that God commanded him, so did he.

[Lectio3]
!Gen 6:9-15
9 Noénak ez a története: Noé igaz ember volt, kifogástalanul élt kortársai~
között. Noé Isten színe elõtt járt.
10 Noénak három fia született: Szem, Kám és Jáfet.
11 A föld azonban romlott volt Isten színe elõtt, s a föld tele volt erõszakkal.
12 Isten látta a földet: romlott volt, mert minden lény a rossz útjára tért.
13 Isten így szólt Noéhoz: "Elhatároztam, hogy elpusztítok minden lényt a földön,~
mivel a föld az emberek miatt megtelt gonoszsággal.
14 Ezért eltörlöm õket a föld színérõl. Építs magadnak bárkát fenyõfából s~
nádfonatból, kívül és belül kend be szurokkal.
15 Így kell építened: 300 könyök legyen a bárka hossza, 50 könyök a szélessége~
és 30 könyök a magassága.

[Responsory3]
R. Forty days and forty nights were the heavens opened; and there went into the~
ark two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life.
* And the Lord shut them in.
V. In the self-same day entered Noah into the ark, and his sons, and his wife,~
and the wives of his sons.
R. And the Lord shut them in.
&Gloria
R. And the Lord shut them in.

From the Book upon Noah's Ark by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!Chap, iv.
We read that the Lord was angry. It is in the thoughts, that is to say, in the~
knowledge of God, that man being put on earth and weighted with the body cannot ~
be without sin, for earth is the home of temptations, and the flesh is a bait~
for corruption. Yet man had a reasonable soul, and his soul had power to control~
his body; and, being so made, he made no struggle to keep himself from falling~
into that from whence he would not return. God's thoughts are not as man's~
thoughts; in Him there is no such thing as change of mind, no such thing as to~
be angry and then cool down again. These things are written that we may know the~
bitterness of our sins, whereby we have earned the Divine wrath. To such a~
degree had iniquity grown that God, Who by His nature cannot be moved by anger,~
or hatred, or any passion whatsoever, is represented as provoked to anger.

[Responsory4]
R. Noah builded an Altar unto the Lord, and offered burnt offerings on the Altar;~
and the Lord smelled a sweet savour, and blessed Noah, and said
* Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.
V. Behold, I establish My covenant with you, and with your seed after you.
R. Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.

[Lectio5]
And God threatened that He would destroy man. He said I will destroy man, whom I~
have created, from the face of the earth; both man and beast, and the creeping~
thing, and the fowls of the air. What harm had the animals done? For man's use~
had they been created, and, when man was wiped away, they were of use no longer.~
And there is an higher reason. Man is a living soul, capable of reason, who may~
be described as a living animal, subject to death, and endowed with reason. When~
then the highest animal is gone, why should the lower branches remain? Why~
should anything be saved alive, when righteousness, the basis of salvation, is~
to be no more?

[Responsory5]
R. The Lord said unto Noah I do set My bow in the clouds of heaven
* And I will remember My covenant which is between Me and you.
V. And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the heaven, that My bow~
shall be seen in the cloud.
R. And I will remember My covenant which is between Me and you.

[Lectio6]
But more effectually to condemn the rest of men, and to manifest the goodness of~
God, it is written that Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord. Here we learn~
also that the sin of his neighbour casteth no shadow on the righteous, when he~
is kept as a stock from whence the whole race are to spring. He is praised, not~
because he was of a noble race, but because he was a just man and perfect. The~
stock of a just man yieldeth men of just souls; for virtues, like blood, are~
hereditary. Among men are some families illustrious for honourable pedigrees,~
and so there are also races of souls whose comeliness is the lustre of virtues.

[Responsory6]
R. By Myself have I sworn, saith the Lord. I will not again bring the waters of~
the flood upon the earth I will remember My covenant.
* And the waters shall become no more a flood to destroy all flesh.
V. I do set My bow in the clouds, and it shall be for a token of a covenant~
between Me and the earth.
R. And the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
&Gloria
R. And the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.

Evangélium szent Lukács Evangélista kõnyvébõl
!Luke 8:4-15
Azon idõben Jézust nagy tömeg vette körül és a városokból tömérdek nép~
zarándokolt hozzá, mondott egy példabeszédet: "Kiment a magvetõ, hogy elvesse a~
magot. És így tovább.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great.)
!5th on the Gospels.)
Dearly beloved brethren, the passage from the Holy Gospel which ye have just~
heard, needeth not so much that I should explain it, as that I should seek to~
enforce its lesson. The Truth Himself hath explained it, and, after that, it~
beseemeth not man's frailty to fritter away His exposition by any further~
comment. But there is, in that very explanation by the Lord, somewhat, which it~
behoveth us well to weigh. If it were but we who bade you believe that by the~
seed is signified the word; by the field, the world; by the birds, the devils;~
and by the thorns, riches ye would perchance doubt of the truth of our~
explanation. Therefore the Lord Himself hath vouchsafed to give this explanation,~
and that, not for this parable only, but that ye may know in what manner to~
interpret others, whereof He hath not given the meaning.

[Responsory7]
R. God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them
* Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.
V. Behold, I establish My covenant with you, and with your seed after you.
R. Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.

[Lectio8]
Beginning His explanation, the Lord saith that He speaketh in parables. Hereby~
He doth certify us, when our weakness would unveil to you the hidden meaning of~
His words. If I spake of myself, who would believe me when I say that riches are~
thorns? Thorns prick, but riches lull to rest. And yet riches are indeed thorns,~
for the anxiety they bring is a ceaseless pricking to the minds of their owners,~
and, if they lead into sin, they are thorns which bloodily tear the soul. But we~
understand from another Evangelist (Matth. xiii. 22) that in this place the Lord~
speaketh, not of riches themselves, but of the deceitfulness of riches.

[Responsory8]
R. Behold, I establish My covenant with you, and with your seed after you.
* Neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
V. I do set My bow in the clouds, and it shall be for a token of a covenant~
between Me and the earth.
R. Neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.

[Lectio9]
Those riches are deceitful riches, which can be ours only for a little while;~
those riches are deceitful riches, which cannot relieve the poverty of our~
souls. They are the only true riches, which make us rich in virtues. If then,~
dearly beloved brethren, ye seek to be rich, earnestly desire the true riches.~
If ye would be truly honourable, strive after the kingdom of heaven. If ye love~
the bravery of titles, hasten to have your names written down at Court above,~
where Angels are. Take to heart the Lord's words which your ear heareth. The~
food of the soul is the word of God when the stomach is sick it throweth up~
again the food which is put into it, and so is the soul sick when a man heareth~
and digesteth not in his memory the Word of God. And if any man cannot keep his~
food, that man's life is in desperate case.

[Responsory9]
R. When much people were gathered together to Jesus, and were come to Him out of~
every city, He spake by a parable
* A sower went out to sow his seed.
V. And, as he sowed, some fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an~
hundred-fold.
R. A sower went out to sow his seed.
&Gloria
R. A sower went out to sow his seed.

[Ant Laudes]
Have mercy upon me, O God, * after thy great mercy.
If the Lord be my Saviour * I will not fear what man can do unto me.
Within the veil I cried betimes * O God, Thou art my God, early will I seek thee.
Let us sing praises * to the Lord our God.
In the high places, * praise ye God.

[Capitulum Laudes]
!2 Cor 11:19-20

R. From generation to generation.

$Deo gratias

[Ant Sexta]
Some seed fell on good ground, * and bare fruit, some an hundred-fold, and some~
sixty-fold.

[Capitulum Sexta]
!2 Cor 11:25
v. Háromszor megbotoztak, egyszer megköveztek. Háromszor szenvedtem hajótörést,~
egy nap és egy éjjel a nyílt tengeren hányódtam.

[Ant Nona]
If then, dearly beloved brethren, ye seek to be rich, * earnestly desire the~
true riches.

[Capitulum Nona]
!2 Cor 12:9
v. Ezért a legszívesebben a gyöngeségeimmel dicsekszem, hogy Krisztus ereje~
költözzön belém.
$Deo gratias

[Ant 3]
Jesus said to His disciples * Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of~
the kingdom of God, but to others in parables.

[Versum 3]
V. Let my prayer, O Lord, be set forth.
R. As incense before thee.
