!John 12:10-36
Azon időben a főpapok elhatározták, hogy Lázárt is megölik, mert miatta sok zsidó elment oda, és hitt Jézusban. És így tovább.

Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo)
!50th Tract on John.
When they saw Lazarus who had been raised from the dead, and knew that the miracle which the Lord had worked was so great, spread about by so many witnesses, and so plain and manifest that it could neither be concealed nor denied, they invented an expedient; and see here what it was--”But the chief Priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death.” What stupidity of thought, what blindness of cruelty is here! If the Lord Christ had raised up again a man who had died a natural death, could He not also raise up one that had died by violence? Would killing Lazarus paralyse the Lord? But if ye consider that there is a difference between a man dead of disease, and a man killed, behold, the Lord hath raised up both for He first raised up Lazarus, who had died a natural death, and then Himself, after a violent one.
