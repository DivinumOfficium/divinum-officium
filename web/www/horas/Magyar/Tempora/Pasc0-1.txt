!Luke 24:13-35
Azon időben ketten közülük még aznap elindultak egy Emmausz nevű helységbe És így tovább.

Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great)
!23rd on the Gospels.
Dearly beloved brethren, ye hear, how that while two of His disciples walked together in the way, not believing in His Resurrection, but talking, together concerning Him, the Lord manifested Himself unto them, but yet held their eyes that they should not know Him. This holding of the eyes of their body, wrought by the Lord, was a figure of the spiritual veil which was yet upon the eyes of their heart. For in their heart they loved and yet doubted : even as the Lord drew near to them outwardly, but showed not Who He was. To them that talked together of Him, He f revealed His immediate presence; but hid, from them that doubted, the knowledge of His Person.
