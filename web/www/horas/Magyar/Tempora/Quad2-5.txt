Evangélium szent Máté könyvéből
!Mt 21:33-46
Azon időben mondá Jézus a zsidók seregeinek: Halljatok egy másik példabeszédet. Volt egy gazda, aki szőlőt telepített. Bekerítette sövénnyel És így tovább.

Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!Bk. ix. on Luke xx.
Many derive divers spiritual meanings from the term vineyard, but Isaias giveth us to know that the vineyard of the Lord of Sabaoth is the house of Israel, (v. 7.) Who but God planted that vineyard? He it was that let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country; not that the Lord, Who is everywhere present, moveth from place to place; but because He is nigh unto them that seek Him, and from such as regard Him not He standeth afar off. For a long time He tarried away, lest He might seem to ask too early for the fruits of His vineyard. For where kindness is greatest, there ingratitude is worst.
