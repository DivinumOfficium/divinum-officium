Evangélium szent János Apostol kőnyvéből
!John 10:1-10
Azon időben mondá Jézus a farizeusoknak: "Bizony, bizony, mondom nektek: Aki nem a kapun megy be a juhok aklába, hanem máshonnan hatol be, az tolvaj és rabló. Aki a kapun megy be, az a juhok pásztora. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop of Hippo.
!45 th Tract on John.
In the words of the Gospel which are this day read, the Lord has spoken unto us in similitudes, touching His flock, and the Door whereby entry is made into their fold. The Pagans therefore may say, "We have good lives," but if they enter not in the Door, what doth that profit them whereof they make their boast good life is profitable to a man if lead unto life everlasting, but if he not to have life everlasting, what shall his good life profit him Neither indeed can it be truly said that they live good lives, who are either so blinded as not to know, or so puffed up as to despise, the end of a good life. And no man can* have a true and certain hope of life everlasting, unless he know the true Life, Which is Christ, and enter in by that Door into the sheepfold.
