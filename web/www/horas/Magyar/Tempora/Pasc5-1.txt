Evangélium szent Lukács Evangélista kőnyvéből
!Luke 11:5-13
Azon időben mondá Jézus tanítványainak: Aztán így folytatta: "Mondjuk, hogy valamelyiteknek van egy barátja, és az éjfélkor bekopog hozzá ezekkel a szavakkal: Barátom, adj kölcsön nekem három kenyeret. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop of Milan.
!Book vii. on Luke xi.
We gather from this commandment, among other things, that we ought to pray, not only by day, but also by night. Thou seest how that he which arose at midnight to ask three loaves of his friend, and endured in supplication, was not disappointed of that which he sought. Of what are these three loaves a figure, but of that our Mysterious Bread Which cometh down from heaven Thou seest that if thou lovest the Lord thy God, thou mayest win His bounty, not only for thyself, but for others likewise. And who can deserve more to be called our "Friend" than He Which gave His Own Body for us
