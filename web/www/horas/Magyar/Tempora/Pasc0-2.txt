!Luke 24:36-47
Azon időben egyszer csak megjelent köztük és köszöntötte őket: Békesség nektek, én vagyok, Ne féljetek. És így tovább.

Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!Bk. x. Comm. on Luke xxiv.
We see here the marvellous nature of the Lord's glorified Body. It could enter unseen, and then become seen. It could easily be touched, but Its nature is hard to understand. The disciples were affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit. And therefore the Lord, that He might show us the evidence of His Resurrection, said: Handle Me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see Me have. Therefore it was not by being in a disembodied state, but by the peculiar qualities of the risen and glorified Body that He had passed through closed doors. (John xx. 19.) For that which is touched or handled is a body.
