Evangélium szent János könyvéből
!John 8:12-20
Azon időben mondá Jézus a zsidók seregeinek: Én vagyok a világ világossága. Aki~
követ, nem jár többé sötétségben, hanem övé lesz az élet világossága. És így~
tovább.

Homily on this passage by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!34 Tract on John.
I take it that these words of the Lord I am the Light of the world are~
sufficiently clear to all men who have eyes which see that Light. At the same~
time, such men as have no eyes except those which are in their bodies, are~
surprised to find our Lord Jesus Christ saying, I am the Light of the world. And~
that we might not want somebody to say, Is our Lord Jesus Christ, then, the same~
sun that riseth and setteth every day? there have actually been heretics who did~
say it. The Manichasans believed that that sun which we see with our bodily eyes,~
and to see which is plain and common to beasts as well as men, was the Lord~
Christ.
