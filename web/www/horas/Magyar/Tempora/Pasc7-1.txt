Evangélium szent János Apostol kőnyvéből
!John 3:16-21
Azon időben mondá Jézus Nicodémusnak: Mert úgy szerette Isten a világot, hogy egyszülött Fiát adta oda, hogy aki hisz benne, az el ne vesszen, hanem örökké éljen. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop of Hippo
!12th Tract on John
The Physician cometh that, as often as in him lieth, he may heal the sick man. He is his own destroyer who will not keep the commandments of the Physician.~
Into the world came the Saviour. Why is He called the Saviour of the world but because He came "into the world not to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved"? If thou wiliest not be saved through Him, thou wilt be condemned of thyself. And why say I that thou wilt be condemned Because it is written " He that believeth in Him is not condemned." What then canst thou hope that He will say of " him that believeth not," but that He will be condemned And indeed He doth say farther " He that believeth not is condemned already." He is con, demned already, though the condemnation be not yet openly pronounced.
