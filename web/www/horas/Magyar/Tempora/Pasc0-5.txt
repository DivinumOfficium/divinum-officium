Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 28:16-20.
Azon időben a tizenegy tanítvány elment Galileába, arra a hegyre, ahova Jézus rendelte őket. És így tovább.

Homily by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Bk. iv. Comm. o?i the end of Matth.
After His Resurrection Jesus was seen on a mountain in Galilee, and there He was worshipped; and, albeit some doubted, their doubts have led to a further establishing of our faith. Then He showed Himself more openly unto Thomas, and made him handle the Side That was pierced with the spear, and the Hands wherein were the holes of the nails. And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying : All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth. Yea, all power is given unto Him Who but a little while before had been crucified, and buried in the grave, and had lain among the dead, but Who also had risen again. Power is given unto Him in heaven and in earth, that He Who of everlasting had been King of heaven, might have a Monarchy on earth also, through the faith of them which believe in Him.
