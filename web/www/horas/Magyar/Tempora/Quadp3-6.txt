!Mark 6:47-56
Azon időben amikor besötétedett a bárka mélyen bent járt a tavon. Ő ott maradt egyedül a parton. És így tovább.

!Bk. ii. cap. 6, on Mark vi. 45
The toil of the disciples in rowing, and the wind contrary to them, is a figure of the divers toils of the Holy Church, as, amid the waves of a world that fighteth against her, and the stormy blasts of unclean spirits, she laboureth to reach the rest of her Fatherland above, as a shore safe for her anchor. Here also it is well said that the ship was in the midst of the sea, and He alone on the land; for sometimes it cometh to pass that the Church is, by the great pressure of the Gentiles, not only so afflicted, but also befouled, that it seemeth as though, if it were possible, her Redeemer had for the time forsaken her.
