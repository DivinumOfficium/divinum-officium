The programlet comes up with the page:<BR><BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="mainpage.png" ALT="main page"></CENTER><BR><BR>
<span class=prm>The first line</span> shows the day's Office (or that which is selected), 
<span class=prma>the second line</span> (if any) is
the Office which is commemorated, or the Scripture which is read at Matins that day. In the top line, feasts are shown in red; vigils and offices of Our Lady in blue; and that of a feria, simplex or commemoration in black.<BR><BR>
In the next line, the widget after the title allows to reset the <span class=prm>date</span>.
The programlet always comes up with the <SPAN class=prma>current date,</span> but you may 
select a different date by pressing
<UL><LI> <FONT COLOR=BLUE> &darr; </FONT> down arrow for the previous day;
<LI> <FONT COLOR=BLUE> &uarr; </FONT> up arrow for the next day;
<LI> or by typing in a new date.
</UL>
After the change you must press the button next to the widget to obtain the new Office.<BR><BR>
The images in the main table serve only remind the reader that the Office is collected from the
<UL>
<LI>Ordinarium = the frame of the Hours;
<LI>Psalterium = the Psalms, forming the main portion of the Hour;
<LI>Proprium de Tempore	= the days as they are part of the seasons of the Church year;
<LI>Proprium Sanctorum = the feasts of the saints;
<LI>Commune Sanctorum = the common part of the offices for the saints.
</UL>

You may find further details at the
<A HREF=brevitechnical.html>Technical Information</A> or 
<A HREF=rubrics.html>Rubrics</A> pages.<BR><BR>

The eight <span class=prm>buttons</span> in blue show the eight hours of the traditional Divine Office;
you may select one by clicking on the tab. If you recite the hours in sequence
(and your browser allows cookies) then the already-completed hours will be listed 
in the same color as the titles.<BR><BR>

Since you have arrived at this page, you have already used the <span class=prm>Help</span> button from
the bottom. Try clicking the <span class=prm>Options</span> button to find the following table:<BR><BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="setup.png" ALT="options"></CENTER><BR><BR>

Check or uncheck the priest box, so you will recite the <I>Dominus vobiscum</I> or the <I>Domine exaudi</I>
as appropriate.<BR>
If you check the <B>Building script</B> box, the program will make a list at the bottom 
how the Office for the hour was composed.<BR>
<B>Language</B> selects the language for the first column.<BR>
You may select <B>white or grey background</B> for the tables of the individual hours.<BR>
The structure of the <B>colors</B> input is: -relative size  [bold] [italic] foreground color.<BR>
If the starting page image extends far beyond the screen, set <B>screen height</B> to a smaller value.
<BR><BR></FONT>

Click <span class=prma>OK</span> 
to get to the main table again. If your computer allows cookies, this values and the
ones on the bottom row will be saved for the next session.<BR><BR>
The five selectors on the <span class=prm>bottom row</span> allows you to control how the
Hours are rendered.<BR><BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="selectors.png" ALT="selector"></CENTER><BR><BR>

The first selector displays the Office in different formats.<BR><BR>
To <span class=prm>pray</span> the hour, please select any mode other than skeleton:<BR>
<UL>
<LI><span class=prm>all</span> prints everything, including the common prayers. (Default)
<LI><span class=prm>psalms</span> only indicates the common prayers.
<LI><span class=prm>nothing</span> prints only the Ordinarium; the psalms, lections and other longer items are only indicated.
<LI><span class=prm>skeleton</span> prints only the structure of the Hour.
</UL>
For instance, click now on the leftmost selector, choosing <span class=prma>skeleton</span> and click on the
<span class=prm>Completorium</span> button.<BR><BR>

The programlet shows the skeleton of the easiest-to-compose <span class=prm>Hour</span>, that of Compline.<BR><BR>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="compskel.png" ALT="completorium-skeleton"></CENTER><BR><BR>


If you select "Psalms", this will result: <BR><BR>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="horastable.png" ALT="horastable"></CENTER><BR><BR>

<UL>
<LI>Click the button next to the indicated element in the Hour, and the text will come up in a separate window as a <span class=prma>popup</span>. The picture shows the <span class=prma>Pater Noster</span> as popup.<BR><BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="expandedpopup.png" ALT="expanded and popup"></CENTER><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>
<LI>In any selection, clicking on <B>Top</B> brings the cell to the top, <B>Next</B> brings the next cell to the top.<BR><BR>
<LI>The number in the right cell is for reference.<BR><BR>
<LI>If you click on any <span class=prma>radio button</span> next to the section title,
that part will be expanded. Click an another to change the expanded part, or on the same
section's button again, to contract the expansion.<BR><BR>
</UL>
The second selector chooses the rubrical structure, of which 7 options are provided. The programlet defaults to the 1960 rubrics.<BR><BR>
The third selector selects "Regular" or "Seasonal" mode, which in certain cases will allow one to pray the Office of the season as opposed to that of the day. See <a href='versions.html'>Versions</a> for details.<BR><BR>
The fourth selector designates the language in which the Office is displayed in the right-hand column. If a translation is not fully available in a particular language, the second column in the displayed Office will default to English text. If you select the same language as the first column, only that language will 
be displayed in a single column.<BR><BR>
The fifth selector permits a choice from among several votive Offices, such as the Officium Defunctorum or the Officium Parvum of the Blessed Virgin Mary.<BR><BR>
Within the text:<BR>
<UL>
<LI><IMG SRC="../cross1.gif" ALT="cross1"> stands for the regular Sign of the Cross (forehead, breast, left, then right shoulder).<BR>
<LI><IMG SRC="../cross2.gif" ALT="cross2"> stands for making a cross with your thumb on your lips.<BR>
<LI><IMG SRC="../cross3.gif" ALT="cross3"> stands for making a cross with your thumb on your breast.<BR>
</LI><BR>
You may also change the date by clicking on <span class=prm>Kalendar</span> tab. The Kalendar is divided in two columns: the Proprium de Tempore and the Proprium Sanctorum. On a given day, the side which is displayed in bold-face type represents the correct Office for that day in a specific rubrical structure (i.e. Rubrics 1960).<BR><BR> 
One can select another <B>date</B> by clicking the day of the month in the first column. Also, you may
change the <B>year</B> or <B>month</B> at the top, or the rubrical structure (1570, 1910, etc.) at the bottom of the page.<BR><BR>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="kalendar.png" ALT="kalendar"></CENTER><BR><BR>

If Divinum Officium has been downloaded to one's computer as a local web host (or via GitHub), it is possible to edit the individual files.<BR><BR>

It is our hope that this programlet will help everyone to understand the Divine Office better,
and help people to start to pray fully (or at least partially) the <I>Breviarium Romanum</I> on a daily basis.
