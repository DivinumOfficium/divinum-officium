<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH=90% BORDER=0 BGCOLOR='white' CELLSPACING=12><TR><TD>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR=MAROON>Getting Started</FONT></H2>
Divinum Officium Desktop displays:<BR><BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="mainpage.png" width="75%" ALT="main page"></CENTER><BR><BR>
<span class=prm>The first line</span> shows the day's Office (or that which is selected), 
<span class=prma>the second line</span> (if any) is
the Office which is commemorated, or the Scripture which is read at Matins that day. In the top line, the title of the liturgical day is shown in a color correlating to the feast, feria, etc. However, vigils and offices of Our Lady are shown in <font color="blue">blue</FONT>; for contrast, feasts which are celebrated in white are given in <B>black</B>, and offices of the dead are shown in <font color="grey">grey</FONT>.<BR><BR>
In the next line, the widget after the title allows to reset the <span class=prm>date</span>.
The date selector always appears with the <SPAN class=prma>current date,</span> but you may select a different date by pressing
<UL><LI> <FONT COLOR=BLUE> &darr; </FONT> down arrow for the previous day;
<LI> <FONT COLOR=BLUE> &uarr; </FONT> up arrow for the next day;
<LI> or by typing in a new date.
</UL>
After the change you must press the button next to the widget to obtain the new Office.<BR><BR>
Divinum Officium Mobile offers a slightly simpler interface, without the date selector, but does include the up and down arrows to choose a date.<BR><BR>
The images in the main table serve only to remind the reader that the Office is collected from the
<UL>
<LI><I>Ordinarium</I> = the frame of the Hours;
<LI><I>Psalterium</I> = the Psalms, forming the main portion of the Hour;
<LI><I>Proprium de Tempore</I>	= the days as they are part of the seasons of the Church year;
<LI><I>Proprium Sanctorum</I> = the feasts of the saints;
<LI><I>Commune Sanctorum</I> = the common part of the offices for the saints.
</UL>
You may find further details at the <A HREF=technical.html>Technical Information</A> or <A HREF=rubrics.html>Rubrics</A> pages.<BR><BR>
The eight <span class=prm>buttons</span> in blue show the eight hours of the traditional Divine Office;
you may select one by clicking on the tab. If you recite the hours in sequence
(and your browser allows cookies) then the already-completed hours will be listed 
in the same color as the titles.<BR><BR>

Since you have arrived at this page, you have already used the <span class=prm>Help</span> button from
the bottom. Try clicking the <span class=prm>Options</span> button to find the following table:<BR><BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="setup.png" ALT="options"></CENTER><BR><BR>

Check or uncheck the <B>Priest</B> box, so you will recite the <I>Dominus vobiscum</I> or the <I>Domine exaudi</I>
as appropriate.<BR>
If you check the <B>Building script</B> box, the program will make a list at the bottom of the page with technical information on
how the Office for the specific hour was composed.<BR>
<B>Language</B> selects the language for the first column. It is possible to display the Office in one modern language only. Select the desired modern language as the option here, and the same language as "Language 2" on the main page.<BR>
<B>Pius XII Psalter</B> gives the option of using the Pius XII/Augustin Cardinal Bea Latin translation of the psalms. More information on this psalter is available <a href="newps1.jpg">here</a> and <a href="newps2.jpg">here</a>.<BR>
You may select <B>white or grey background</B> for the tables of the individual hours.<BR>
The structure of the <B>colors</B> input is: -relative size  [bold] [italic] foreground color.<BR>
If the starting page image extends far beyond the screen, set <B>screen height</B> to a smaller value.
<BR><BR></FONT>

Click <span class=prma>OK</span> 
to get to the main table again. If your computer allows cookies, this values and the
ones on the bottom row will be saved for the next session.<BR><BR>
The four selectors on the <span class=prm>bottom row</span> allows you to control how the
Hours are rendered.<BR><BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="selectors.png" ALT="selector" WIDTH=50%></CENTER><BR><BR>

The first selector displays the Office in different formats.<BR><BR>
To <span class=prm>pray</span> the hour, please select either mode:<BR>
<UL>
<LI><span class=prm>all</span> prints everything, including the common prayers. (Default)
<LI><span class=prm>psalms</span> only indicates the common prayers.
</UL>
For instance, click now on the leftmost selector, choosing <span class=prma>Psalms</span> and click on the
<span class=prm>Completorium</span> button.<BR><BR>

This will result: <BR><BR>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="horastable.png" ALT="horastable" WIDTH=80%></CENTER><BR><BR>

<UL>
<LI>Click the button next to the indicated element in the Hour, and the text will come up in a separate window as a <span class=prma>popup</span>. The picture shows the <span class=prma>Pater Noster</span> as popup.<BR><BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="expandedpopup.png" ALT="expanded and popup"></CENTER><BR><BR>
<LI>In any selection, clicking on <B>Top</B> brings the cell to the top, <B>Next</B> brings the next cell to the top.<BR><BR>
<LI>The number in the right part of the cell is for reference.<BR><BR>
<LI>If you click on any <span class=prma>radio button</span> next to the section title,
that part will be expanded. Click an another to change the expanded part, or on the same
section's button again, to contract the expansion.<BR>
</UL>
The second selector chooses the rubrical structure, of which 7 options are provided. The programlet defaults to the 1960 rubrics.<BR><BR>
The third selector designates the language in which the Office is displayed in the right-hand column. If a translation is not fully available in a particular language, the second column in the displayed Office will default to English text. If you select the same language as the first column, only that language will 
be displayed in a single column.<BR><BR>
The fourth selector permits a choice from among several votive Offices, such as the <I>Officium Defunctorum</I> or the <I>Officium Parvum</I> of the Blessed Virgin Mary.<BR><BR>
Within the text:<BR>
<UL>
<LI><font color="red">&#x2720;&#xFE0E;</font> stands for the regular Sign of the Cross (forehead, breast, left, then right shoulder).<BR>
<LI><font color="red">+</font> stands for making a cross with your thumb on your lips.<BR>
<LI><font color="red">&#x2719;&#xFE0E;</font> stands for making a cross with your thumb on your breast.<BR>
</LI></UL>
You may also change the date by clicking on <span class=prm>Ordo</span> tab. The Ordo is divided in two columns: the Proprium de Tempore and the Proprium Sanctorum. On a given day, the side which is displayed in bold-face type represents the correct Office for that day in a specific rubrical structure (i.e. Rubrics 1960).<BR><BR> 
One can select another <B>date</B> by clicking the day of the month in the first column. Also, you may change the <B>year</B> or <B>month</B> at the top, or the rubrical structure (1570, 1910, etc.) at the bottom of the page.<BR><BR>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="ordo.png" ALT="ordo" WIDTH=80%></CENTER><BR><BR>

It is possible to compare rubrical structures by clicking on "Compare", near the date selector on the Officium screen. One can then select two different rubrical structures (e.g. Tridentine 1570 and Reduced 1955) to compare any hour of the Office under each rubrical structure.<BR><BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="compare.png" ALT="compare" WIDTH=75%></CENTER><BR><BR>
It is also possible to compare the Ordo for these two rubrical structures by clicking "Ordo". The top line will display the first rubrical structure and the bottom line will return the second selected rubrical structure. To return from displaying the compared Ordo to the compared Officium, click "Hodie" at the top of the screen. Finally, to return to displaying the Office in one version alone, click "One Version" at the bottom of the screen.<BR><BR>

If Divinum Officium has been downloaded to one's computer via <a href="https://github.com/divinumofficium">GitHub</a> as a local web host, it is possible to edit the individual files and track changes. Please see the <A HREF="download.html">Download</A> page for details.<BR><BR>

It is our hope that the entire Divinum Officium Project will help everyone to understand the Divine Office and Mass better, and help people to start to pray the <I>Breviarium Romanum</I> and the texts of the <I>Missale Romanum</I> on a daily basis.<BR>
