General Decree

The rubrics reduced to a simpler form

Whereas priests today especially those who have the care of souls,
are burdened with various new apostolic duties, so that they can
scarcely recite the divine Office with the tranquility of mind which
it requires, some Ordinaries have earnestly petitioned the Holy See
that some provision be graciously made to meet this difficulty, and
at least the copious apparatus of the Rubrics be reduced to a simpler form.

His Holiness Pius XII in his pastoral care and solicitude entrusted
the examination of this matter to a special Commission of learned men
who are charged with the restoration of the liturgy in general. 
This Commission, after a careful study of the entire subject, decided 
that the present Rubrics should be reduced to more convenient 
regulations in such a way, however, that they could be put into practice, 
keeping in the meantime, the liturgical books as they are, until further 
provision is made.

When all this was referred to His Holiness by His Eminence the Cardinal 
Prefect of the S.C. of Rites, His Holiness deigned to approve the 
following arrangement of the Rubrics and ordered that it be published, 
with the understanding that the provisions of this decree are to go 
into effect on the first of January, 1956.

In the meantime, the pontifical publishers of liturgical books are to 
see to it that no change whatever is made in arranging whatever new 
editions may be made of the Roman Breviary and Missal.

All things to the contrary notwithstanding.

The rubrics reduced to a simpler form

Title I: General Norms

1. The ordinances which follow concern the Roman rite. 
Whatever is not mentioned here is unchanged.

2. The term calendar applies both to the calendar in use in the 
universal church and to particular calendars.

3. The rules which follow are to be observed in both the private 
and public recitation of the Divine Office, unless there is 
express provision to the contrary.

4. All particular indults and customs, even those worthy of special 
mention, if contrary to these ordinances, are to be considered as 
expressly revoked.

Title II: Changes in the calendar

1. The grade and rite of semi-double is suppressed.

2. The liturgical days which are now marked in the calendar as 
semi-double rite are celebrated in the simple rite except the 
Vigil of Pentecost which is raised to the double rite.

a) Sundays

3. The Sundays of Advent and Lent and those that follow up to 
Low Sunday, and also Pentecost Sunday, are celebrated as doubles 
of the first class, and outrank all feasts both in occurrence 
and concurrence.

4. When feasts of the first class occur on the second, third 
or fourth Sunday of Advent, masses of the Feast are permitted 
except the conventual Mass.

5. Sundays which have hitherto been celebrated in the 
semi-double rite, are raised to the double rite but in the 
meantime the antiphons are not recited in the double form.

6. A Sunday Office and Mass which is impeded is neither 
anticipated or resumed.

7. If on Sundays per annum there occur a feast or title or 
any mystery of our Lord, the feast itself takes the place 
of the Sunday, and the latter is merely commemorated.

b) Vigils

8. The privileged vigils are: the Vigil of the Nativity 
of the Lord and the vigil of Pentecost.

9. The common vigils are: the Vigil of the Ascension of 
Our Lord, the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, 
Saint John the Baptist, Saints Peter and Paul, Saint Lawrence. 
All other vigils, including those marked in particular calendars, 
are suppressed.

10. Common Vigils, if they occur on a Sunday, are not 
anticipated but omitted.

11. Only the octaves of Easter, Christmas and Pentecost are 
celebrated; all others occurring either in the universal or 
in particular calendars are suppressed.

12. The days with the Easter and Pentecost octaves are raised 
to the double rite, are preferred to all feasts, do not admit 
of commemorations.

13. The days of the octave of Christmas, although they are of 
the double rite, are celebrated as at present.

14. On the days from the 2nd to the 5th of January, unless some 
feast occur, the Office is of the current feria in the simple rite. 
In the Office, the antiphons and psalms at all the Hours and the 
verse of the nocturn are of the current day of the week as in the 
psalter; the rest as on the first of January excepting the lessons, 
which are said from the current Scripture with their responses, 
and the Te Deum is said. The conclusion of the hymns and the verse 
in the short responsory at Prime are said as on Christmas. 
The Mass is the same as that of the 1st of January, without the Credo 
and without the special Communicantes.

Low votive Masses and low Masses cotidianae defunctorum are forbidden.

verse of the nocturn are from the current day of the week as in 
the psalter; the rest as on the Feast of the Epiphany except the 
lessons, which are said from the current Scripture with their responses, 
and the Te Deum is said. The conclusion of the hymns and the versicle 
at Prime are from the Epiphany. The Mass is the same as that of the

Low votive Masses and low Masses cotidianae defunctorum are forbidden

16. On the 13th of January, the commemoration of the baptism of 
Our Lord is celebrated, in the major double rite. The Office and 
Mass are said as at present on the Octave of the Epiphany.

But if the Commemoration of the Baptism of Our Lord occurs on Sunday, 
the Office and Mass are those of the Feast of the Holy Family without 
any commemoration. On the preceding Saturday is placed the beginning 
of the first Epistle to the Corinthians.

17. The days from the Ascension of Our Lord to the vigil of Pentecost 
exclusive are feriae tempore paschali (in the simple rite). In the 
Office, the antiphons and psalms at all the Hours and the verse of 
the nocturn are said from the current day of the week as in the psalter; 
the rest as on the Feast of the Ascension of Our Lord, except the lessons, 
which are said from the current Scripture with their responses. 
The conclusion of the hymns and the verse at Prime are said from the 
feast of the Ascension; the Mass from the same feast, without the 
Credo and without the special Communicantes.

Low votive Masses and low Masses cotidianae defunctorum are forbidden.

On the vigil of Pentecost nothing is to be changed.

unless the Mass is of the day of death or burial with the body present, 
or not even present for some reasonable cause, and excepting 
All Souls Day. On this day, however, the sequence need be said 
only once, that is, in the principal Mass otherwise in the first Mass.

7. The Credo is said only on Sundays and feasts of the first class, 
on feasts of our Lord and of the blessed Virgin Mary, and the 
natal feasts of the Apostles and Evangelists, on feasts of the

If this is lacking the Preface de tempore, is to be said; otherwise,
