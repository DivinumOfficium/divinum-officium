!Wis 5:1
v. Then shall the just stand with great constancy against those that have afflicted them, and taken away their labours.
$Deo gratias

[Hymnus Vespera]
v. While Christ's disciples, grieving, sad,
Their master's painful death deplore,
Whom faithless servants' cruel hands,
Had bathed in his own crimson gore;
_
Quick from the happy realms above,
An angel comes on joyful wing,
And to the women tells the joy
That to his flock their Lord will bring.
_
As they with eager steps make haste,
Their joyous message to repeat,
Their master's glorious form they see,
And falling clasp his sacred feet.
_
Cheered by this tale, his faithful flock
The Galilean mount ascend,
And there with loving awe behold
Their heart's sole wish, their truest friend.
_
That thou mayst be our Paschal joy
Through happy, never-ending years,
thine own poor children, Jesu, free
From sin's sad death with all its fears.
_
* To God the Father, and the Son,
Who rose from death, glad praise repeat;
Let equal praise be ever sung
To God the Holy Paraclete.
Amen.

In loud accord both far and nigh
