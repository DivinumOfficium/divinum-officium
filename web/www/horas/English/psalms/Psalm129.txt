129:1 (A gradual canticle.) Out of the depths I have cried to thee, O Lord:
129:2 Lord, hear my voice. Let thy ears be attentive to the voice of my supplication.
129:3 If thou, O Lord, wilt mark iniquities: Lord, who shall stand it?
129:4 For with thee there is merciful forgiveness: and by reason of thy law, I have waited for thee, O Lord. My soul hath relied on his word:
129:5 my soul hath hoped in the Lord.
129:6 From the morning watch even until night, let Israel hope in the Lord.
129:7 Because with the Lord there is mercy: and with him plentiful redemption.
129:8 And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
