61:1 (Unto the end, for Idithun, a psalm of David.)
61:2 Shall not my soul be subject to God? for from him is my salvation.
61:3 For he is my God and my saviour: he is my protector, I shall be moved no more.
61:4 How long do you rush in upon a man? you all kill, as if you were thrusting down a leaning wall, and a tottering fence.
61:5 But they have thought to cast away my price; I ran in thirst: they blessed with their mouth, but cursed with their heart.
61:6 But be thou, O my soul, subject to God: for from him is my patience.
61:7 For he is my God and my saviour: he is my helper, I shall not be moved.
61:8 In God is my salvation and my glory: he is the God of my help, and my hope is in God.
61:9 Trust in him, all ye congregation of people: pour out your hearts before him. God is our helper for ever.
61:10 But vain are the sons of men, the sons of men are liars in the balances: that by vanity they may together deceive.
61:11 Trust not in iniquity, and covet not robberies: if riches abound, set not your heart upon them.
61:12 God hath spoken once, these two things have I heard, that power belongeth to God,
61:13 And mercy to thee, O Lord; for thou wilt render to every man according to his works.
