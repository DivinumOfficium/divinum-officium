104:1 Give glory to the Lord, and call upon his name: declare his deeds among the Gentiles.
104:2 Sing to him, yea sing praises to him: relate all his wondrous works.
104:3 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord.
104:4 Seek ye the lord, and be strengthened: seek his face evermore.
104:5 Remember his marvellous works which he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth.
104:6 O ye seed of Abraham his servant; ye sons of Jacob his chosen.
104:7 He is the Lord our God: his judgments are in all the earth.
104:8 He hath remembered his covenant for ever: the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.
104:9 Which he made to Abraham; and his oath to Isaac:
104:10 And he appointed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting testament:
104:11 Saying: To thee will I give the land of Chanaan, the lot of your inheritance.
104:12 When they were but a small number: yea very few, and sojourners therein:
104:13 And they passed from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people.
104:14 He suffered no man to hurt them: and he reproved kings for their sakes.
104:15 Touch ye not my anointed: and do no evil to my prophets.
104:16 And he called a famine upon the land: and he broke in pieces all the support of bread.
104:17 He sent a man before them: Joseph, who was sold for a slave.
104:18 They humbled his feet in fetters: the iron pierced his soul,
104:19 Until his word came. The word of the Lord inflamed him.
104:20 The king sent, and he released him: the ruler of the people, and he set him at liberty.
104:21 He made him master of his house, and ruler of all his possession.
104:22 That he might instruct his princes as himself, and teach his ancients wisdom.
104:23 And Israel went into Egypt: and Jacob was a sojourner in the land of Cham.
104:24 And he increased his people exceedingly: and strengthened them over their enemies.
104:25 He turned their heart to hate his people: and to deal deceitfully with his servants.
104:26 He sent Moses his servant: Aaron the man whom he had chosen.
104:27 He gave them power to shew them signs, and his wonders in the land of Cham.
104:28 He sent darkness, and made it obscure: and grieved not his words.
104:29 He turned their waters into blood, and destroyed their fish.
104:30 Their land brought forth frogs, in the inner chambers of their kings.
104:31 He spoke, and there came diverse sorts of flies and sciniphs in all their coasts.
104:32 He gave them hail for rain, a burning fire in the land.
104:33 And he destroyed their vineyards and their fig trees: and he broke in pieces the trees of their coasts.
104:34 He spoke, and the locust came, and the bruchus, of which there was no number.
104:35 And they devoured all the grass in their land, and consumed all the fruit of their ground.
104:36 And he slew all the firstborn in their land: the firstfruits of all their labour.
104:37 And he brought them out with silver and gold: and there was not among their tribes one that was feeble.
104:38 Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them lay upon them.
104:39 He spread a cloud for their protection, and fire to give them light in the night.
104:40 They asked, and the quail came: and he filled them with the bread of heaven.
104:41 He opened the rock, and waters flowed: rivers ran down in the dry land.
104:42 Because he remembered his holy word, which he had spoken to his servant Abraham.
104:43 And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness.
104:44 And he gave them the lands of the Gentiles: and they possessed the labours of the people:
104:45 That they might observe his justifications, and seek after his law.
