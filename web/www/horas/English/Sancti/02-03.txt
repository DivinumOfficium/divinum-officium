!Commemoration for St. Blaise.
This Blaise was chosen Bishop of the city of Sebaste in Armenia, in which place he enjoyed a great reputation for virtue. When Diocletian began to make the Christians the objects of his insatiable cruelty, the Saint hid himself in a cave on Mount Argaeus, where he lay till he was found by some of the soldiers of Agricolaus the governor, who were out hunting. He was brought before the governor, who commanded him to be thrown into irons. While he was in prison, Blaise healed many of the sick, who were brought to him on account of his reputation of saintliness, and among others a boy who had been despaired of by the physicians, and who was at the point of death, from a fish bone which had become fixed in his throat. Blaise appeared twice before the governor, but neither cajolements nor threats could induce him to sacrifice to the gods. He was first beaten with rods, and afterwards put on the rack, where his flesh was mangled with iron combs. At last his head was cut off, whereby he finished a noble testimony to the faith which is in Christ our Lord. He bore witness on the 3rd day of February, (in the year of salvation 316).
