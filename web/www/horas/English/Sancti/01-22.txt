[Oratio]
Let thy merciful ears, O Lord, be open unto our prayers, and whereas we do feel~
ourselves burdened by the guilt of our sins, do Thou graciously relieve us at~
the petition of thy blessed Martyrs, Vincent and Anastasius.

[Lectio4]
Vincent was born at Huesca in Aragon in Spain. He was early turned to study,~
and learned sacred letters from Valerius, Bishop of Saragossa. He was accustomed~
to deliver discourses for this Prelate, who, owing to an impediment in his~
speech, was not able to preach himself. This coming to the ears of Dacian,~
Prefect of the province under Diocletian and Maximian, he caused Vincent to be~
arrested at Saragossa, and brought before him at Valencia in bonds. The saint~
was scourged, and afterwards tormented on the rack, in presence of numerous~
spectators, but neither torture, threats, nor fair words could bend his~
resolution. He was then laid on a grating over hot coals, his flesh mangled with~
iron hooks, and white-hot plates of metal applied to the wounds. The still~
breathing remains were taken back to a prison, and laid on broken potsherds,~
that the agony of his naked body might prevent his sleeping from exhaustion.

[Lectio5]
As he lay in his dark cell, a glorious light suddenly filled the prison, to the~
astonishment of all who saw it. The gaoler informed Dacian, who caused the~
martyr to be brought out and cared for in a soft bed, hoping that though he had~
failed to move him by cruelty, he might seduce him by pretended kindness. But~
the indomitable soul of Vincent, armed with faith and hope in Christ Jesus,~
remained unconquered even to the end, and triumphing over the fire, the steel,~
and the cruelty of the tormentors, passed away to receive the victorious crown~
of martyrdom in heaven, on the 22nd day of January, (in the year of our Lord~
304.) His body was thrown out unburied. A raven perched upon it and kept off~
with his beak, claws, and wings both the other birds and a wolf, which came to~
prey on it. Dacian then had it thrown into the sea, but by the will of God it~
was washed up again, and the Christians took and buried it.

[Lectio6]
Anastasius was a Persian monk who made a pilgrimage to the Holy Places at~
Jerusalem in the reign of the Emperor Heraclius, during which journey he endured~
bonds and stripes on account of his confession of Christ at Banias, then called~
Cassarea, in Palestine. Soon after his return, he was arrested by the Persians~
for the same cause, and, after enduring diverse torments, he and seventy other~
Christians were beheaded by order of King Chosroes. He testified upon the 22nd~
day of January in the year of our Lord 628. His reliques were first carried to~
Jerusalem, to the monastery in which he had made his monastic profession, and~
afterwards to Rome, where they were laid in the monastery of Saints Vincent and~
Anastasius.

[Lectio94]
Vincent, born at Huesca in Spain. was an earnest student even as a child. He~
learned the sacred sciences from Valerius, Bishop of Saragossa. and then took~
over the work of preaching the Gospel since the bishop could not fulfill his~
preaching office because of an impediment of speech. For this reason Vincent was~
reported to the wicked prefect, Dacian, and brought to him in Valencia. He~
suffered imprisonment, hunger, racking and many other tortures; and gained the~
crown of martyrdom on the 22nd of January. Anastasius, a Persian monk, made a~
pilgrimage to the holy places in Jerusalem at the time of the emperor Heraclius.~
At Caesarea in Palestine he steadfastly endured imprisonment and scourging for~
professing his faith in Christ. Soon after, in Persia, he was afflicted by King~
Chosroes with many tortures for the same cause and was beheaded, together with~
seventy other Christians. His relics were first brought to Jerusalem, then taken~
to Rome, and finally placed in the monastery at Aquae Salviae.
