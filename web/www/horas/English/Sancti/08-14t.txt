From the Sermons of St. Maximus, Bishop (of Turin.)
!1st on St. Lawrence.
It is an holy thing, brethren, and a thing well-pleasing in the sight of God, to~
venerate with special earnestness the Birth-day of blessed Lawrence, in the~
radiance of whose flames the victorious Church of Christ doth, even unto this~
day, shine splendidly throughout all the world. He discharged the office of a~
Deacon at the seat of the most glorious of the Patriarchates, and by the purity~
of his stainless life, and the brilliant victory of his noble death, hath gained~
himself a place in the fellowship of the Apostles. It is not an exaggeration to~
claim something in common with the Apostles for one whose purity of soul gave~
him the ministry of a Levite, and whose fulness of faith hath crowned him with~
the dignity of Martyrdom.

[Lectio5]
When the worshipful Sixtus, Bishop of the city of Rome, was overcoming through~
suffering the wickedness of a frantic world, and was now drawing very nigh to~
the kingdom of heaven, he saw Lawrence very sorrowful at the death of his~
ghostly father, and he is said to have addressed to him, in the spirit of~
prophecy, these words Be not sorrowful, my son yet three days, and thou~
shalt follow me. Hence it appeareth, dearly beloved brethren, that the blessed~
Lawrence was not sorrowful because of his Bishop's victory, but because he was~
not going to equal his Bishop in conquering the world. Be not sorrowful, my son,~
said Sixtus, yet three days, and thou shalt follow me, that is to say Be not~
sorrowful, as though thou wert left alone in the world thy faith and thy life~
will not suffer thee to go without such a death as thou wouldest.

[Lectio6]
When, therefore, Lawrence learned from the mouth of the Priest and Martyr that~
he also was to be taken away, he called together the multitudes of the needy,~
and dispersed among them with godly bounty the treasures of the Church. This was a~
deep and heavenly thought of this spiritual-minded man, that he might care for~
the poor, and also that, at the same time, by the multitude consuming what he~
had given them, the persecutor might not be able to find anything to plunder.~
Herein he followed that which is written He hath dispersed, he hath given to~
the poor his righteousness endureth for ever. (Ps. cxi. 8.)

[Lectio7]
The Lesson is taken From the Holy Gospel according to John 
!John 12:24-27
At that time Jesus said unto His disciples Amen, Amen, I say unto you, Except a~
corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone. And so on.
_
Homily by St. John Chrysostom, Patriarch (of Constantinople.)
!65th on John.
Paul also, when disputing about the resurrection, hath used the same figure.~
What excuse then have they who believe not in the resurrection, when we see it~
take place every day in the case of seeds and plants, and even in (the~
procreative functions of) our own kind For the seed from which generation~
taketh place must first itself corrupt. But at the same time, when God doth~
anything, there is no need to look for any reason. How made He us out of nothing~
This I speak to Christians, who say that they believe the Scriptures.

[Lectio8]
But I will also bring forward another argument from human reason. Some live bad~
lives, and others live good lives. But many of the evil-doers attain to an happy~
old age, and the well-doers do not. How then is each to be rewarded according to~
his works and when They will certainly be rewarded, say (my opponents,) but~
still their bodies will not rise again. Do they not hear how Paul saith This~
corruptible must put on incorruption ( Cor. xv. 53.) And this cannot be~
understood of the soul, which is incapable of corruption. And it is called the~
rising again from the dead. Now, it is the body which falleth.

[Lectio93]
!For the Eve of the Assumption.
From the Holy Gospel according to Luke 
Luke 11:17-28 
At that time As Jesus~
spake unto multitudes, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and~
said unto Him Blessed is the womb that bare thee. And so on. 
Homily by StAugustine, Bishop (of Hippo.) 
!10th Tract on John.
Blessed is the Virgin Mary,~
because she did the will of the Father. (Matth. xii. 50.) This it was that the~
Lord praised in her, namely, that she did the will of His Father, not that her~
flesh had given birth to His Flesh. Be kind enough to give me your attention, my~
dear brethren. When the Lord amazed the crowd by working signs and wonders, and~
showing thereby What was veiled in His Flesh, a woman, in the astonishment of~
her mind, cried out Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which~
Thou hast sucked. But He said Yea, rather, blessed are they that hear the Word~
of God, and keep it. That is to say Even My Mother, whom ye call blessed, hath~
her blessedness from this, that she keepeth the word of God not because it was~
in her that the Word of God was made Flesh, and dwelt among us, but because she~
heareth and keepeth that Word of God by Which she was made, (John i. 3,) and~
Which in her was made Flesh.
