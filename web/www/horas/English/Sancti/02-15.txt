[Lectio93]
Faustinus and Jovita were brothers, born of a noble family at Brescia. While~
Trajan's persecution was raging, they were taken about in chains from one city~
of Italy to another, and exhibited in torture in each. This cruelty utterly~
failed to silence their confession of Christ, Whom they preached by their~
sufferings in every place where they were shown. They were afterwards kept for a~
long time at Brescia, where they were exhibited with wild beasts, and tormented~
with fire. Being both still alive, they were brought to Milan, without their~
chains having ever been taken off. At Milan they were tortured again with every~
invention of cruelty that could be devised. Nevertheless the great power of~
their faith made them more than conquerors, shining even as gold tried in the~
furnace. From Milan they were brought to Rome, where they were confirmed by Pope~
Evaristus, and where they were put to the torture again with extreme barbarity.~
They were afterwards shown in public at Naples, where the tormentors displayed~
their skill in diverse ways upon them. Here they were thrown chained into the sea,~
but the angels delivered them. Their stations of suffering, by their God-like~
patience, and the wonderful Power displayed in them, had now turned many souls~
to Jesus. In the end they were carried back to Brescia, and, when Hadrian took~
the empire, they were put to death by the axe at that place. The crown of~
martyrdom which they won is glorious.
