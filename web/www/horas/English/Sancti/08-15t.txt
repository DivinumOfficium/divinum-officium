Lesson from the book of Canticles
!Song 1:1-4
1 Let him kiss me with the kiss of his mouth: for thy breasts are better than~
wine,
2 Smelling sweet of the best ointments. thy name is as oil poured out: therefore~
young maidens have loved thee.
3 Draw me: we will run after thee to the odour of thy ointments. The king hath~
brought me into his storerooms: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, remembering~
thy breasts more than wine: the righteous love thee.
4 I am black but beautiful, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Cedar,~
as the curtains of Solomon.

[Responsory1]
R. I saw her, when, fair like a dove, she winged her flight above the rivers of~
waters. The priceless savour of her perfumes hung heavy in her garments.
* And about her it was as the flower of roses in the spring of the year, and~
lilies of the valleys. 
V. Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like a pillar of smoke,~
perfumed with myrrh and frankincense? 
R. And about her it was as the flower of roses in the spring of the year, and~
lilies of the valleys.

!Song 1:5-9
5 Do not consider me that I am brown, because the sun hath altered my colour:~
the sons of my mother have fought against me, they have made me the keeper in~
the vineyards: my vineyard I have not kept.
6 show me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou liest in~
the midday, lest I begin to wander after the flocks of thy companions.
7 If thou know not thyself, O fairest among women, go forth, and follow after~
the steps of the flocks, and feed thy kids beside the tents of the shepherds.
8 To my company of horsemen, in Pharao's chariots, have I likened thee, O my~
love.
9 thy cheeks are beautiful as the turtledove's, thy neck as jewels.

12 A bundle of myrrh is my beloved to me, he shall abide between my breasts.
13 A cluster of cypress my love is to me, in the vineyards of Engaddi.
14 Behold thou art fair, O my love, behold thou art fair, thy eyes are as those~
of doves.
15 Behold thou art fair, my beloved, and comely. Our bed is flourishing.
16 The beams of our houses are of cedar, our rafters of cypress trees.

From the Sermons of St. John of Damascus.
!2nd on the Falling-asleep of Blessed Mary.
This day the holy and animated Ark of the living God, which had held within it~
its own Maker, is borne to rest in that Temple of the Lord, which is not made~
with hands. David, whence it sprang, leapeth before it, and in company with~
him the Angels dance, the Archangels sing aloud, the Virtues ascribe glory, the~
Princedoms shout for joy, the Powers make merry, the Lordships rejoice, the~
Thrones keep holiday, the Cherubim utter praise, and the Seraphim proclaim its~
glory. This day the Eden of the new Adam receiveth the living garden of delight,~
wherein the condemnation was annulled, wherein the Tree of Life was planted,~
wherein our nakedness was covered.

[Lectio5]
This day the stainless maiden, who had been defiled by no earthly lust, but~
ennobled by heavenly desires, returned not to dust, but, being herself a living~
heaven, took her place among the heavenly mansions. From her true life had~
flowed for all men, and how should she taste of death? But she yielded obedience~
to the law established by Him to Whom she had given birth, and, as the daughter~
of the old Adam, underwent the old sentence, which even her Son, Who is the very~
Life Itself, had not refused; but, as the Mother of the living God, she was~
worthily taken by Him unto Himself.

[Lectio6]
Eve, who had said yea to the proposals of the serpent, was condemned to the~
pains of travail and the punishment of death, and found her place in the bowels~
of the Netherworld. But this truly blessed being who had inclined her ears to~
the word of God, whose womb had been filled by the action of the Holy Ghost, who,~
as soon as she heard the spiritual salutation of the archangel, had conceived~
the Son of God without any sexual pleasure or carnal knowledge by a man, who had~
brought forth her Offspring without any the least pang, who had hallowed herself~
altogether for the service of God how was death ever to feed upon her? how was~
the grave ever to eat her up? how was corruption to break into that body into~
which Life had been welcomed? For her there was a straight, smooth, and easy way~
to heaven. For if Christ, Who is the Life and the Truth, hath said Where I am,~
there shall also My servant be how much more shall not rather His mother be with~
Him?

From the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 10:38-42
At that time, Jesus entered into a certain village, and a woman named Martha~
received Him into her house. And so on.
_
Homily by St. Augustine, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!27th on the Words of the Lord.
When the Holy Gospel was read, we heard how that a godly woman hospitably~
received the Lord into her house, and that this woman's name was Martha. And~
while Martha herself was cumbered about much serving, a sister of her's, called~
Mary, sat at the Lord's Feet, and heard His word. The one worked, the other was~
idle. One ministered, the other was filled. Nevertheless, Martha, working hard~
in the bustle and business of the serving, came to the Lord, and made complaint~
of her sister, because she would not help her in her work.

[Responsory7]
R. Grace is poured into thy lips
* Therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.
V. thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces~
whereby kings' daughters among thy honourable women have made thee glad.
R. Therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.

[Lectio8]
But the Lord undertook to answer Martha for Mary; He, Who had been called upon~
to be her Judge, became her Advocate. And Jesus answered and said unto her~
Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things. But one thing~
is needful, and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away~
from her. We have heard both the complaint, and the sentence of the Judge, the~
which sentence replieth to the complainant, and shieldeth her whom the Lord had~
received. Mary was wrapped up in the sweetness of the word of the Lord. Martha~
was busied how to feed the Lord, and Mary, how to be fed by the Lord. Martha was~
getting ready a banquet for that same Lord, at Whose banquet Mary was already~
revelling.

[Responsory8]
R. O Virgin Mary, Mother of God, blessed art thou that didst believe the Lord,~
for there hath been a performance of those things which were told thee from the~
Lord. Behold, thou art exalted over choirs of Angels.
* Plead for us with the Lord our God.
V. Hail, Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.
R. Plead for us with the Lord our God.
&Gloria
R. Plead for us with the Lord our God.

[Lectio9]
When, then, Mary was listening in peace and gentleness to those words of~
unutterable sweetness, and being feasted to the full extent of her heart's power,~
and Martha came and complained of her to the Lord, how must we imagine that she~
feared, lest the Lord should say unto her Arise, and help thy sister? She was~
held by that wondrous sweetness the smack whereof is felt more by the mind than~
by the belly. She was excused, and she sat all the safer. But on what grounds~
was she excused? Let us now turn our attention to this point, and thoroughly see~
into and examine it as far as we can, that we also may be fed.
