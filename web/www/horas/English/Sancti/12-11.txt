Eternal Shepherd, do thou look with favor upon thy flock. Guard and keep it for~
evermore through blessed Damasus, thy Supreme Pontiff, whom thou didst choose to~
be the chief shepherd of the whole Church.

[Lectio4]
Damasus was a Spaniard, a man of eminence and of great learning in the~
Scriptures, (and was elected to the Chair of Peter in the year~
of our Lord 381) he convoked the First Council of Constantinople,~
wherein he crushed the wicked heresy of Eunomius and Macedonius. He confirmed~
the condemnation of the Assembly, at Rimini, which condemnation had already been~
pronounced by Liberius. This Assembly of Rimini was that in which, to use the~
language of St. Jerome, Valens and Ursacius brought it about through trickery~
that the Faith of Nice was abrogated by mob law, and the world afterwards~
groaned in amazement to find itself Arian.

[Lectio5]
This Pope built two Basilicas, first, St. Lawrence's, near Pompey's Theatre,~
which he magnificently enriched, and endowed with houses and farms; and,~
secondly, another, over the Catacombs on the Road to Ardea. He also consecrated~
the Platonia, where the bodies of St. Peter and St. Paul lay for some time, and~
decorated it with elegant inscriptions in poetry composed by himself. He wrote~
on the subject of virginity both in prose and verse, and likewise many other~
poems on various subjects.

[Lectio6]
He ordained that false accusers should be punished for the offences which they~
had falsely laid to the charge of their neighbours. He established the usage,~
which already prevailed in many churches, of singing the Psalms, both by day and~
by night, by alternate choirs, and of adding at the end of each Psalm the words,~
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. It was at his~
command that St. Jerome revised the translation of the New Testament to accord~
with the Greek text. He ruled the Church for seventeen years, two months, and~
twenty-six days. He held five Advent ordinations, wherein he ordained thirty-one~
Priests, eleven Deacons, and sixty-two Bishops for diverse Sees. At length he~
fell asleep in the Lord, in the reign of Theodosius the Elder, (upon the 10th~
day of December, in the year 384, being) aged nearly eighty years, and full of~
righteousness, truth, and judgment. He was buried beside his mother and sister~
in the Church which he had himself founded on the Road to Ardea. His reliques~
were afterwards taken to the Basilica of St. Lawrence, which is thence sometimes~
called San Lorenzo in Damaso.

[Lectio94]
Damasus was a Spaniard of great eminence and learned in the Sacred Scriptures. He called the first Council of Constantinople, in which he abolished the evil heresy of Eunomius and Macedonius. He repeated the condemnation, already pronounced by Liberius, of the Council of Rimini. A proclamation of that council, chiefly due, as writeth St. Jerome, to the intrigues of Valens and Ursacius, had condemned the faith of Nicea. Damasus built two basilicas: one dedicated to St. Lawrence near the theatre of Pompey, the other on the Ardeatine Way at the Catacombs. He decreed that, as was already the custom in many places, Psalms should be sung day and night in all churches by alternate choirs, and that at the end of each Psalm should be repeated the words: "Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost." It was at his command that St. Jerome revised the translation of the New Testament to make it faithful to the Greek text. He discovered many bodies of holy Martyrs and celebrated their memory in verses. When he was nearly eighty years old and famous for his virtue, learning and prudence, he fell asleep in the Lord, during the reign of Theodosius the Great.
