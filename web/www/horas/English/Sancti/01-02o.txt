Lesson from the Acts of Apostles
!Acts 7:51-54
51 You stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the~
Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do you also.
52 Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? And they have slain~
them who foretold of the coming of the Just One; of whom you have been now the~
betrayers and murderers:
53 Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.
54 Now hearing these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed with~
their teeth at him.

[Lectio2]
!Acts 7:55-58
55 But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looking up steadfastly to heaven, saw~
the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God. And he said:~
Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand~
of God.
56 And they crying out with a loud voice, stopped their ears, and with one~
accord ran violently upon him.
57 And casting him forth without the city, they stoned him; and the witnesses~
laid down their garments at the feet of a young man, whose name was Saul.
58 And they stoned Stephen, invoking, and saying: Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.

[Lectio3]
!Acts 7:59; 8:1-2
59 And falling on his knees, he cried with a loud voice, saying: Lord, lay not~
this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep in the Lord.~
And Saul was consenting to his death.
1 And at that time there was raised a great persecution against the church which~
was at Jerusalem; and they were all dispersed through the countries of Judea,~
and Samaria, except the apostles.
2 And devout men took order for Stephen's funeral, and made great mourning over~
him.
