Lesson from the book of Revelation
!Rev 4:1-4
1 After these things I looked, and behold a door was opened in heaven, and the~
first voice which I heard, as it were, of a trumpet speaking with me, said: Come~
up hither, and I will shew thee the things which must be done hereafter.
2 And immediately I was in the spirit: and behold there was a throne set in~
heaven, and upon the throne one sitting.
3 And he that sat, was to the sight like the jasper and the sardine stone; and~
there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.
4 And round about the throne were four and twenty seats; and upon the seats,~
four and twenty ancients sitting, clothed in white garments, and on their heads~
were crowns of gold.

[Lectio2]
!Rev 4:5-8
5 And from the throne proceeded lightnings, and voices, and thunders; and there~
were seven lamps burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God.
6 And in the sight of the throne was, as it were, a sea of glass like to crystal;~
and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four living~
creatures, full of eyes before and behind.
7 And the first living creature was like a lion: and the second living creature~
like a calf: and the third living creature, having the face, as it were, of a~
man: and the fourth living creature was like an eagle flying.
8 And the four living creatures had each of them six wings; and round about and~
within they are full of eyes. And they rested not day and night, saying: Holy,~
holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come.

[Lectio3]
!Rev 4:8-11
8 And the four living creatures had each of them six wings; and round about and~
within they are full of eyes. And they rested not day and night, saying: Holy,~
holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come.
9 And when those living creatures gave glory, and honour, and benediction to him~
that sitteth on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever;
10 The four and twenty ancients fell down before him that sitteth on the throne,~
and adored him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the~
throne, saying:
11 Thou art worthy, O Lord our God, to receive glory, and honour, and power:~
because thou hast created all things; and for thy will they were, and have been~
created.
