[Lectio93]
This Silverius was a native of Campania, and succeeded Agapitus in the Papacy~
~(in the year 536.) His orthodoxy and holiness shone brightest in his onslaughts~
upon heretics, and he showed admirable firmness in upholding a sentence by~
Agapitus. Agapitus had deposed Anthimus from the Patriarchate of Constantinople~
for defending Save the heresy of Eutyches; and Silverius would never allow of~
his restoration, although the Empress Theodora repeatedly asked him to do so.~
The woman was enraged at him on this account, and ordered Bellisarius to send~
Silverius into exile. He was accordingly banished to the island of Ponza, whence~
he is said to have written these words to Bishop Amator I am fed upon the~
bread of tribulation and the water of affliction, but nevertheless I have not~
given up, and I will not give up, doing my duty. But sickness and the hardships~
of his exile soon broke his strength, and he fell asleep in the Lord upon the~
20th day of June (in the year of grace 538.) Many miracles shed a lustre upon~
his grave. He ruled the Church for more than three years, and ordained in the~
month of December thirteen Priests, five Deacons, and nineteen Bishops for~
divers Sees.
