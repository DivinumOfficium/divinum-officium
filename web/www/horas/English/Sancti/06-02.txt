O God, Who dost every year gladden us by the solemn memorial of your blessed~
Martyrs Marcellinus, Peter, and Erasmus, grant us grace, we beseech thee,~
not only to rejoice because of their worthy deeds, but also to tread in their~
footsteps.

[Lectio93]
This Peter was an exorcist, whom, in the reign of the Emperor Diocletian,~
Serenus the Judge cast into prison at Rome because he confessed the Christian~
faith. He there set free Paulina, the daughter of Artemius, the keeper of the~
prison, from an evil spirit which tormented her. Upon this, Artemius and his~
wife and all their house, with their neighbours who had run together to see the~
strange thing, would fain be made friends with Jesus Christ. Peter therefore~
brought them to Marcellinus, the Priest, who baptized them all. When Serenus~
heard of it, he called Peter and Marcellinus before him, and sharply rebuked~
them, adding to his bitter words threats and terrors, unless they would deny~
Christ. Marcellinus answered him with Christian boldness, whereupon he caused~
him to be buffeted, separated him from Peter and shut him up naked in a prison~
strewn with broken glass, without either food or light. Peter also he straitly~
confined. But when both of them were found to wax faithfuller and braver in~
their bonds, they were beheaded, unshaken in their testimony, and confessing~
Jesus Christ gloriously by their blood. Elmo was a Bishop in Campania who, (in~
the year 303,) in the reign of the Emperors Diocletian and Maximian was beaten~
with clubs and whips loaded with lead, and afterwards anointed with melted pitch,~
sulphur, and lead, and boiling resin, wax, and oil. From all this he came forth~
whole and sound which wonder turned many to believe in Christ. He was remanded~
again to prison, and straitly bound in heavy iron fetters. But from these he was~
wondrously delivered by an angel. At last, at Formi, Maximian caused him to be~
subjected to diverse torments, and in the end being clad in a coat of redhot~
brass the power of God made him to be more than conqueror in this thing also,~
and to grasp the palm-branch of a glorious testimony, whereby he strengthened~
many in the faith and turned many to it.
