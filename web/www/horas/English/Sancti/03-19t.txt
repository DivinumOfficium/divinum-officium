[Lectio4]
From the Sermons of St. Bernard, Abbat of Clairvaux.
!2nd on Luke i. 26
What and what manner of man the blessed Joseph was, we may gather from that~
title wherewith, albeit only as a deputy, God deemed him fit to be honoured he~
was both called, and supposed to be the Father of God. We may gather it from his~
very name, which, being interpreted, signifieth Increase. Remember likewise that~
great Patriarch who was sold into Egypt, and know that the Husband of Mary not~
only received his name, but inherited his purity, and was likened to him in~
innocence and in grace.

[Lectio5]
If then, that Joseph that was sold by his brethren through envy, and was~
brought down to Egypt, was a type of Christ sold by a disciple, and handed over~
to the Gentiles, the other Joseph flying from the envy of Herod carried Christ~
into Egypt. That first Joseph kept loyal to his master, and would not carnally~
know his master's wife; that second Joseph knew that the Lady, the Mother of his~
Lord, was a virgin, and he himself remained faithfully virgin toward her. To~
that first Joseph it was given to know dark things in interpreting of dreams; to~
the second Joseph it was given in sleep to know the mysteries of the kingdom of~
heaven.

[Lectio6]
The first Joseph laid by bread, not for himself, but for all people; the second~
Joseph received into his keeping that Living Bread Which came down from heaven,~
not for him only, but for the whole world. We cannot doubt but that that Joseph~
was good and faithful to whom was espoused the Mother of the Saviour. Yea, I say,~
he was a faithful and wise servant, whom the Lord appointed to be the comfort of~
His own Mother, the keeper of His own Body, and the only and trusty helper in~
the Eternal Counsels.
