God, who year by year dost gladden us by the solemn feast day of thy Blessed~
Polycarp Martyr and Pontifex, mercifully grant that we who keep his birthday, may~
ever feel the joyful effects of his protection.

[Lectio4]
From the Book on Ecclesiastical Writers, composed by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Chapter 17
Polycarp was a disciple of the Apostle John, and was consecrated by him Bishop~
of Smyrna. He was reckoned the chief of all the Christians of Asia, because he~
had been taught by several of the Apostles, and other persons who had seen the~
Lord. During the reign of the Emperor Antoninus Pius, and while Anicetus~
presided over the Church of Rome, Polycarp came thither to discuss some~
questions regarding the time for observing Easter. He found some heretics at~
Rome, who had been led astray by the doctrine of Marcion and Valentine, and~
brought back many of them to the faith. One day Marcion met him by accident, and~
said to him Do you recognise me? whereto he replied I recognise the devil's~
eldest son. Some time after, in the reign of Mark Antonine and Lucius Aurelius~
Commodus, during the fourth persecution since Nero, when the Pro-consul was~
ruling in Smyrna, the whole population being assembled in the theatre, clamoured~
against Polycarp, and to please them he was burnt. He wrote an extremely useful~
Epistle to the Philippians, which is publicly read in the Churches of Asia even~
to this day.
