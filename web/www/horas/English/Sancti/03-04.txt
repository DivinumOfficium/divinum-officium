[Lectio4]
This Casimir was the son of Casimir III, King of Poland, by Elizabeth of~
Austria, his wife, (and was born upon the 3rd day of October, in the year~
1458.) From his childhood he was taught by the best masters, and was trained in~
all godliness and good learning. While he was still a boy he wore rough~
haircloth, and chastened himself with much fasting. He forsook the softness of~
his princely bed, and lay upon the hard ground, and on stormy nights he would go~
out secretly and prostrate himself before the doors of the churches, crying to~
God for mercy. He was unwearied in contemplating the Passion of Christ, and when~
he was present at Mass, so profound was his recollection, that he seemed to be~
altogether beside himself.

[Lectio5]
He made the propagation of the Catholic faith one of the chief works of his life,~
and strove hard against the schism in Ruthenia. He persuaded his father to~
forbid by law that the schismatics should build any new churches, or repair the~
existing ones when they fell into decay. So great was his liberality and~
tenderness toward the needy and the afflicted, that he came to be called the~
father and guardian of the poor. From his infancy he never soiled his purity,~
and in his last illness, when his physicians advised him to seek for relief from~
his grievous sufferings by the sacrifice of his chastity, he cheerfully~
determined rather to die.

[Lectio6]
Being made perfect in a short space, and full of piety and good works, he~
foretold the day of his own death, and, gathering round him a choir of priests~
and monks, he rendered his soul into the hands of God Whom they were praising,~
~(upon the 4th day of March, in the year of our Lord 1482, and) the 25th of his~
own age. His body was carried to Wilna, where many miracles are reputed to have~
been wrought around it. At his grave a dead girl is said to have received her~
life again, blind men their sight, cripples the power of walking, and many sick~
folk health. Moreover, on an occasion when the Lithuanians in scanty numbers~
were exposed to the shock of a powerful enemy, they believed that he appeared in~
the air, and gave them the signal victory which they won. On the assurance of~
these things, Leo X. was moved to add his name to those of the Saints.

[Lectio94]
Casimir, son of the king of Poland, was brought up from his childhood in the~
love of God and in learning. He tamed his youthful body by wearing a hair-shirt,~
and weakened it with continual fasting. Indefatigable in contemplating the~
Passion of Christ, he never slackened in the spirit of prayer. He was most~
zealous in promoting the Catholic faith and in doing away with the schism of the~
Ruthenians. So helpful and kind was he to the poor and to all those afflicted by~
any calamity that he earned the name of father and defender of the needy. He~
preserved his virginity intact all his life. Made perfect in a short time,~
filled with grace and merits, he gave up his spirit to God on the day which he~
had foretold, in the twenty-fifth year of his age. He was famous for many~
miracles, and Leo X numbered him among the Saints.
