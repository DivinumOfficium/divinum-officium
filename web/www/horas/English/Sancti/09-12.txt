[Ant 1]
O Holy Mary, * be thou an help to the helpless, a strength to the fearful, a~
comfort to the sorrowful; pray for the people, plead for the clergy, make~
intercession for all women vowed to God; may all that are keeping this Commemoration of thine~
holy Name feel the might of thine assistance.

[Oratio]
Grant we beseech thee, O Almighty God, that thy faithful people, who rejoice in~
the Name and keeping of the most holy Virgin Mary, may by her Motherly prayers~
be freed from all ills upon earth, and worthily attain unto thine everlasting~
joy in heaven.

From the Sermons of St. Bernard, Abbot (of Clairvaux.)
!Second Homily on Luke i. 26
It is said: And the virgin's name was Mary. Let us speak a few words upon this~
name, which signifieth, being interpreted, Star of the Sea, and suiteth very~
well the Maiden Mother, who may very meetly be likened unto a star. A star~
giveth forth her rays without any harm to herself, and the Virgin brought forth~
her Son without any hurt to her virginity. The light of a star taketh nothing~
away from the star itself, and the birth of her offspring took nothing away from~
the Virginity of Mary. She is that noble star which was to come out of Jacob,~
~(Num. xxiv. 17,) whose brightness still sheddeth lustre upon all the earth,~
whose rays are most brilliant in heaven, and shine even unto hell, lighting up~
earth midway, and warming souls rather than bodies, fostering good and scaring~
away evil. She, I say, is a clear and shining star, twinkling with excellencies,~
and resplendent with example, needfully set to look down upon the surface of~
this great and wide sea.

[Lectio5]
Thou, whosoever thou art, that knowest thyself to be here not so much walking~
upon firm ground, as battered to and fro by the gales and storms of this life's~
ocean, if thou wouldest not be overwhelmed by the tempest, keep thine eyes fixed~
upon this star's clear shining. If the hurricanes of temptation rise against~
thee, or thou art running upon the rocks of trouble, look to the star, call on~
Mary. If the waves of pride, or ambition, or slander, or envy toss thee, look to~
the star, call on Mary. If the billows of anger or avarice, or the enticements~
of the flesh beat against thy soul's bark, look to Mary. If the enormity of thy~
sins trouble thee, if the foulness of thy conscience confound thee, if the dread~
of judgment appall thee, if thou begin to slip into the deep of despondency, into~
the pit of despair, think of Mary.

[Lectio6]
In danger, in difficulty, or in doubt, think on Mary, call on Mary. Let her not~
be away from thy mouth or from thine heart, and that thou mayest not lack the~
succour of her prayers, turn not aside from the example of her conversation. If~
thou follow her, thou wilt never go astray. If thou pray to her, thou wilt never~
have need to despair. If thou keep her in mind, thou wilt never wander. If she~
hold thee, thou wilt never fall. If she lead thee, thou wilt never be weary. If~
she help thee, thou wilt reach home safe at the last and so thou wilt prove in~
thyself how meetly it is said And the virgin's name was Mary. {Here ends St~
Bernard.) Particular honours were already paid to this worshipful name in diverse~
parts of the Christian world, but the Bishop of Rome, Innocent XI., ordered this~
Feast in honour of it to be held every year throughout the whole Church, upon~
the Lord's Day within the Octave of the Birthday of the Blessed Virgin Mary, as~
an everlasting thanksgiving for the great blessing that, under her protection,~
the brutal Sultan of the Turks, who was trampling upon the necks of the~
Christian population, was thoroughly beaten before the walls of Vienna, (upon~
the 12th day of September, in the year 1683.)

From the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 1:26-38
At that time: The Angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named~
Nazareth, to a Virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of~
David; and the Virgin's name was Mary. And so on.
_
Homily by St. Peter Chrysologus, Archbishop (of Ravenna.)
!142nd on the Annunciation
Dearly beloved brethren, ye have this day heard how an Angel treated with a~
woman touching the regeneration of mankind. Ye have heard how it was arranged~
that man should return to life by the same mean whereby he had fallen into~
death. The Angel treateth, treateth with Mary concerning salvation, because an~
angel had treated with Eve concerning destruction. Ye have heard how an Angel~
set about to raise with unspeakable building a temple of the Divine Majesty out~
of the dust of the earth. Ye have heard how by a mystery which cannot be~
understood, God got a place on earth and man a place in heaven. Ye have heard~
how by a working hitherto unheard of, God and man are joined together in one~
Body. Ye have heard how at the message of an angel, the weak nature whereof our~
flesh is sharer, became strong to bear the whole glory of the Godhead.

[Responsory7]
R. O Holy Virgin Mary, happy indeed art thou, and right worthy of all praise
* For out of thee rose the Sun of righteousness, even Christ our God.
V. Pray for the people, plead for the clergy, make intercession for all women~
vowed to God. May all that are keeping this Commemoration of thy Name feel the might~
of thine assistance.
R. For out of thee rose the Sun of righteousness, even Christ our God.

[Lectio8]
Then, lest the frail clay of humanity should break down under the weight of~
God's work, and in Mary the tender stem should snap, which was about to bear the~
fruit of all mankind, the Angel's first words were a preventive against fear.~
And the Angel said unto her Fear not, Mary. Even before the matter is revealed,~
the exalted station of this Virgin is made clear by her very name, for the name~
Mary is an Hebrew word, and signifieth Lady. The Angel therefore greeteth her as~
Lady, that the Mother of the Lord may lay aside the fearfulness of His~
handmaiden, whom the will of her own Offspring had made to be born and to be~
called a Lady. Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found grace. He that hath found~
grace, need fear no more. Thou hast found grace.

[Lectio9](rubrica divino aut rubrica 1955)
Blessed is she who alone among mankind, and first among mankind deserved to hear: Thou hast found grace. And how much grace? Even as the Angel had said: Full! Full of grace.  Full indeed!  Grace like a bountiful shower drenched and soaked her whole being. For thou hast found grace with God.  As he saith this, even the Angel doth marvel. He marvelleth that a woman should merit eternal life, that all men should merit it through her. The Angel marvelleth that the whole Godhead, he to whom the entire universe is small, should enter the narrow womb of a virgin. So he delayeth. He calleth her virgin. That was her right. He haileth her as full of grace. Then, with great trepidation he delivereth his message, scarcely able to phrase it so that it could be understood.

From the epistle of St. Leo the Great, Pope, to Pulcheria Augusta.
!Epistle 1, before the middle
And the fulfilment of the mystery of our atonement, which was ordained from all~
eternity, was not assisted by any figures because the Holy Spirit had not yet~
come upon the Virgin, and the power of the Most High had not over-shadowed her:~
so that Wisdom building herself a house within her undefiled body, the Word~
became flesh; and the form of God and the form of a slave coming together into~
one person, the Creator of times was born in time; and He Himself through whom~
all things were made, was brought forth in the midst of all things. For if the~
New Man had not been made in the likeness of sinful flesh, and taken on Him our~
old nature, and being consubstantial with the Father, had deigned to be~
consubstantial with His mother also, and being alone free from sin, had united~
our nature to Him the whole human race would be held in bondage beneath the~
Devil's yoke.

[Lectio94]
The honoured name of the Virgin Mary, which is said to mean Star of the Sea, is most fitting for the Virgin Mother. She may well be compared to a star; for, as a star beameth forth its rays without any diminution of its own lustre, so too the Virgin gave birth to a Son with no loss to her virginity. The departing rays do not lessen the star's brightness, nor Mary's Son her ínviolate maidenhood. She is, therefore, that noble star risen from Jacob and raised by nature above this great and wide sea. She shineth with merits, she enlighteneth with her example. Ye, all ye that are cast about upon sea of temporalities in storms and tempests more than ye walk on solid land, turn ye not your eyes away from the brightness of this star. Think of Mary, call on Mary, so that ye may experience for yourself how fittingly it was said, And the Virgin's name was Mary. - Pope Innocent XI ordered the Feast of this most holy name, which had already been honoured with a special rite in some parts of the Christian world, to be celebrated each year by the universal Church as a perpetual memorial of the great blessing of that signal victory won at Vienna in Austria over the cruel Turkish tyrant who had been grinding down the Christian people.
