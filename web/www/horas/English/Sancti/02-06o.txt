St. Dorothy, Virgin and Martyr

[Name]
Dorothy

[Lectio93]
The maiden Dorothy, of Caesarea in Cappadocia, was betrayed to Apricius the President by her two sisters, Chrysta and Callista, who had denied the faith, in the hope that he would induce her to do likewise. She was arrested, but it came not to pass as they hoped. On the contrary, she brought them back to the Christian worship, and they received martyrdom. She was long tormented upon the rack, and scourged with palm branches, and in the end was beheaded, receiving the double palm of virginity and martyrdom.
