!Song 5:8-12
8 I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my beloved, that you tell~
him that I languish with love.
9 What manner of one is thy beloved of the beloved, O thou most beautiful among~
women? what manner of one is thy beloved of the beloved, that thou hast so~
adjured us?
10 My beloved is white and ruddy, chosen out of thousands.
11 His head is as the finest gold: his locks as branches of palm trees, black as a~
raven.
12 His eyes as doves upon brooks of waters, which are washed with milk, and sit~
beside the plentiful streams.

[Lectio2]
!Song 6:1-5
1 My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the bed of aromatical spices, to~
feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
2 I to my beloved, and my beloved to me, who feedeth among the lilies.
3 Thou art beautiful, O my love, sweet and comely as Jerusalem: terrible as an~
army set in array.
4 Turn away thy eyes from me, for they have made me flee away. thy hair is as a~
flock of goats, that appear from Galaad.
5 thy teeth as a flock of sheep, which come up from the washing, all with twins,~
and there is none barren among them.

[Lectio3]
!Song 6:8-12
8 One is my dove, my perfect one is but one, she is the only one of her mother,~
the chosen of her that bore her. The daughters saw her, and declared her most~
blessed: the queens and concubines, and they praised her.
9 Who is she that cometh forth as the morning rising, fair as the moon, bright~
as the sun, terrible as an army set in array?
10 I went down into the garden of nuts, to see the fruits of the valleys, and to~
look if the vineyard had flourished, and the pomegranates budded.
11 I knew not: my soul troubled me for the chariots of Aminadab.
12 Return, return, O Sulamitess: return, return that we may behold thee.

[Lectio4]
From the Sermons of St. Bernard, Abbot (of Clairvaux.)
!1st on the Assumption.
When the glorious Virgin this day mounted upon the heavens, without doubt, she~
abundantly increased the joy of the citizens above. This same is she the voice~
of whose salutation maketh to leap with joy even such as are still shut up in~
their mothers' bellies. (Luke i. 41, 44.) If the soul of an unborn babe melted~
when Mary spake, what must we imagine to have been the jubilation of the~
heavenly ones, when it was their reward at once to hear her voice, and to see~
her face, and to enjoy her blessed presence.

[Lectio5]
But who also can picture to himself with what glory the Queen of the world went~
forth, and with what keen desire the whole multitude of the armies which are in~
heaven came out to meet her, with what hymns she was led to her throne of glory,~
with what a look of peace, with what a countenance of grace, with what Divine~
embraces her Son welcomed her, and set her above everything which God hath made?~
It was that be taken away from her. honour of which such a Mother was worthy,~
and with that glory which beseemed such a Son.

[Lectio6]
Sweet indeed were the kisses which the Suckling, Whom His Mother had praised~
while yet He lay hid in her virginal womb, pressed upon her lips. But shall we~
not believe that sweeter were those which she received from Him in blessed~
welcome, when He was sitting at the right hand of His Father, and she went up to~
the throne of His glory, singing the marriage-song and saying Let Him kiss me~
with the kisses of His mouth? (Cant. i. 2.) Who shall declare the generation of~
Christ or the Assumption of Mary So much as she found grace on earth more than~
others, so much more excellent than that of others is the glory which she hath~
in heaven.

[Lectio7]
From the Holy Gospel according to Luke 
!Luke 10:38-42
At that time Jesus~
entered into a certain village, and a woman named Martha received Him into her~
house. And so on.
_
Homily by St. Augustine, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!27th on the Words of the Lord.
The troubling about many things passeth away, but the love for the one thing~
remaineth. Therefore that which Mary hath chosen shall not But that which thou~
hast chosen, O Martha, it must needs follow, it must needs be understood, shall~
be taken away from thee. But it will be taken away from thee for thy good, that~
that which is better may be given unto thee. Work will be taken away from thee~
that thou mayest rest. Thou art on the voyage Mary is already in port.

[Lectio8]
Ye see then, my dearly beloved brethren, and, as I think, ye now understand that~
in these two women, who were both well-pleasing in the sight of the Lord, both~
lovely, both disciples, ye see, I say, and whosoever ye be that understand, ye~
understand something great, which ye also that do not understand ought to hear~
and know, that in these two women there were figured two lives, that which now~
is, and that which is to come, the toilful and the restful, the sorrowing and~
the blessed, the temporal and the eternal.

[Lectio9]
There are two lives. Think more about them. Whatsoever this present life hath, I~
say not of evil, not of wickedness, not of crime, not of uncleanness, not of~
ungodliness, but toilsome and full of troubles, chastened by fears, and tried by~
temptations, so, I say, is even the guileless life which Martha must have. Look~
into this, then, as well as ye can, and, as I have said, think more about it~
than I speak. There was no wrong life in that house, either in the case of~
Martha, or in the case of Mary, and if ever there had been, it fled away when~
the Lord came in.
