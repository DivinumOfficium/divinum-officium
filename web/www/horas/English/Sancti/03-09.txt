O God, Who along with other gifts of thy grace honored blessed Frances, thy handmaid, with the close companionship of an angel, grant, we beseech thee, that by the help of her intercession we may be made worthy to attain the companionship of angels.

For the confession of Blessed Francisca * let us praise our God.

[Lectio4]
The noble Roman matron Frances A (was born in the year 1384, and) was a pattern~
of godliness from her earliest years. As a child she shrank from games, and set~
no store by the amusements of the world, but delighted to be continually alone~
and engaged in prayer. At the age of eleven years she desired to consecrate her~
virginity to God, and to enter a convent, but humbly yielded obedience to the~
wishes of her parents, and was married to Lawrence de' Pontiani, a young man~
whose rank was equal to his wealth. As a wife she persevered, as far as she~
lawfully could, in her determination to lead an austere life; she abstained as~
much as possible from going to shows, feasts, and such like amusements, dressed~
plainly in woollen stuffs, and spent in prayer or the service of her neighbour~
whatever time she did not occupy with her duties as mistress of her husband's~
house. She strove earnestly to wean the married women of Rome from the vanities~
of the world and the frivolities of dress. To this end she founded during her~
husband's lifetime the Sisterhood of the Oblates, under the rule of the~
Benedictine congregation called of the Mount of Olives. When it pleased God, (in~
the year 1413,) that her husband should be banished, all her goods taken away,~
and her home ruined, she meekly bowed down before His holy will, often repeating~
the words of the blessed Job The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away;~
blessed be the name of the Lord. (i. 21.)

[Lectio5]
On her husband's death she (in 1437) betook herself immediately to the house of~
the Oblates, and, with her feet bare and a rope round her neck, threw herself~
down on the threshold, entreating the sisters with tears to receive her into~
their number. When she obtained her wish, although she was the mother of them~
all, she would be among them only as one that served, glorying rather to be~
called the most degraded of women and a vessel of uncleanness. Her lowly esteem~
of herself was shown both by her word and example. She passed often through the~
city from a vineyard in the country carrying a bundle of sticks on her head, or~
driving an ass laden with faggots; she succoured the needy, for whom she~
collected large alms, and visited the sick in the hospitals, ministering to them~
both food for the body and exhortations healthful for their souls. She strove~
continually to bring her body into subjection by watchings, fastings, haircloth,~
the wearing of an iron girdle, and the often use of a scourge. She never ate but~
once a day, and then only vegetables, and she took no drink but water. These~
severities she however sometimes relaxed, in obedience to her confessor, on~
whose word and wishes she framed her customs.

[Lectio6]
So great was her mental realisation of the things of God, and chiefly of the~
sufferings of the Lord Christ, and so abundant her tears in contemplating them,~
that she seemed sometimes about to sink under her grief. Often when she was~
engaged in prayer, and principally after she had received the Most Holy~
Sacrament of the Eucharist, her spirit became altogether lifted up to God, and~
she remained motionless, carried away by the thought of heavenly things. The~
enemy of man assailed her with diverse reproaches and buffetings to break her off~
her intent, but she feared him not, and with the help of an Angel whom God gave~
her to be her familiar friend, she won a noble victory over the tempter. God~
glorified her with the gifts of healing and of prophecy, whereby she foretold~
things to come, and saw the secrets of the hearts of men. More than once while~
her thoughts were busy in God she remained unwet by streams or rain. When there~
was left only bread enough for three sisters, the Lord at her prayers was~
pleased so to multiply it, that fifteen had enough, and the basket was filled~
again with the fragments. In the month of January also, when the sisters were~
gathering sticks in the country, and were thirsty, she satisfied them abundantly~
with bunches of fresh grapes from a tree. She departed to be with the Lord,~
famous for good works and miracles, in the fifty-sixth year of her age, (upon~
the 9th day of March, in the year of our Lord 1440.) The Supreme Pontiff Paul V.~
caused her to be numbered among the saints.

[Lectio94]
Frances, who was to become a noble Roman matron, had resolved at the age of~
eleven to consecrate her virginity to God and enter a convent, but in obedience~
to her parents she married Lorenzo Ponziani, a wealthy young nobleman. In the~
married state she observed, as far as it was lawful for her to do so, the~
austerities oi the stricter life she had intended to lead; and her endurance in~
adversities.was wonderful to see. To counteract the trend toward worldly display~
and vanity among the married women of Rome, she founded a house for Oblates in~
the City. under the rule of St. Benedict and observed in the congregation of~
Monte Oliveto. When her husband died, she retired immediately to this. house and~
begged humbly to become a member of the community. Her petition was granted, and~
she was made superior of the group, but she preferred to call herself the~
handmaid of all and the most worthless of women. She thwarted the tricks by~
which the devil kept trying to entice her, and with the help of her guardian~
Angel turned every temptation into the occasion of a glorious triumph. Renowned~
for her virtues and miracles, she journeyed to the Lord at age of fifty-six.~
Pope Paul V added her name to the list of the Saints.
