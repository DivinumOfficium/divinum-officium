From the Sermons of St. Bernard, Abbot (of Clairvaux.)
!2nd for All Saints' Day.
Dearly beloved brethren, since we keep on this day the memory of all the Saints,~
that memory so joyous and so worthy of all our thoughts, it seemeth to me worth~
the while, the Holy Ghost helping me, to address to your kind indulgence some~
remarks upon that happiness which they are all enjoying in blessed restfulness,~
and that final consummation they are awaiting. It is a faithful saying, and~
worthy of all acceptation, that if we thus solemnly honour them, we should~
follow the example of their conversation; if we proclaim them so blessed, we~
should strive our best to reach the same blessedness; if we are well pleased to~
hear them praised, we should be bettered by their prayers.

[Lectio5]
What is it to the Saints that we should praise them? What to them that we should~
glorify them? What is this our Feast to them? What are honours on earth to them~
whom, according as the Son hath faithfully promised, His Father is honouring?~
What are our eulogies to them? They are full. Verily, dearly beloved brethren,~
of our goods the Saints have no need, and our devotion toward them doth nothing~
for them. Our honouring their memory hath to do with ourselves and not with~
them. Would ye know what it hath to do with us? In me I confess that at their~
remembrance I feel kindled a vehement longing, yea, a three-fold longing.

[Lectio6]
It is a common saying that out of sight, out of mind. The memory is a kind~
of sight, and to think of the Saints, is to call them up before the mind's eye.~
Such is our portion in the land of the living, but it is not a little portion,~
if love, (as it ought to do,) be joined with remembrance; it is in such sense~
that we must say that our conversation is in heaven. (Phil. iii. 20.) Very~
differently to what is theirs. For they are there actually, where we are only in~
desire; they in very presence, we only in thought.

[Lectio7]
From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 5:1-12
At that time, Jesus seeing the multitudes, went up into a mountain, and when~
he was set down, his disciples came unto him. And so on.

Homily by St. Augustine, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!Bk. i. on the Lord's Sermon. Ch. 4
Wherefore, if we reckon up the Beatitudes as ascending steps, the first is the~
fear of God; the second, godliness; the third, knowledge; the fourth, firmness;~
the fifth, counsel; the sixth, understanding; the seventh, wisdom. The fear of~
God pertaineth unto the lowly, as it is said Blessed are the poor in spirit,~
for their's is the kingdom of heaven, that is, it is for them that are not~
puffed up, for them that are not proud, as also saith the Apostle Be not~
highminded, but fear, (Rom. xi. 20,) that is, Be not puffed up. Godliness~
pertaineth unto the meek; for he that seeketh after a godly sort, honoureth the~
Holy Scripture, and when he findeth therein that which he doth not yet~
understand he blameth not the Scripture, nor gainstandeth. And this is to be~
meek. Therefore is it said here Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit~
the earth.

[Lectio8]
Is knowledge pertaineth unto them that mourn, who have already learnt from the~
Scriptures amid what ills they are entangled, even in those things which once in~
their ignorance they affected as being good and useful. Of such is it said~
Blessed are ye that weep now. (Luke vi. 21.) Firmness pertaineth unto such as~
hunger and thirst after righteousness. These are they who toil bravely, animated~
by the longing for that joy which is caused by real blessedness, and striving~
therefore to wean their love away from so-called joys whose origin is merely~
earthly and fleshly. Of them is it said Blessed are they which do hunger and~
thirst after righteousness. Counsel pertaineth unto the merciful, for our only~
way of escape from the horrors of our own guilt's punishment is that we should~
forgive even as we hope to be ourselves forgiven, and should help others as much~
as we can, even as we would fain be holpen in that wherein we can ourselves do~
nothing. And of such as so do, it is said Blessed are the merciful, for they~
shall obtain mercy from God.

[Lectio9]
Understanding pertaineth unto the pure in heart, for these are they whose clear~
eye can see that which the fleshly eye hath not seen, neither the ear heard,~
neither hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive; and therefore of them~
it is said: Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. Wisdom~
pertaineth unto the peacemakers, even unto them in whom all things are well~
ordered, and passion no longer maketh insurrection against reason, but all~
things are subject unto human common sense, even as the same again is made~
subject unto God. And of such is it said: Blessed are the peacemakers. But for~
all these forms of blessedness there is one and the same reward, although~
diversely named, and that reward is the kingdom of heaven.
