Lesson from the first letter of St. John the Apostle
!1 John 1:1-5
1 That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen~
with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the~
word of life:
2 For the life was manifested; and we have seen and do bear witness, and declare~
unto you the life eternal, which was with the Father, and hath appeared to us:
3 That which we have seen and have heard, we declare unto you, that you also may~
have fellowship with us, and our fellowship may be with the Father, and with his~
Son Jesus Christ.
4 And these things we write to you, that you may rejoice, and your joy may be~
full.
5 And this is the declaration which we have heard from him, and declare unto~
you: That God is light, and in him there is no darkness.

[Responsory1]
R. Right worthy of honour is the blessed Apostle John, who leaned on the Lord's bosom at the Last Supper.
* To Him did Christ upon the Cross commit His mother, virgin to virgin.
V. The Lord chose him for his clean maidenhood, and loved him more than all the~
rest.
R. To him did Christ upon the Cross commit His mother, virgin to virgin.

[Lectio2]
!1 John 1:6-10
6 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and~
do not the truth.
7 But if we walk in the light, as he also is in the light, we have fellowship~
one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all~
sin.
8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in~
us.
9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just, to forgive us our sins, and~
to cleanse us from all iniquity.
10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in~
us.

[Responsory2]
R. This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these~
things.
* And we know that his testimony is true.
V. He drank in the rivers of the Gospel from the Lord's Breast as from an holy~
fountain.
R. And we know that his testimony is true.

[Lectio3]
!1 John 2:1-5
1 My little children, these things I write to you, that you may not sin. But if~
any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the just:
2 And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for~
those of the whole world.
3 And by this we know that we have known him, if we keep his commandments.
4 He who saith that he knoweth him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar,~
and the truth is not in him.
5 But he that keepeth his word, in him in very deed the charity of God is~
perfected.

[Lectio4]
From the Book on Ecclesiastical writers, written by St. Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.) 
!Ch. 9
The Apostle John whom Jesus loved was a son of Zebedee, and brother of the~
Apostle James, who was beheaded by Herod soon after our Lord suffered. He was~
the last of the Evangelists to write his Gospel, which he published at the~
request of the Bishops of Asia, against Cerinthus and other heretics, and~
particularly against the then spreading doctrine of the Ebionites, who asserted~
that Christ had had no existence before Mary. It was therefore needful for the~
Evangelist to declare His Eternal and Divine Generation.

[Responsory4]
R. Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in My temple, saith the Lord,
* And I will write My name upon him, and the name of the city, which is New~
Jerusalem.
V. To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in~
the midst of the Paradise of My God.
R. And I will write My name upon him, and the name of the city, which is New~
Jerusalem.

[Lectio5]
In the fourteenth year after Nero, Domitian stirred up the second persecution,~
and John was exiled to the island of Patmos, where he wrote his Apocalypse,~
which hath been explained by Justin the Martyr and Irenaeus. When Domitian was~
killed, the Senate annulled all his acts, on account of his savage cruelty, and~
the Apostle returned to Ephesus, during the reign of Nerva. He remained at~
Ephesus until the time of Trajan, and founded and governed all the Churches of~
Asia. There, in an extreme old age, he died, in the sixty-eighth year after the~
Lord's passion, and was buried near the city.

[Responsory5]
R. Jesus loved him, because his singular gift of purity made him more worthy of~
love.
* He chose him for a virgin unto Himself, and he remaineth a virgin for ever.
V. At the end, when He was dying upon the Cross, to him did He commit His mother,~
maiden to maiden.
R. He chose him for a virgin unto Himself, and he remaineth a virgin for ever.

[Lectio6]
From the Commentary upon the Epistle to the Galatians, by the same author
!Book 3, Ch. 6
The Blessed Evangelist John lived at Ephesus down to an extreme old age, and, at~
length, when he was with difficulty carried to the Church, and was not able to~
exhort the congregation at length, he was used simply to say at each meeting, My~
little children, love one another. At last the disciples and brethren were weary~
with hearing these words continually, and asked him, Master, wherefore ever~
sayest thou this only? Whereto he replied to them, (worthy of John,) It is the~
commandment of the Lord, and if this only be done, it is enough.

[Responsory6]
R. In the midst of the congregation did the Lord open his mouth.
* And filled him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding.
V. He made him rich with joy and gladness.
R. And filled him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding.
&Gloria
R. And filled him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding.

[Lectio7]
From the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 21:19-24
In that time Jesus said to Peter: Follow me. Peter turning about, saw that~
disciple whom Jesus loved following. And so on.
_
Homily on this passage by St. Augustine, Bishop (of Hippo,)
!124 on the Tract on John
The Church knoweth of two different lives which God hath revealed and blessed~
one is the life of faith, the other the life of knowledge one the life of this~
pilgrimage, the other the life of the eternal mansions; one the life of work,~
the other the life of rest one the life of the journey, the other the life of~
home; one the life of action, the other the life of contemplation. The one~
escheweth evil and doeth good; the other hath no evil to eschew, and only an~
exceeding good to enjoy. The one striveth with the enemy, the other hath no~
enemies, and reigneth.

[Responsory7]
R. In that day will I take thee, O My servant, and will make thee as a signet~
before Me.
* For I have chosen thee, saith the Lord.
V. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.
R. For I have chosen thee, saith the Lord.

[Lectio8]
The one succoureth the needy; the other is where there are no needy to succour. The~
one forgiveth them that trespass against it, that its own trespasses may be~
forgiven; the other neither hath trespasses to forgive nor to be forgiven. The~
one is chastened with evil, lest it be exalted above measure by good; the other~
enjoyeth such a fulness of grace that it feeleth no evil, and cleaveth so firmly~
unto the Highest Good, that it hath no temptation to pride.

[Responsory8]
R. This is that John which leaned on the Lord's Breast at supper
* Even that blessed Apostle unto whom were made known the secret things of~
heaven.
V. He drank in the rivers of the Gospel from the Lord's Breast, as from an holy~
fountain.
R. Even that blessed Apostle unto whom were made known the secret things of~
heaven.
&Gloria
R. Even that blessed Apostle unto whom were made known the secret things of~
heaven.

[Lectio9]
Therefore the one is good, but still sorrowful; the other is better and~
perfectly blessed. And of these two lives there are types, of the one in the~
Apostle Peter, of the other in John. The one laboureth here even unto the end,~
and findeth its end hereafter; the other stretcheth out into the hereafter, and~
in eternity findeth no end. Therefore is it said unto the one, Follow Me; but of~
the other, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? Follow~
thou Me. What is the meaning of these words? who can know? who can understand?~
what is it? is it Follow thou Me, imitating Me in the bearing of earthly sorrow;~
let him tarry till I come again, bringing the everlasting reward?
