[Lectio4]
Clement, the son of Faustinus, was a Roman, from the quarter of the Coelian~
Mount. He was a disciple of the blessed Peter, and is the same concerning whom~
Paul saith, writing to the Philippians And I entreat thee also, true yokefellow,~
help those women which laboured with me in the Gospel, with Clement also, and~
with other my fellow-labourers, whose names are written in the book of life.~
~(iv. 3.) (He succeeded Cletus as Bishop of Rome.) He it was who divided the~
seven quarters of the city among seven scribes, one to each, whose duty it was~
to search out most carefully, and record in writing the sufferings and acts of~
the Martyrs. He himself also wrote much, and that most orthodox and healthy,~
whereby he clearly explained the Christian Religion.

[Lectio5]
His teaching and the holiness of his life brought many to believe in Christ, and~
he was therefore exiled by the Emperor Trajan to Kherson, in the Crimea, where~
he found two thousand Christians, who had been condemned by the same Trajan.~
There they all worked in the marble quarries. During their labour they suffered~
for want of water, and Clement prayed, and then went up an hill hard by, on the~
top whereof he saw a Lamb standing, touching with its right foot a flowing~
spring of sweet waters. Therewith they all quenched their thirst, and by this~
miracle many unbelievers were brought to believe in Christ, and began to honour~
the holiness of Clement.

[Lectio6]
These things moved Trajan to send a messenger to the Crimea, who tied an anchor~
about Clement's neck, and cast him into the deep of the sea. After it had been~
done, while the Christians were praying on the shore, the sea went back three~
miles, and when they followed it, they found a grotto of marble, in form like a~
temple, and therein a stone coffin wherein was laid the body of the Martyr, and,~
hard by, the anchor wherewith he had been sunk. Then were the country people~
moved to receive the faith of Christ. The body of Clement was afterwards brought~
to Rome, in the time of Pope Nicholas I, and buried in his own Church. A Church~
was also built in the Crimea, in the place where God had made the water to break~
forth. Clement lived as Pope nine years, six months, and six days. He held two~
Ordinations in the month of December, wherein he made ten Priests, two Deacons,~
and fifteen Bishops for diverse places.

[Lectio93]
!Commemoration for the Holy Martyr Felicity.
The Lesson is taken from the Sermons of Pope St. Gregory (the Great.)
!3rd Horn, on the Gospels.
That blessed woman Felicity, whose Birth-feast we are keeping today, had as~
much dread of leaving her seven sons living after her in the flesh, as have~
carnal-minded mothers of seeing them go dead before them. When she was taken in~
the strong pains of persecution, she braced up the hearts of her children by~
bidding them cleave to the Fatherland above, and became their mother for the~
spiritual, as she had aforetime been for the fleshly life, bringing them forth~
for God by her exhortation, as she had brought them forth for the world by her~
body. And shall I not call this woman a Martyr? Nay, more than Martyr. The seven~
whom she trusted to God were seven children sent before her to death. She~
suffered first and triumphed last.

As he began to move toward the sea * the people cried out with a loud voice: O~
Lord Jesus Christ, deliver him! And Clement wept, and said: Father, receive my~
spirit!
