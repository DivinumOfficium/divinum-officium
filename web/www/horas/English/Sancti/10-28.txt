[Oratio]
O God, Who didst use thine holy Apostles Simon and Jude to make known unto us~
thy Name, grant unto us so to profit by their doctrine as to do honour to their~
everlasting glory, and so to honour that glory as to gain profit to ourselves.
$Per Dominum

[Lectio4]
Simon the Canaanite, called also Zelotes, went through Egypt preaching the~
Gospel, whileas the like was done in Mesopotamia by Thaddaeus, called also in~
the Gospel Judas the brother of James, and the writer of one of the Catholic~
Epistles. They met together afterwards in Persia, where they begat countless~
children in Jesus Christ, spread the faith far and wide in those lands, amid~
raging heathens, and glorified together by their teaching and miracles, and, in~
the end, by a glorious martyrdom, the most holy name of Jesus Christ.

From the holy Gospel according to John
!John 15:17-25
at that time, Jesus said to his disciples: These things I command you, that you love one another. If the world hate you,~
know ye, that it hath hated me before you. And so on.
_
Homily by St. Augustine, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!87th Tract on John
In the reading from the Gospel, the last before this, the Lord had said: Ye~
have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go,~
and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye~
shall ask of the Father in My Name, He may give it you. And here He saith~
These things I command you, that ye love one another. And by this it is that we~
must understand what fruit from us it is, whereof He saith I have chosen,~
that ye should go, and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain, and~
so the words added That whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in My Name, He may~
give it you. He will give unto us when we love one another, since this (mutual~
love) is itself the gift of Him Who hath chosen us when as yet we were fruitless,~
since it hath not been we who have chosen Him, (but He Who hath chosen us,) and~
ordained us, that we should go, and bring forth fruit, that is to say, should~
love one another.

[Lectio8]
Love then, is the fruit which we should bring forth, and the Apostle Paul~
telleth us (1 Tim. i. 5) that this love is love out of a pure heart, and of a~
good conscience, and of faith unfeigned. This is the love wherewith we love our~
neighbour, the love wherewith we love God, for we do not really love our~
neighbour unless we love God. For if any man love God, he loveth his neighbour~
as himself, since he that loveth not God loveth not himself. For on these two~
commandments hangeth all the law and the Prophets. Love, then, is the fruit~
which we should bring forth. And concerning this fruit, the Lord giveth us this~
commandment These things (saith He) I command you, that ye love one another.~
Hence also the Apostle Paul (Gal. v. 22) when he is about praising up the fruits~
of the Spirit as opposed to the works of the flesh, saith first of all: The~
fruit of the Spirit is love. And from that as the beginning he draweth out a~
string of other fruits, as thence begotten and thereto bound, namely, joy, peace,~
long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance, chastity.

[Lectio9]
Who is really joyful that loveth not the cause of his joy? Who can really be at~
one with another, unless he loveth that other? Who is cheerful under long toil~
for a good work, unless he loveth the aim? Who is kind, unless he love the~
object of his tenderness? Who is good, unless by the persuasion of love? Who is~
truly faithful, unless by the faith which worketh by love? Who is gentle to any~
use, unless love move him? Who turneth away from baseness unless he love honour?~
Well, then, doth the Good Master so often command us to love, as though that~
commandment were all-sufficient, for love is that gift without which all other~
good things avail nothing, and which cannot be without having every other good~
gift which maketh a good man good.
