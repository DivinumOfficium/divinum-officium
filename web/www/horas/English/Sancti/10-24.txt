From the Book of Tobias
!Tob 12:1-4
1 Then Tobias called to him his son, and said to him: What can we give to this~
holy man, that is come with thee?
2 Tobias answering, said to his father: Father, what wages shall we give him? or~
what can be worthy of his benefits?
3 He conducted me and brought me safe again, he received the money of Gabelus,~
he caused me to have my wife, and he chased from her the evil spirit, he gave~
joy to her parents, myself he delivered from being devoured by the fish, thee~
also he hath made to see the light of heaven, and we are filled with all good~
things through him. What can we give him sufficient for these things?
4 But I beseech thee, my father, to desire him, that he would vouchsafe to~
accept one half of all things that have been brought.

[Responsory1]
R. At that time the prayers of them twain were heard in the presence of the~
glory of the Most High God;
* And holy Raphael, the Angel of the Lord, was sent to heal the twain of them,~
whose prayers had been uttered at one time in the presence of the Lord.
V. Tobias and Sara were in tribulation, and began to pray with tears.
R. And holy Raphael, the Angel of the Lord, was sent to heal the twain of them,~
whose prayers had been uttered at one time in the presence of the Lord.

[Lectio2]
!Tob 12:5-13
5 So the father and the son, calling him, took him aside: and began to desire~
him that he would vouchsafe to accept of half of all things that they had~
brought.
6 Then he said to them secretly: Bless ye the God of heaven, give glory to him~
in the sight of all that live, because he hath shewn his mercy to you.
7 For it is good to hide the secret of a king: but honourable to reveal and~
confess the works of God.
8 Prayer is good with fasting and alms more than to lay up treasures of gold:
9 For alms delivereth from death, and the same is that which purgeth away sins,~
and maketh to find mercy and life everlasting.
10 But they that commit sin and iniquity, are enemies to their own soul.
11 I discover then the truth unto you, and I will not hide the secret from you.
12 When thou didst pray with tears, and didst bury the dead, and didst leave thy~
dinner, and hide the dead by day in thy house, and bury them by night, I offered~
thy prayer to the Lord.
13 And because thou wast acceptable to God, it was necessary that temptation~
should prove thee.

[Responsory2]
R. When Tobias went forth he found a very well-favoured young man standing with~
his loins girded, and as it were ready to set forth, and he saluted him and said:
* Whence art thou, O good young man?
V. And he knew not that it was an Angel of the Lord, and saluted him, and said:
R. Whence art thou, O good young man?

[Lectio3DA]
!Tob 12:14-22
14 And now the Lord hath sent me to heal thee, and to deliver Sara thy son's~
wife from the devil.
15 For I am the angel Raphael, one of the seven, who stand before the Lord.
16 And when they had heard these things, they were troubled, and being seized~
with fear they fell upon the ground on their face.
17 And the angel said to them: Peace be to you, fear not.
18 For when I was with you, I was there by the will of God: bless ye him, and~
sing praises to him.
19 I seemed indeed to eat and to drink with you: but I use an invisible meat and~
drink, which cannot be seen by men.
20 It is time therefore that I return to him that sent me: but bless ye God, and~
publish all his wonderful works.
21 And when he had said these things, he was taken from their sight, and they~
could see him no more.
22 Then they lying prostrate for three hours upon their face, blessed God: and~
rising up, they told all his wonderful works.

From the Sermons of St. Bonaventure, the Bishop
!De Sanctis Angelis Sermo 5, sub fine
Raphael means God's healing, and we should observe that the way out of evil lies through three blessing bestowed on us through Raphael's healing. For Raphael the Healer leads us forth from weakness of soul and brings us into the bitterness of contrition; whence in the book of Tobit Raphael says: When thou enterest into thy house, anoint his eyes with gall. He did so, and he saw. Why could not Raphael do this himself? Because an Angel does not bestow compunction, but he shows the way to it. By gall, the bitterness of contrition is to be understood, for it heals the inner eyes of the mind. The Psalmist says: He healeth those that are broken in heart. This is the best eye salve. In the second chapter of the Book of Judges it is written that an angel came up to the place of the weepers, and said to the people: I made you to go up out of Egypt; I have done all of these good things for you: and all the people wept, so that the place was called the Place of the Weepers. Dearly beloved, all day long the Angels are telling us of God's blessings, and recalling them to our minds: Who hath created thee? Who hath redeemed thee? What hast thou done? Whom hast thou offended? When thou considerest this, thine only remedy is to weep.

[Responsory4]
R. Tobias asked the Angel: Of what house, or of what tribe, art thou? And he~
answered and said:
* I am Azarias, the son of Ananias the Great.
V. Dost thou seek for a tribe or family, or an hired man to go with thy son? But~
be not careful overmuch.
R. I am Azarias, the son of Ananias the Great.

[Lectio5]
Secondly, Raphael brings us forth from our slavery to the devil, by recalling
Christ's Passion to our mind. There is a figure of the Passion in the sixth chapter of Tobit, where it is said that if a piece of the heart is put on the embers, its smoke will drive out all kinds of devils. It is said in the eighth chapter of Tobit that Tobias put a piece of the heart on the embers, and Raphael bound the devil in the utmost parts of Egypt. What does this mean? Was Raphael unable to bind the devil unless the heart was put on the embers? Surely a fish's heart could not give such strength to an Angel? By no means! It would be impossible unless there was a mystery in this. We are to understand that nothing so frees us from the devil's slavery as the Passion of Christ, which issued from the root of his heart, or of his love. For the heart is the fountain, or hot centre, of all life. Therefore if thou puttest the heart of Christ, that is the Passion, that he underwent, issuing from the root of charity and the fountain of heat, on the embers, that is, on the flame of memory: then immediately the devil will be bound, and he will be unable to hurt thee.

[Responsory5]
R. Tobias went out to wash his feet, and behold a great fish went out, and would~
have devoured him; and he was sore afraid, and cried out with a loud voice, and~
said: O sir, he assaileth me. And the Angel said unto him: Take him by his~
gill, and draw him unto thee.
* Open this fish, and take his heart, and his liver, and his gall, and put them~
up safely by thee, for they are useful and needful for drugs.
V. And Tobias drew the fish unto the dry ground, and it began to gasp at his~
feet, and the Angel said unto him.
R. Open this fish, and take his heart, and his liver, and his gall, and put them~
safely by thee, for they are useful and needful for drugs.

[Lectio6]
Thirdly Raphael delivers us from God's displeasure, which we incur by transgressing against God; he does this by leading us to instant prayer: and this is what Raphael said to Tobit in the twelfth chapter: When thou didst pray with tears, I did bring your prayers before the Lord. For the Angels reconcile us to God, as far as they are able. The devils are accusers before God, but the angels excuse us, when they offer our prayers, and when they urge us to pray devoutly. In the eighth chapter of the Revelation of St. John it is said: The smoke of the incense ascended up before God out of the Angels hand. This sweet smelling incense is the prayer of the saints. Does thou wish to appease God, whom thou hast offended ? Then pray devoutly. They offer thy prayer, so that they may reconcile thee to God. It is said in the Gospel of St. Luke, that Christ being in an agony, prayed more earnestly, and there appeared an Angel of the Lord strengthening him. And all of this was done for our sake: for he had no need of strengthening, but it was to show that the Angels willingly assist those who pray devoutly, and help and strengthen them, and bring their prayers before God. 

[Responsory6]
R. The Angel Raphael said unto Tobias: When thou enterest into thine house,~
straightway worship the Lord thy God; and when thou hast given thanks unto Him,~
draw near unto thy father and kiss him.
* And forthwith smear upon his eyes some of the gall of the fish which thou~
carriest with thee; for know that his eyes will straightway be opened, and thy~
father shall see the light of heaven, and shall behold thee, and be glad.
V. Take with thee some of the gall of the fish, for it will be needful.
R. And forthwith smear upon his eyes some of the gall of the fish which thou~
carriest with thee; for know that his eyes will straightway be opened, and thy~
father shall see the light of heaven, and shall behold thee, and be glad.
&Gloria
R. And forthwith smear upon his eyes some of the gall of the fish which thou~
carriest with thee; for know that his eyes will straightway be opened, and thy~
father shall see the light of heaven, and shall behold thee, and be glad.

[Lectio7]
From the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 5:1-4
At that time: There was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.~
And so on.
_
Homily by St. John Chrystostom 
!Hom. 35 or 36 on John 
What manner of mystery is this? What does it reveal? for it is not written without a purpose: but the future is foretold in figure and similitude lest the unexpected occurrence of a wondrous event should in any way disturb the faith of the hearers. What, then is here described? In the future a baptism was to be given, full of power and of the greatest grace, a baptism that would wash away all sin, that would restore life to dead men. These facts then are depicted figuratively, in the pool and in all the other circumstances. And first in this figure the water is set forth, which washes away stains of the body, and those things that are not actually dirty, though they were thought to be so, such as coming in contact with a corpse, or a leper, and such like: it is to be seen that many things under the old law are cleansed by water, in accordance with this idea. 

[Responsory7]
R. The Angel Raphael said: Bless ye the God of heaven, and confess Him before~
all living;
* For He hath had mercy upon you.
V. Bless Him, and praise Him, and tell of all His marvellous works.
R. For He hath had mercy upon you.

[Lectio8]
But let us now return to the subject. First defilements of the body are washed out, and then God heals various infirmities by means of water. For because God would bring us nearer to the grace of baptism, he not only cleanses defilements but heals diseases. For those figures which come nearest to the reality, in baptism, the Passion, and others are seen more clearly than the older ones. For it is the same with those who form a king's bodyguard: they are more splendidly apparelled than those at the other end of his equipage. And the angel came down and troubled the water, and imbued it with healing power; so that the Jews might learn that the Lord of Angels had far more power to heal all the diseases of the soul. But just as here it was not simply the natural property of the water that healed, (otherwise it would have always have done so) but it happened through the work of the Angel: so it is not simply water that works on us, but after the water has received the grace of the Spirit, then it looses us from all sin.

[Responsory8]
R. It is time for me to return unto Him That sent me, saith the Angel Raphael;
* But bless ye the Lord, and tell of all His marvellous works.
V. Confess Him before all living, for He hath had mercy upon you.
R. Bless ye the Lord, and tell of all His marvellous works.
&Gloria
R. Bless ye the Lord, and tell of all His marvellous works.

[Lectio9]
Around this pool lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. But then those who wished for healing were prevented by infirmity from receiving it, while now everyone is able to come forward. For the Angel does not trouble the water, but the Lord of Angels brings all things to come to pass. We may no longer say, While I am coming, another steppeth down before me. But even should the whole world come, the grace would not be used up, neither would its power nor effectual working come to an end. For as the sun's rays shine forth each day without burning out, and as they spread abroad without losing any of their light: far less is the operation of the Spirit diminished by the multitudes who receive it. Now this miracle took place so that as men learned that could heal bodily diseases, and as they become accustomed to this fact over a period of time: so they might they the more readily believe that it could also heal diseases of the soul. 
&teDeum

[Hymnus Laudes]
v. O Christ, Redeemer of us all,
Protect thy servants when they call,
And hear with reconciling care
The Blessed Virgin's holy prayer.
_
Be ever present, Angel high,
Whose name doth healing signify:
From bodily ills protect us sure,
And keep our souls in health secure.
_
And ye, O ever blissful throng
Of heavenly spirits, guardians strong,
Our past and present ills dispel,
From future peril shield us well.
_
From lands wherein thy faithful dwell
Drive far the trait'rous infidel;
So we to Christ due hymns of praise
Henceforth with gladsome hearts we raise.
_
To God the Father, praise be done,
Who doth redeem us by his Son,
Anoint us by his Holy Ghost,
And guard us by his Angel-host.
Amen.
