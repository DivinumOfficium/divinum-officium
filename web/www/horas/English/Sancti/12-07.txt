[Oratio]
O God, who didst give unto thy people blessed Ambrose to be a minister of eternal~
salvation; grant, we beseech thee, that we may be found worthy to have the same~
as an intercessor in heaven, whom we have had for a teacher of life upon earth.

[Lectio4]
Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, was the son of another Ambrose, a Roman citizen, and~
was born when his father was Prefect of Gaul, (about the year of our Lord 340.) A~
swarm of bees settled upon his face when he was in his cradle, which was~
considered an omen of his future eloquence. He received a liberal education at~
Rome. He was afterwards, under the Prefect Probus, made governor of Liguria and~
Emilia, and so came with authority to Milan. Auxentius, an Arian, who had been~
intruded into the Bishopric of Milan, happening to die, the most violent~
disputes arose about the choice of a successor. Ambrose came to the church in~
his official capacity, and urged upon the contending factions, in a long and~
powerful speech, the necessity of keeping the public peace; whereupon a child~
suddenly cried out, Ambrose, Bishop, and the whole assembly took it up, and~
unanimously called for his election.

[Lectio5]
Ambrose refused, and would not yield to their prayers, whereupon they carried~
their petition to the Emperor Valentinian. It was very pleasing to this Prince~
that those he had appointed as judges should be chosen Bishops, as also to the~
Prefect Probus, who had, as it were prophetically, said to him when he appointed~
him, Go and govern them more like a Bishop than a Judge. When the will of the~
Emperor was added to the desire of the people, Ambrose yielded, and received~
Baptism, (for hitherto he was only a Catechumen,) Confirmation, and Communion,~
and then the several Orders on successive days, till on the eighth day, which~
was the 7th of December, (in the year 374,) the weight of the Episcopate was~
laid upon his shoulders. Being made Bishop, he showed himself a stout upholder~
of the Catholic faith, and the discipline of the Church, and turned to the truth~
great numbers of Arians and other heretics, and, among them, he begat in Christ~
Jesus that burning and shining light of the Church, Augustine.

[Lectio6]
After the murder of the Emperor Gratian, (in 383,) Ambrose was sent as an~
ambassador to Maximus, by whom he had been slain, and, as he refused to repent,~
the Bishop renounced his communion. After the massacre which the Emperor~
Theodosius had commanded at Thessalonica, (in 390,) he refused to permit that~
Prince to enter a church. The Emperor pleaded that he was no worse than David,~
who had been guilty of adultery and murder, to which Ambrose answered him, As~
thou hast followed him in his sin, follow him also in his repentance. Then~
Theodosius humbly did public penance laid upon him by the Bishop. At length the~
Saint was worn out with his continual labour and care for the Church, (for the~
which also he composed many excellent books,) and foretold that the day of his~
death was at hand, though he had not then fallen into his last sickness. As he~
lay dying, Honoratus, Bishop of Vercelli, heard a voice from God three times~
crying to him that the hour of Ambrose's departure was come, whereupon he went~
to him quickly, and gave him the sacred Body of our Lord. When he had received~
It, the Saint, still praying, with his hands stretched out in the form of a~
cross, gave his spirit to God, upon the 4th day of April, in the year of Christ,~
397.

The Lesson is taken from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 5:13-19
At that time: Jesus said unto his disciples: Ye are the salt of the earth: But if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? And so on, and that which followeth.
_
Homily by St. Augustine the Bishop (of Hippo)
!Book 1 of the Lord's Sermon on the Mount, ch. 6, vol. 4
The Lord would have us understand how that men do lose their power of savouring others with righteousness when they are willing to place their eternal welfare in jeopardy for the sake of any temporal advantage, like as attainment of ease or luxury, or escape from suffering or toil. For that which is eternal, unlike things of this world, can neither be bestowed by men, nor by them taken away. Hence, when he asketh: If the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? he would have us understand the question to be: If ye, by whom mankind is preserved from corruption, be willing to lose the kingdom of heaven so as to escape trials or persecutions in this world, who is there to preserve you from corruption, seeing ye are they that God hath chosen  to preserve all others from corruption?

[Lectio8]
Those that should be the salt of the earth, but have lost their savour, are thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men. But no one that suffereth persecution is truly said to be trodden under foot of men. Rather, that one is truly trodden under foot of men who through fear of persecution hath lost the savour of righteousness. For no one can be trodden upon, unless he be beneath him which treadeth upon him.  And certainly no one who hath his heart in heaven, no matter how grievously he doth suffer in his body on earth, is rightly said to be beneath anyone who misuseth him.

[Lectio9]
Ye are the light of the world. And we are to understand the word World in the same sense as the word Earth when he spoke above of the salt of the earth, that is, not that earth whereupon we walk with our bodily feet, but the men which dwell upon the earth; in other words, sinners, for the sweetening and correction of whose corruption, the Lord hath sent his Apostles, as it were, as so much salt. And so by the world we are to understand, not the heaven and the earth, but the men who are in the world and love the world, for the enlightening of whom the Apostles have been sent. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid: that is, what is founded upon the heights of righteousness, whereof the mountain upon which the Lord gave this discourse was itself a figure, is magnificent in the eyes of all men.

[Lectio94]
Ambrose, bishop of Milan, son of Ambrose, who was a Roman citizen, was educated~
in the City in the liberal arts. Appointed by the prefect Probus to govern~
Liguria and Aemilia at his order and with his authority. Ambrose went to Milan,~
where Auxentius, the Arian bishop, had died and the people were quarreling about~
the choice of a successor. In the exercise of his official duty, Ambrose went~
into the church to quell the riot that had arisen and, when he had spoken at~
length and eloquently on the peace and tranquility of the state, suddenly a~
boy's voice exclaimed, "Ambrose bishop!" Then the whole populace with one voice~
demanded that he be elected. And so he received baptism (for he had been only a~
catechumen), the other sacraments of the Christian initiation, all the degrees~
of orders according to the custom of the Church, and was raised to the dignity~
of the episcopate. In carrying of his office, he courageously defended the~
Catholic faith and the discipline of the Church both in speech and in writing,~
and converted many Arians and other heretics to the faith, among whom was St.~
Augustine, whom he begot to Christ Jesus as his spiritual child. Worn out by all~
his labors and cares for the Church of God, he died on April 4 in the year 397.
