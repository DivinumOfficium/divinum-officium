O God, Who didst glorify thy blessed Confessor and Bishop Titus with the graces~
of an Apostle, grant unto us for his sake and at his prayers, that we may so~
live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world, that hereafter we~
may worthily attain unto the Fatherland which is in heaven.

[Lectio4]
The Apostle Paul had no sooner by his preaching gathered the Cretans to the~
Sacraments and doctrines of the Christian Faith, than he made Titus their~
Bishop. It is agreed that the holiness of Titus shone with so bright a light~
before the infant Church, that he earned fellowship with the disciples of the~
Teacher of the Gentiles. Being taken to share in the work of preaching, he so~
endeared himself to Paul by his faithfulness and zeal in declaring the Gospel,~
that the Apostle saith When I came to Troas to preach Christ's Gospel, and a~
door was opened unto me of the Lord, I had no rest in my spirit, because I found~
not Titus my brother but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into~
Macedonia. (2 Cor. ii. 12, 13.) And again he saith: When we were come into~
Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without~
were fightings, within were fears. Nevertheless, God, that comforteth those that~
are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus. (vii. 5, 6.)

[Lectio5]
It was this affection of Paul toward Titus, which had induced him to send him to~
Corinth upon a Mission which mainly concerned the collection of alms from the~
charity of the faithful for the relief of the poor Hebrew Saints at Jerusalem.~
This mission Titus discharged with such wisdom and gentleness, that he not only~
strengthened the Corinthians in the faith, but also stirred up in them an~
earnest desire, a mourning, a fervent mind toward Paul, their earliest teacher.~
~(vii. 7.) Many were the other journeys by land and sea which Titus undertook in~
order to sow the seed of God's word among men of diverse nations, tongues, and~
countries. Filled with bold loyalty to the banner of the Cross, he went with~
Paul to the island of Crete. Of the Church of Crete the Apostle himself made him~
the first Bishop; and we may not doubt that, as such, he was what his Teacher~
bade him be, in all things showing himself a pattern of good works, in doctrine,~
in uncorruptness, in gravity. (Tit 2:7)

Like a candle, he gave forth the light of faith in the midst of men sitting in~
the darkness of idolatry and falsehood, as in the shadow of death. He is said to~
have sweated mightily to unfurl the banner of the Cross among the Dalmatians. He~
was full of days and good works, when, upon a 4th of January, in the 94th year~
of his age, he died one of those deaths which are precious in the sight of the~
Lord. He was buried in the Church of which the Apostle had made him the~
minister. His praises have been mostly written by St. John Chrysostom and St~
Jerome. The 4th of January is the day upon which his name is read in the Roman~
Martyrology, but Pope Pius IX. assigned for his Festival, to be kept with an~
Office and Mass by the clergy secular and regular throughout the Catholic world,~
the first free day afterwards.

[Lectio93]
!Commemoration for St. Dorothy.
The maiden Dorothy, of Caesarea in Cappadocia, was betrayed to Apricius the~
President by her two sisters, Chrysta and Callista, who had denied the faith, in~
the hope that he would induce her to do likewise. She was arrested, but it came~
not to pass as they hoped. On the contrary, she brought them back to the~
Christian worship, and they received martyrdom. She was long tormented upon the~
rack, and scourged with palm branches, and in the end was beheaded, receiving the~
double palm of virginity and martyrdom.

Titus, bishop of Crete, had the privilege of being associated with the disciples of~
the Doctor of the Gentiles. He was so particularly dear to Paul for his zeal in~
preaching the Gospel and for his faithfulness that, when Paul had gone to Troas~
for the sake of the Gospel of Christ, he declared that his spirit had no rest~
because he had not found his brother Titus there. And a little later, on his way~
to Macedonia, he confirmed his love for Titus by writing, "But God, who comforts~
the humble, comforted us by the arrival of Titus." The Apostle sent him to~
Corinth, and he carried out with great wisdom his commission there, which was~
particularly for the purpose of collecting alms to aid the needy Church of the~
Hebrews. In the meantime, to spread the seed of the divine word among peoples of~
different places and languages, after many journeys and toils under Paul's~
leadership, he reached the island of Crete. Later, when he was made bishop of~
this Church by the Apostle himself, he gave an example of good works. It is said~
that he went to Dalmatia and made great efforts there to unfurl the standard of~
the Cross. At length full of merits, he died in the Lord at the age of~
ninety-four years.
