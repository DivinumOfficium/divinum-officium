[Oratio]
O God, Who dost continually raise up in thy Church new examples of godly living,~
grant unto thy people so to follow in the steps of thy blessed Bishop and~
Confessor Andrew, that at the last they may, together with him, attain unto thine~
eternal reward.

[Lectio4]
This Andrew was born at Florence, of the noble family of Corsini, (upon the 30th~
day of November, in the year 1302.) His birth was a special answer to prayer,~
and his parents vowed him to the Blessed Virgin. God fore-showed even before his~
birth what he was to be. While his mother was great with child she dreamt that~
she brought forth a wolf, which ran to the Carmelite Church and was changed into a~
lamb as soon as it reached the porch. The lad was brought up in godliness and~
learning becoming his rank, but turned to bad courses; wherefore his mother~
often rebuked him. Nevertheless, when he knew how his parents had vowed him to~
the Maiden Mother of God, the love of God touched his heart, and the vision of~
his mother moving him, he betook himself to the Institute of the Carmelites. In~
that place the devil exercised him with many and diverse temptations, but could~
not break him off from his determination to profess as a friar. He was soon~
after sent to Paris, where he finished his studies at the University, and took~
his degree; after which he returned to his own country, and was set over the~
houses of his order in Tuscany.

[Lectio5]
The Bishop of Fiesole being dead, the Church in that place chose Andrew Corsini~
for his successor. He held himself altogether unworthy of that office, and for a~
long time lay hidden and unknown, till he was betrayed by the voice of a child~
marvellously speaking, and found outside the city. Then, lest he should seem to~
resist the Will of God, he took the Bishopric, (in the year 1360.) Being~
dignified with this office, he set himself to a more perfect exercise of the.~
virtue of lowliness, whereof he was already a diligent practiser. He was eminent~
in watchfulness over the flock committed to his charge, joining thereto great~
tenderness and liberality towards the poor. He continued instant in prayer and~
watching. Thus was he so adorned with these and many other virtues, and even~
with the gift of prophecy, that the fame of his holy life was in the mouths of~
all men.

[Lectio6]
Urban V., moved by the fame of his godly conversation, sent him as his Legate to~
quiet disturbances at Bologna. He endured much in the discharge of this duty,~
calming with great wisdom the angry passions of the citizens, who had broken out~
into civil war, and when peace was restored, he returned home. Shortly after, he~
received from the Blessed Virgin a warning of his approaching death, and being~
worn out with his unceasing toil, and the rigour of his voluntary mortifications,~
he passed to the kingdom of heaven, (upon the 6th day of January,) in the year~
of our Lord 1373, and the 71st of his own age. His name became illustrious for~
many and great miracles, and Urban VIII. enrolled him in the number of the~
Saints. His body resteth at Florence in the Church of his Order, and is looked~
on with great reverence by the citizens, to whom, even in these days, he hath~
more than once shown himself a protector.

[Lectio94]
Andrew, of the noble family of the Corsini of Florence, was born in answer to his~
parents' prayer to God, and dedicated to the Mother of God. He was brought up~
devoutly in his youth, yet was inclined to evil ways and often rebuked by his~
mother. But when he realized that he had been dedicated to the Virgin by his~
parents' vow, he became fired with the love of God and joined the Carmelite~
Order, becoming its superior in Etruria. In the meantime, the Church of Fiesole~
had been widowed of its shepherd, and elected Andrew as its bishop. He finally~
agreed to undertake this office, lest he should go against the will of God, and~
carried it out with the greatest zeal for souls and with pastoral solicitude.~
Urban V sent him as his legate to Bologna to restore order among the seditious~
populace, and with the greatest prudence he managed to extinguish the mortal~
feuds among its citizens. Worn out with his unceasing toils and sufferings he~
slept in peace in the year 1377, at the age of seventy-one, and Urban VIII~
enrolled him among the Saints.
