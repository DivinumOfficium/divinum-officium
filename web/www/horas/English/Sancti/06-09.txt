Make us, O Lord, we beseech thee, ever heartily to rejoice over thine holy~
martyrs Primus and Felician, and grant to us at their prayer the gift of thy~
safe-keeping.

[Lectio93]
Primus and Felician were two brothers who were accused of Christianity during~
the persecution by Diocletian and Maximian, and thrown into irons, which an~
angel broke, and so freed their limbs. In the presence of the Praetor they most~
earnestly clave to the profession of their faith, and were immediately parted~
one from the other. Felician's was the steadfastness which was first tried in~
diverse ways. They, however, that strove to argue him into sin, when they found~
that words availed nothing, fastened his hands and feet to a post, and left him~
to hang there three days without food or drink. On the fourth day the Praetor~
called Primus before him, and said to him Seest thou how much thy brother is~
wiser than thou He hath obeyed the Emperors, and they have made him~
honourable. Thou hast only to follow his example to be made partaker of his~
honours and favours. Primus answered him: What hath befallen my brother I know,~
for an angel hath told me. God grant that, seeing I have the same will that he~
hath, I may not be divided from him in uplifting of testimony. These words~
raised the wrath of the Praetor, and to the torments which he had already~
inflicted on Primus, he added this also, that he had boiling lead put into his~
mouth, compelling his brother Felician to be present and see it done. After that,~
he had them led into the theatre and two lions let loose upon them, in the~
presence of about twelve thousand people who were gathered together to see the~
show. The lions only fawned upon the knees of the Saints, making friends with~
them with motions of their heads and tails. This exhibition turned five hundred~
persons and their households to Christ. The Praetor, then, moved beyond all~
endurance by what had passed, caused Primus and Felician to be beheaded.
