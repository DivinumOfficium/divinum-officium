Grant, we beseech thee, O Almighty God, that the example of thy Saints may continually stir us up to amend our sinful lives, that as we do solemnly commemorate them, we may also sincerely strive to imitate them.

[Lectio4]
This Hilary was born of a noble family in Aquitaine, and is distinguished as a~
divine and an orator. He was married in his earlier life, but even then lived~
the life of a monk and on account of his remarkable holiness, was ultimately~
made Bishop of Poitiers, (about the year 353,) in which office he did his duty~
so as to gain the universal praise of the faithful. At that time the Emperor~
Constantius was persecuting the Catholics by threats, by the plundering of their~
goods, by exile, and at length, by every species of cruelty, in order to force~
them to yield to the Arian heresy. Against the Arians Hilary set himself up as a~
brazen wall, and turned upon himself the fierceness of their anger. They~
assailed him by many artifices, and at last Saturnine, Bishop of Aries, at the~
Council of Beziers, (in 356,) procured his banishment to Phrygia. During this~
exile he raised a dead man to life, and wrote a work in twelve books on the~
Trinity, against the Arians.

[Lectio5]
In (the year 359,) the fourth of his exile, took place the Council of Seleucia~
in Isauria, at which Hilary was obliged to be present, but afterwards withdrew~
to Constantinople. Here he realised more sharply the awful nature of this crisis~
in the history of Christianity, published three pamphlets in the form of letters~
to the Emperor, and demanded from that Prince leave to hold a public disputation~
in his presence. The Arian Bishops Ursacius and Valens, whom Hilary had already~
confuted in writing, were afraid to meet him in debate, and therefore induced~
Constantius, under pretence of pardon, to send him back to his Bishopric, (in~
360.) His mother, the Church of Gaul, to use the language of Jerome, received~
him with open arms on his return from the battle with the heretics. He was~
followed to Poitiers by Martin, afterwards Bishop of Tours, whose after holiness~
was a fruit of his teaching.

[Lectio6]
Henceforth he ruled the Church of Poitiers in great peace. By his exertions the~
Church of Gaul was led to denounce the Arian blasphemy. His wonderful learning~
is seen in his numerous works, of which Jerome write to Laeta that he deemeth~
them quite faultless. One can follow Hilary in his books, saith he, without~
tripping once. He passed from earth to heaven upon the thirteenth day of January,~
in the year of our Lord 369, in the reign of the Emperors Valentinian and~
Valens. He had already been called an illustrious Doctor of the Church, by many~
Fathers and Councils, and was so styled in the Liturgy in some Dioceses, when at~
length, (in the year 1850,) Pope Pius IX., at the prayer of the Synod of~
Bordeaux, and in accordance with a resolution of the Sacred Congregation of~
Rites, proclaimed and confirmed the title, and commanded that the Mass and~
Office of his Feast should be everywhere said as those of a Doctor.

[Lectio93]
!Commemoration for St. Felix, Priest and Martyr.
Felix was a Priest of Nola, who on account of his fiery zeal against idolatry,~
suffered much persecution from the heathens, and was cast into prison. From~
thence an angel delivered him by night, and bade him go to Maximian, Bishop of~
Nola. This Bishop, enfeebled by old age, had at length despaired of power to~
withstand the torments of the persecutors, and had hidden, himself in a wood.~
Thither came Felix, by the will of God, and found the holy bishop lying~
half-dead upon the ground. He succoured him, and carried him upon his shoulders~
to the house of an holy widow. On another occasion, Felix, having again provoked~
the anger of the devil-worshippers, became an object of their pursuit, from~
which he hid himself in a narrow place between two walls. Hardly had he entered,~
when some spiders wove their webs across the entrance, which the enemy~
perceiving, concluded that no man had entered, and passed by. After leaving this~
hiding-place, Felix lay for three months in the house of an holy woman. After~
the Lord gave peace to His Church, the Saint returned to Nola, where he turned~
many to Christ by his life, his preaching, and his miracles. He steadily refused~
to accept the Bishopric, fell asleep in the Lord, and was buried at Nola in the~
place called The Pines.

[Lectio94]
Hilary, born of a noble family in Aquitaine, had few equals in teaching and~
eloquence. Made bishop of Poitiers, he exercised his ministry in such a way as~
to gain the highest praise from the faithful. His vigorous campaign for the~
Catholic faith led to a four year exile in Phrygia. There he raised a dead man~
to life and performed other miracles. He wrote twelve books on the Trinity~
against the Arians, and induced all Gaul to condemn the Arian blasphemy. He wrote~
many books showing wonderful learning; St. Jerome writing to Laeta, testifies in~
these words that they can be read with out the least fear of error: one can run~
through Hilary's works without stumbling. He went to heaven on the 13th of~
January in the year 369. Pius IX, at the request of the synod of Bordeaux,~
declared and confirmed him to be a Doctor of the universal Church.
