[Ant 1]
For theirs is the Kingdom of heaven * who love not their lives in this world, and~
have attained unto the revard of the Kingdom, and have washed their robes in the~
blood of the Lamb.

[Versum 1]
V. Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye just,
R. And glory, all ye right of heart.

[Oratio]
O Lord, we pray thee to grant unto thy Church through the prayers of thine Holy~
Martyrs Vitus, Modestus, and Crescentia, to mind not high things, but in all~
lowliness to do ever such things as be pleasing in thy sight, looking down upon~
all such things as be corrupt, and working ever in love unfeigned such things as~
be righteous.

[Lectio93]
This Vitus was a child who was baptized without his father's knowledge. When his~
father had found it out, he used his best endeavours to dissuade his son from~
the Christian religion, but as he found him persistent in it, he handed him over~
to Valerian the judge to be whipped. But as he still remained as unshaken as~
before, he was given back to his father. But while his father was turning over~
in his mind to what severe discipline to subject him, Vitus, being warned by an~
Angel, fled out of the country, in company with his foster-parents Modestus and~
Crescentia. In his new home he gained great praise for holiness, so that the~
fame of it came to Diocletian, which Emperor sent for him to deliver his own~
child which was vexed with a devil. Him Vitus delivered, but when the Emperor~
found that with all his great gifts he could not bring him to worship the gods,~
he had the ingratitude to cast him and Modestus and Crescentia into prison,~
binding them in fetters. But when they were found in their prison more faithful~
than ever to their confession, the Emperor commanded them to be thrown into a~
great vessel full of melted lead, resin, and pitch. Therein these three, like~
the three Holy Children in the burning fiery furnace, sang praise to God and~
upon that they were haled forth and cast to a lion, but he lay down before them,~
and licked their feet. Then the Emperor, being filled with fury, more especially~
because he saw that the multitude that looked on were stirred up at the miracle,~
commanded Vitus, Modestus, and Crescentia to be stretched upon a block and their~
limbs crushed, and their bones rent one from the other. While as they were dying~
there came great thunderings, and lightnings, and earthquakes, so that temples~
of the gods fell down, and many men were killed. As for that which remained of~
the Martyrs, the noble lady Florence took it, and embalmed it with spices, and~
honourably buried it.

[Ant 2]
Even the very hairs of your head are all numbered * fear not therefore ye~
are of more value than many sparrows.

[Versum 2]
V. The saints shall rejoice in glory:
R. They shall be joyful in their beds.
