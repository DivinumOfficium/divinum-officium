[Oratio]
Grant, we beseech Thee, Almighty God, so to profit by the teaching and example of thy blessed~
Confessor and Bishop Peter, that, like him, we may lightly esteem the things which~
are seen and temporal, and finally attain unto those good things which are~
unseen and eternal.

[Lectio4]
The holy Doctor Peter Damian was born of respectable parents at Ravenna, (about~
the year of our Lord 988.) While he was still a suckling, his mother, overcome~
with the care of many children, cast him out to perish, but one of the women~
servants saved him when he was nigh to death, and fed him until natural~
affection appeared again in his mother, to whom she then gave him back. After~
the death of both his parents he lived with a brother who treated him like the~
lowest slave, and in whose house he underwent a hard bondage. Even while he was~
in this condition he gave a wonderful proof of his faith toward God, and his~
dutiful love toward his father. It chanced that one day he found a considerable~
sum of money, but instead of using it to relieve his own poverty, he gave it all~
to a priest to offer God's sacrifice for the forgiveness of his father's sins.~
He had happily another brother called Damian, the same from whom he seemeth~
afterwards to have taken his surname. By him he was affectionately adopted, and~
put in the way of being educated. He made such progress in learning as~
astonished his teachers, and when he had won an eminent name in letters, he~
began to teach on his own accord with general applause. Meanwhile, lest his body~
should get the better of his mind, he constantly wore a hair-shirt under his~
softer clothes, and exercised himself in fasting, watching, and prayer. In the~
spring-time of his age he was grievously tormented by the stings of the flesh;~
and sometimes, when the rebellions of lust seemed about to get the mastery over~
him at night, he threw himself into a freezing stream to check them. After this~
he would go about visiting consecrated places, and repeat the whole book of~
Psalms. He was most careful in relieving the poor, on whom he would wait with~
his own hands.

[Lectio5]
Desiring to attain to perfection of life he betook himself to the convent of~
Font-Avellano, in the diocese of Gubbio, in Umbria, a house founded by the~
blessed Ludolph, the disciple of St. Romuald, for the monks of the Holy Cross. He~
dwelt there not long before he was sent by his Abbat, first to the Abbey of~
Pomposia, and, secondly, to that of St. Vincent at Pietra Pertusa, both which~
brotherhoods he greatly profited by his godly exhortations, discreet rules, and~
grave manners. After his return home, and the death of his Superior, he was~
chosen to rule the brethren of Avellano. Here he founded diverse new hermitages,~
and made the community so to flourish under his saintly direction, that he is~
esteemed the second Father and chief ornament of that Order. This healthful care~
of Peter was made a blessing to convents of other Rules than his own, to houses~
of Canons, and to the people. He was many ways profitable to the diocese of~
Urbino. He sat with Theuzo the Bishop of that See to judge of a most weighty~
matter, and led him by his counsel and assistance rightly to administer his~
Bishopric. He was foremost in contemplation of the things of God, in severity~
toward his own body, and in other things whereby to set a bright example of~
godliness. In consideration of these things the Supreme Pontiff Stephen IX., (in~
the year 1057,) created him, in spite of his own unwillingness and objections, a~
Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church, and appointed him Bishop of Ostia. This~
dignity Peter bore with the highest reputation for piety, and adorned with works~
meet for a Bishop.

[Lectio6]
At the most anxious times he greatly sustained the Church of Rome and the~
Supreme Pontiffs by his teaching, by missions which he discharged, and by diverse~
other labours which he undertook on their behalf. He strove manfully even unto~
death against the heresies of the Nicola'itans and the Simoniacs, by putting~
down which evils he reconciled the Church of Milan to that of Rome. He was one~
of the stoutest opponents of the false Popes Benedict and Cadalous. He deterred~
Henry IV., King of Germany, from his wicked scheme for putting away his wife. He~
recalled the people of Ravenna to their bounden duty to the Bishop of Rome, and~
restored them to the communion of the Church. He reformed the Canons of Velletri,~
and brought them to lead more godly lives. There were hardly any Cathedral~
Churches, especially in the province of Urbino, of which he did not deserve~
well. In Gubbio, of which he had at one time the management, he abolished many~
things unseemly. He brought about improvements in many and diverse places, as if~
each were his special charge. (In 1062) he gave up his dignities of Cardinal and~
Bishop, but he allowed his love toward his neighbours to know no diminution. He~
was particularly zealous in spreading abroad four devout practices 1st, To~
fast every Friday in honour of the Holy Cross of Jesus Christ; 2nd, To recite~
the Hours of the Blessed Mother of God, called also her Little Office; 3rd, To~
sanctify Saturday in her honour; and 4th, and especially, to scourge oneself in~
punishment for sin committed. At length he departed to be with Christ, at Faenza,~
on his way back from his mission to Ravenna, on the 22nd of February, (in the~
year 1072,) at the height of his reputation for holiness, learning, miracles,~
and good works. His body is buried in the house of the Cistercians at Faenza,~
where the people resort often to his grave with great reverence. The citizens of~
Faenza, to whom he hath been found good at need even to this day, have chosen~
him for their Patron in the presence of God. The supreme Pontiff Leo XII.,~
finding that an Office and Mass in memory of him, as a Confessor and Bishop, was~
in use in some dioceses, and in the Camaldolese Order, by advice of the Sacred~
Congregation of Rites, added the title of Doctor, and extended the use of the~
said Office and Mass to the whole Church.

[Lectio94]
Peter, born at Ravenna, lost both his parents. Under the care of his brother~
Damian he was educated in the liberal arts and sciences. From proficiency as a~
student he advanced to renown as a teacher. In order to lead a more perfect life,~
he joined the monastery of Avellana, of the Order of the monks of the Holy Cross~
of Fonte Avellana, founded by blessed Ludolph, a disciple of St. Romuald: Later~
on, Peter governed that monastery and developed it in such a way that he was~
rightly considered another founder of his Order and its shining ornament.~
Stephen IX made him a cardinal of the Roman Church and bishop of Ostia, although~
Peter was unwilling and opposed to the appointment. At a very difficult period,~
he was a wonderful help to the Popes by his teaching and by the many missions~
and other labors he undertook. He deterred Henry IV, king of Germany, from the~
evil deed of divorcing his wife. He finally died in the Lord, famous for his~
holy works, at Faenza, as he was returning from a mission at Ravenna.
