[Lectio93]
Hilarion was born of heathens at Tabatha in Palestine, (about the year of our~
Lord 291.) He was sent to study at Alexandria, where he bore a fair name for~
life and wit. There he embraced the religion of Jesus Christ, and made wonderful~
head-way in faith and love. He went oftentimes to Church, was careful in fasting~
and prayer, and set no price upon the pleasures and lusts of the world. When the~
name of Antony became famous in Egypt, Hilarion made a journey into the desert~
on purpose to see him. There he dwelt with him two months, to the end that he~
might learn all his way of life, and then returned home. After the death of his~
father and mother, he gave all that he had to the poor. Before he had completed~
the fifteenth year of his age, he went into the desert, and built there a little~
house, scarcely big enough to hold him, and wherein he was used to sleep on the~
ground. The piece of sackcloth wherewith alone he clad himself he never washed~
and never changed, saying that hair-cloth was a thing not worth the trouble of~
cleanliness. He took great interest in reading and meditating on the Holy~
Scriptures. His food was a few figs and some porridge of vegetables, and this he~
ate not before set of sun. His self-control and lowliness were beyond belief. By~
these and other arms he overcame diverse and fearful attacks of the devil, and~
drave out countless evil spirits from the bodies of men in many parts of the~
world. He had built many monasteries, and was famous for miracles, when, in the~
eightieth year of his age, he fell sick. When he was gasping for his last breath,~
he said Go out what art thou afraid of? Go out, my soul! wherefore shrinkest~
thou? Thou hast served Christ hard on seventy years and art thou afraid of~
death? And so with these words he gave up the Ghost.
