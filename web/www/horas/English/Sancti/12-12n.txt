[Versum 1]
V. He hath not done in like manner to every nation.
R. And his judgments he hath not made manifest to them.

[Ant 1]
I have chosen and made holy this place * That my name may be there, and mine eyes, and my heart may remain there for all the days.

[Ant 3]
Lift up thine eyes * round about, and see: all they gather themselves together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall rise up at thy side.

[Oratio]
O God, who hast placed us under the special patronage of the most Blessed Virgin Mary, and hast been pleased to shower perpetual blessings upon us: grant to Thy suppliants; that, as we are brought joy on earth by the commemoration today, we may enjoy her sight in heaven.
$Per Dominum

[Lectio94]
In Mexico, on the hill of Tepeyac, in the year 1531, the God-bearing Virgin Mary, as is piously handed down, appeared to the neophyte Juan Diego, and gave him a command for Bishop Juan de Zumarraga, which she urgently repeated, that a church was to be constructed in her name at that location. The bishop, however, requested a sign. Then, while he was seeking the sacraments for his dying uncle far from the place of the apparition, his loving Mother favored the neophyte with a third vision, assured him of his uncle's health, and after he had gathered roses into his cloak that had blossomed out of season, she ordered him to take them to the bishop. The roses having spilled out in the sight of the bishop, an image of Mary, impressed upon the cloak itself, according to the tradition, appeared to those present in a wondrous manner. At first kept in the bishop's chapel, then transferred to a shrine constructed on the hill of Tepeyac, it was finally moved to a magnificent temple, to which Mexicans increasingly began to gather in droves, for reasons of veneration and frequency of miracles. And therefore as an ever-present defense, the Mexican bishops, to the applause of the whole people, chose the Blessed Virgin Mary of Guadalupe as the first Patroness of the Mexican people, which was duly confirmed by the apostolic authority of Benedict XIV. Leo XIII adorned the sacred image with a golden crown on Columbus Day, 1895, by the agency of the archbishop of Mexico. And St. Pius X declared the blessed Guadalupan Virgin as the Patroness of all Latin America.

[Hymnus Laudes]
!From St. Anselm, Bishop of Canterbury
v. Kindly Mother like no other
Free from all corrupting stain,
Thou he preferred who death deterred
Breaking all its bonds in twain.
_
Mercifully give us fully
To rejoice in true light's light,
We who cling to thy feasts bring to
Them joy that is meet and right.
_
May we receive grace to believe,
Pray too that faith's power soar,
And that fragile minds be agile,
Strengthen hope and love still more.
_
Themes of dirges, war and scourges,
Hunger, plagues and massacres,
Far be removed that thou be proved
Dawn of hope for sufferers.
_
Consolation 'gainst frustration
May sad hearts and fetters feel,
Answer the prayers, also the cares
That all sense thy pow'r to heal.
_
Friendly be foe while here below,
Evil-do'rs likewise subdue,
Bringing peaceful indeed gleeful
Times to gladden hearts anew.
_
By thy passion and compassion
Grant us help in all our needs
That forever reigning, never
Cease our lauds for thy Son's deeds.
_
Father true God and Son true God,
God the Holy Spirit too,
Trinity God, Unity God,
Rule forever, as is due. Amen.

[Versum 2]
V. Let all the earth worship thee, and sing unto thee.
R. Let them sing praises to thy Name, O Lord.

[Ant 2]
As the rainbow * giving light in the bright clouds of glory, and as the flower of roses in the spring of the year.
