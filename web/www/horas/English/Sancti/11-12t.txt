[Lectio4]
Martin was born at Todi in Tuscany. At the beginning of his Popedom, (in the~
year 649,) he was careful to send an embassage with letters to Paul, Patriarch~
of Constantinople, to call upon him to return to the truth of the Catholic faith~
from the blasphemous heresy (of the Monothelites.) But Paul, being backed up by~
the heretic Emperor Constans, had become so rabid, that he sent away the~
messengers of the Apostolic See into diverse places in the islands. This crime~
moved the Pope to gather together at Rome a council of one - hundred - and five~
Bishops, by whom Paul was condemned.

[Lectio5]
Thereupon Constans sent Olympius into Italy as Exarch, straitly commanding him~
either to slay Pope Martin, or else to bring him into his Imperial presence.~
Olympius therefore came to Rome and bade a lictor to kill the Pope while as he~
was celebrating the Liturgy solemnly in the Cathedral Church of St~
Mary-at-the-Manger. But when the lictor went thither, he was struck with~
blindness.

[Lectio6]
From that time forth many evils befell the Emperor Constans; but he repented~
not. He sent the Exarch Theodore Calliopas to Rome, with command to lay hands on~
the Pope. By him Martin was treacherously taken (on the 17th day of June, 653,)~
and (forthwith carried to the island of Naxos. On the 17th of September in 654~
he was) brought to Constantinople, (where he was kept in prison) till he was~
sent to the Crimea (on the 15th of May, 655.) There his sufferings for the~
Catholic faith utterly broke him down, and he left this life for a better, upon~
the 12th day of November, (in the same year 655.) He was famous for miracles.~
His body was afterwards brought back to Rome and buried in the Church dedicated~
under the names of St. Silvester and St. Martin (of Tours.) He ruled the Church~
for six years, one month, and twenty-six days. He held two ordinations in the~
month of December, wherein he made eleven Priests, five Deacons, and thirtythree~
Bishops for diverse places.

From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 16:13-19
At that time: Jesus came into the coasts of Cassarea Philippi, and He asked His~
disciples, saying: Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am? And so on.
_
Homily by Pope St. Leo (the Great)
!2nd on the anniversary of his own election.
When the Lord, as we read in the Evangelist, asked His disciples: Who did men,~
amid their diverse speculations, believe that He, the Son of Man, was; blessed~
Peter answered and said: Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. And~
Jesus answered and said unto him: Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh~
and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but My Father, Which is in: and I say~
also unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My Church,~
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it; and I will give unto thee~
the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall~
be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in~
heaven. Thus therefore standeth the ordinance of the Truth, and blessed Peter,~
abiding still that firm rock which God hath made him, hath never lost that right~
to rule in the Church which God hath given unto him.

[Lectio8]
In the universal Church it is Peter that doth still say every day,~
Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God, and every tongue which~
confesseth that Jesus is Lord is taught that confession by the teaching of~
Peter. This is the faith that overcometh the devil and looseth the bands of his~
prisoners. This is the faith which maketh men free of the world and bringeth~
them to heaven, and the gates of hell are impotent to prevail against it. With~
such ramparts of salvation hath God fortified this rock, that the contagion of~
heresy will never be able to infect it, nor idolatry and unbelief to overcome~
it. This teaching it is, my dearly beloved brethren, which maketh the keeping of~
this Feast to-day to be our reasonable service, even the teaching which maketh~
you to know and honour in myself, lowly though I be, that Peter who is still~
entrusted with the care of all other shepherds and of all the flocks to them~
committed, and whose authority I have, albeit unworthy to be his heir.

[Lectio9]
When therefore, we address our exhortations to your godly ears,
1 believe ye that ye are hearing him speak whose office we are discharging. Yea,~
it is with his love for you that we warn you, and we preach unto you no other~
thing than that which he taught, entreating you that ye would gird up the loins~
of your mind and lead pure and sober lives in the fear of God. 2 My disciples~
dearly beloved, ye are to me, as the disciples of the Apostle Paul were to him,~
~(Phil. iv. 1,) a crown and a joy, if your faith, which, in the first times of~
the Gospel, was spoken of throughout the whole world, (Rom. i. 8,) abide still~
lovely and holy. For, albeit it behoveth the whole Church which is spread~
throughout all the world, to be strong in righteousness, you it chiefly becometh~
above all other peoples to excel in worth and godliness, whose house is built~
upon the very crown of the Rock of the Apostle, and whom not only hath our Lord~
Jesus Christ, as He hath redeemed all men, but whom also His blessed Apostle~
Peter hath made the foremost object of his teaching.
