[Oratio]
O Lord our God, Who, through thine Only-begotten Son, didst cause thy blessed~
hand-maid Bridget to see certain things which are naturally known not on earth~
but in heaven, grant unto us thy servants at her motherly prayers, to be one day~
blessed for ever in the vision of thine eternal glory.

[Lectio4]
Bridget was the daughter of princely and godly parents, and was born in Sweden,~
~(in the year of our Lord 1304.) Her life was a very holy one. When she was still~
in the womb, her mother was for her sake saved from shipwreck. When she was ten~
years old, she heard a sermon upon the sufferings of the Lord, and the following~
night she saw Jesus on the Cross, covered with fresh Blood, and heard Him~
speaking to her of His same sufferings. From that time forth the thought of them~
touched her so keenly, that she could never again call them to mind without~
weeping.

[Lectio5]
When she was sixteen years of age she was given in marriage to Ulpho, Prince of~
Nericia. She moved her husband to godly works, as well by her noble example as~
by her earnest words. She expended the most motherly care upon the up-bringing~
of her children. She opened an hospital, in which she carefully tended the poor,~
especially the sick, and would wash and kiss their feet. She made a pilgrimage~
with her husband to Compostella, to visit the grave of the holy Apostle James.~
On their way back Ulpho fell grievously sick at Arras, and St. Denys appeared in~
the night to Bridget, to tell her as well that her husband would be healed, as~
diverse other things to come.

[Lectio6]
~(In the year 1344) her husband died, after having become a Cistercian monk.~
Bridget, having heard the voice of Christ in a dream, took upon herself an~
harder way of life. During her life God made known to her many hidden things.~
She founded the monastery of Wastein, under the Rule of the Holy Saviour, a Rule~
which she had received from the Lord Himself. By the command of God she went to~
Rome, where she stirred up many by her example to seek the love of God. Thence~
she went to Jerusalem, and then returned again to Rome. From this pilgrimage she~
caught a fever, of which she lay sick an whole year in sharp sufferings, and~
then, laden with good works, and after foretelling the day of her own death, she~
departed from earth to heaven, (upon the 23rd day of July, in the year 1373.)~
Her body was taken to the monastery of Wastein. She was famous for miracles, and~
Boniface IX enrolled her name among those of the Saints.

[Lectio94]
Born in Sweden of noble and devout parents, Bridget lived a very holy life. She was so affected by meditating on the Passion of the Lord that she could not think thereon without tears. She was given in marriage to Ulpho, Prince of Nericia, and urged him to godly works, as well by her noble example as by her earnest words. She educated her children most devoutly and served the poor and the sick. Her husband became a Cistercian monk and died soon after, and Bridget thereupon adopted a more austere way of life. Many secret things were then divinely revealed to her. She founded the monastery of Vadstena under the Rule of the Holy Saviour, and went to Jerusalem on a pilgrimage. Finally at Rome, when she had suffered for a whole year from a grave illness, she went to heaven. Renowned for miracles, she was enrolled among the Saints by Boniface IX.
