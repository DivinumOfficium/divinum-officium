O Lord Jesus Christ, model of true humility and its reward, we beseech Thee, that~
as Thou made blessed Francis one of Thy glorious imitators by his contempt for~
earthly honors, grant us to follow his example and to share in his glory.
$Qui vivis

[Lectio4]
Francis, fourth Duke of Gandia, was the son of John Borgia, Duke of Gandia, and~
of Joan of Aragon, daughter of Alphonso, natural son to Ferdinand V. surnamed~
the Catholic, King of Aragon. (He was born at Gandia, in the kingdom of Valencia,~
in the year of our Lord 1510.) He passed his boyhood at home in great innocence~
and godliness, and was still more remarkable for his Christian graces and the~
hardness of his living, at the Court of the Emperor Charles V., and as Vice-Roy of Catalonia. (On May the 1st, 1539) died the Empress~
Isabella, and Francis, (as her master of the horse,) was commanded to attend her~
body to Granada, where it was to be buried. (At Granada the coffin was opened,~
in order that he might swear to the magistrates of the city that it was indeed~
the body of the late Empress,) and the sight of the awful change which death had~
made in her countenance so thrilled him with the thought of our mortality and~
corruption, that he bound himself by vow, as soon as he lawfully might, to give~
up all things, and to serve the King of kings only. From that time he so~
advanced in Christian graces, that his life might be called the miracle of~
princes, showing, in the midst of a vast mass of business, an image of~
perfection attained in a cloister. greatly endeared him to Princes and Popes,~
and besides founding or enlarging very many houses in diverse places, he sent~
brethren into the kingdom of Poland, into the islands of the Ocean, and into the~
provinces of Mexico and Peru, and into other lands also Apostolic men who spread~
the Roman Catholic faith by their preaching, their sweat, and their blood.

[Lectio5]
His wife, Eleanora de Castro, died (on the 27th of March, 1546,)~
and (in 1551) he entered the Society of Jesus, that therein he might hide~
himself more safely, and bar by the obligation of a vow the path to dignities.~
He was the worthy leader of many princes who have embraced a life of hardship,~
and Charles V. himself when he resigned the Empire did not deny that he had been~
moved and shown the way by Francis. In his struggle after austerity Francis, by~
fasting, by iron chains, by the roughest of hair -cloth, by long and bloody~
flagellations, and by denying himself any but very little sleep, reduced his~
body to the last degree, but would still spare no toil to overcome himself and~
to save souls. Thus full of ghostly strength, he was appointed by holy Ignatius,~
~(in the year 1554,) Commissary-General of the Society in Spain, Portugal, and~
the Indies, and (on the 2nd of July, 1565,) notwithstanding all the precautions~
he could take to prevent it, he was chosen by the general Congregation of the~
Society to be General, being the third who held that office. In this position~
his wisdom and holiness of life

[Lectio6]
He thought so little of himself that he gave himself the nickname of Francis~
the sinner. By the Popes he was oftentimes offered the dignity of Cardinal of~
the Roman Church, but the lowly firmness with which he refused it could never be~
overcome. In his cheap esteem of the world and of himself his chief pleasures~
were to clean the house, to beg for food from door to door, and to wait upon the~
sick in hospitals. He spent many hours every day, oftentimes eight and sometimes~
ten, in prayer and meditation. An hundred times every day he worshipped God upon~
his knees. He never missed the opportunity of offering the Holy Liturgy, and the~
fire from God which burnt within him sometimes shone forth in his countenance~
when he was lifting the Sacred Host, or preaching. By an inward power given him~
from God he could tell where the most Holy Body of Christ, under the Eucharistic~
veils, was kept. (In 1570, the year before the victory of Lepanto,) the blessed~
Pius V. sent Francis with the Cardinal Alexandrini on an embassy (into France,~
Spain, and Portugal,) to unite the Christian Princes against Turkey. His vital~
strength was then nearly worn out, but, through obedience, he undertook the toil~
of the journey. He became much worse during the travelling, and on his return~
brought to a blessed end at Rome, as had been his desire, the pilgrimage of this~
life, (a little before midnight between the last day of September and the first~
of October,) in the sixty-second year of his own life, and that of salvation~
1572. Holy Teresa, who used his advice, called him an holy man, and Gregory~
XIII., a faithful servant. He was famous for many and great signs and wonders,~
and Clement X. at last numbered him among the Saints.

[Lectio94]
Francis, fourth duke of Gandia, was first famed for the holiness of his life at the court of Emperor Charles V. But when he was sent to Granada to the Burial of Queen Isabella, and read in her face, changed by decay, the fate of all things mortal, he bound himself by vow to leave everything and serve only the King of heaven. Accordingly, after the death of his wife, Eleanor of Castile, he entered the Society of Jesus. St. Ignatius made him Commissary General in Spain and a little later he was chosen, although against his will, to be the third general of whole Society. St. Pius V appointed him as an aid to his legate, Cardinal Alessandrino, in a mission to unite the Christian princes against the Turks. Out of obedience he undertook the difficult journey; but it was at Rome, as he had wished, that he had happily completed the course of his life in the year of Salvation 1572. Clement X numbered him among the Saints.
