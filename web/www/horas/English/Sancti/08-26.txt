[Lectio93]
Pope Zephyrinus was a Roman, who was called to govern the Church, (in the year 202,) during the reign of the Emperor Severus. It was he who decreed that they who are to be ordained should be ordained only at a fit time, and in the presence of many clerks and laymen, as was indeed already the custom, and that none but learned men and well known and spoken of should be set apart to that office. He decreed also that when the Bishop celebrated the Holy Liturgy, all the Priests should be present around him. Also he decreed that no Patriarch, Primate, or Metropolitan should pronounce sentence on a Bishop, unless they were charged with the authority of the Apostolic See. He lived as Pope eighteen years. He held four December ordinations, wherein he made thirteen Priests, seven Deacons, and thirteen Bishops for diverse places. He received the crown of his testimony under the Emperor Antonine, and was buried on the Appian Way, near the cemetery of Callistus, upon the 26th day of August, (in the year 219.)
