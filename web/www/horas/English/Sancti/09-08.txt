From the Sermons of St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!18 th on the Saints.
Dearly beloved brethren, the day for which we have longed, the Feast-day of the~
Blessed and Worshipful and Alway- Virgin Mary, that day is come. Let our land~
laugh and sing with merriment, bathed in the glory of this great Virgin's~
rising. She is the flower of the fields on which the priceless lily of the~
valleys hath blossomed. This is she whose delivery changed the nature that we~
draw from our first parents, and cleansed away their offence. At her that~
dolorous sentence which was pronounced over Eve ended its course to her it was~
never said "In sorrow thou shalt bring forth children." (Gen. iii. 16.) She~
brought forth a Child, even the Lord, but she brought Him forth, not in sorrow,~
but in joy.

Eve wept, but Mary laughed. Eve's womb was big with tears, but Mary's womb was~
big with gladness. Eve gave birth to a sinner, but Mary gave birth to the~
sinless One. The mother of our race brought punishment into the world, but the~
Mother of our Lord brought salvation into the world. Eve was the foundress of~
sin, but Mary was the foundress of righteousness. Eve welcomed death, but Mary~
helped in life. Eve smote, but Mary healed. For Eve's disobedience, Mary offered~
obedience and for Eve's unbelief, Mary offered faith.

[Responsory5]
R. Let us keep with rejoicing the Birthday of the Blessed Mary,
* That she may pray for us to our Lord Jesus Christ.
V. With all our heart and with all our soul let us sing praise to Christ on this~
the solemn Feastday of Mary the mighty Mother of God.
R. That she may pray for us to our Lord Jesus Christ.

[Lectio6]
Let Mary now make a loud noise upon the organ, and between its quick notes let~
the rattling of the Mother's timbrel be heard. Let the gladsome choirs sing with~
her, and their sweet hymns mingle with the changing music. Hearken to what a~
song her timbrel will make accompaniment. She saith " My soul doth magnify the~
Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. For He hath regarded the~
lowliness of His hand-maiden, for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall~
call me blessed for He That is Mighty hath done to me great things." The new~
miracle of Mary's delivery hath effaced the curse of the frail backslider, and~
the singing of Mary hath silenced the wailing of Eve.

[Responsory6]
R. thy Birth, O Virgin Mother of God, was a message of joy to the whole world
* For out of thee rose the Sun of righteousness, even Christ our God, Who hath~
taken away the curse and brought a blessing, confounded death, and given unto us~
everlasting life.
V. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the Fruit of thy womb.
R. For out of thee rose the Sun of righteousness, even Christ our God.

R. Who hath taken away the curse and brought a blessing, confounded death, and~
given unto us everlasting life.

From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 1:1-17
The Book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the son of~
Abraham. Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob. And so on.
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Bk. i. Comm. on Matth.
In Isaiah (liii. 8) we read: "Who shall declare His generation?" Let us not~
think that there is any contradiction between the Prophet and the Evangelist,~
because the Prophet saith that this thing cannot be done, and the Evangelist~
beginneth by doing it. The one speaketh of the generation of the Divine (Word by~
the Eternal Father,) the other of the (family in which the) Incarnation (took~
place.) Matthew beginneth with carnal things, that by learning of men we may go~
on to learn of God. " The Son of David, the son of Abraham." The reversal of the~
order in these clauses is a needful change. If Abraham had been put first and~
David afterwards, Abraham would have had to be taken again, in order to marshal~
the pedigree properly.

[Responsory7]
R. O Holy Virgin Mary, happy indeed art thou, and right worthy of all praise
* For out of thee rose the Sun of righteousness, even Christ our God.
V. Pray for the people, plead for the clergy, make intercession for all women~
vowed to God. May all that are keeping this thine holy Birth-day feel the might~
of thine assistance.
R. For out of thee rose the Sun of righteousness, even Christ our God.

[Lectio8]
Matthew first calleth Christ the Son of these twain Abraham and David without~
making mention of the others, because unto these twain only was promise of~
Christ made unto Abraham, where it is said "In thy seed " (that is, in~
Christ) "shall all the nations of the earth be blessed," (Gen. xxii. 18) and~
unto David, in the words " Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy~
throne." (Ps. cxxxi. 11.) "And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar." It is to~
be remarked that in the genealogy of the Saviour none of the holy women are~
named, but those women only are named against whom the Scripture hath to say~
something amiss. He Who came to save sinners was born of sinners, that He might~
wash away all sin. Afterwards are named Ruth, who was a Moabitess, and Bathsheba,~
who had been the wife of Uriah.

!Commemoratio for the holy Martyr Adrian.
Adrian was a man who was employed by the Emperor Maximian to persecute the~
Christians of Nicomedia. The firmness with which they owned their faith and~
endured their torments oftentimes excited his wonder, and at last so powerfully~
moved him that he himself turned to Christ. For this he was thrown into prison~
along with three - and twenty other Christians. There he Rahab might be added, v.~
5. was visited by Natalia his wife, who also herself already had believed in~
Christ, and by her urged on to lift up his testimony. When he was brought out of~
prison he was lashed until his bowels fell out. His shins were then broken, and~
his hands and feet cut off, whereafter, in company with many others, he brought~
to an happy end the conflict of martyrdom.
