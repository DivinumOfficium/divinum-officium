[Versum 1]
V. Lord, Thou didst mark thy servant Francis. 
R. With the marks of our Redemption. 

[Hymnus Vespera]
v. This the confessor of the Lord, whose triumph
Now all the faithful celebrate, with gladness
Erst on this feast-day merited 
Christ's wounds
_
Saintly and prudent, modest in behaviour,
Peaceful and sober, chaste was he, and lowly.
While that life's vigour, coursing through his members,
Quickened his being.
_
Sick ones of old time, to his tomb resorting,
Sorely by ailments manifold afflicted,
Oft-times have welcomed health and strength returning,
At his petition.
_
Whence we in chorus gladly do him honour,
Chanting his praises with devout affection,
That in his merits we may have a portion,
Now and forever.
_
His be the glory, power and salvation,
Who over all things reigneth in the highest,
Earth's mighty fabric ruling and directing,
Onely and Trinal.
Amen.

[Oratio]
O Lord Jesus Christ, Who, when the love of many was waxing cold, didst manifest~
once more the holy marks of thine own Suffering in the flesh of thy most blessed~
servant Francis, to the end that our hearts might kindle again with the fire of~
the love of thyself, be Thou entreated for thy servant's sake, and grant to his~
and our prayers that we may effectually carry thy Cross and bring forth fruits~
meet for repentance.

[Lectio1]
From the letter of St. Paul to the Galatians.
!Gal 5:25-26; 6:1-6
25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
26 Let us not be made desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying on~
another.
1 Brethren, and if a man be overtaken in any fault, you, who are spiritual,~
instruct such a one in the spirit of meekness, considering thyself, lest thou~
also be tempted.
2 Bear ye one another's burdens; and so you shall fulfil the law of Christ.
3 For if any man think himself to be some thing, whereas he is nothing, he~
deceiveth himself.
4 But let every one prove his own work, and so he shall have glory in himself~
only, and not in another.
5 For every one shall bear his own burden.
6 And let him that is instructed in the word, communicate to him that~
instructeth him, in all good things.

[Lectio2]
Gal 6:7-13
7 Be not deceived, God is not mocked.
8 For what things a man shall sow, those also shall he reap. For he that soweth~
in his flesh, of the flesh also shall reap corruption. But he that soweth in the~
spirit, of the spirit shall reap life everlasting.
9 And in doing good, let us not fail. For in due time we shall reap, not~
failing.
10 Therefore, whilst we have time, let us work good to all men, but especially~
to those who are of the household of the faith.
11 See what a letter I have written to you with my own hand.
12 For as many as desire to please in the flesh, they constrain you to be~
circumcised, only that they may not suffer the persecution of the cross of~
Christ.
13 For neither they themselves who are circumcised, keep the law; but they will~
have you to be circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.

[Lectio3]
Gal 6:14-18
14 But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus~
Christ; by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.
15 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor~
uncircumcision, but a new creature.
16 And whosoever shall follow this rule, peace on them, and mercy, and upon the~
Israel of God.
17 From henceforth let no man be troublesome to me; for I bear the marks of the~
Lord Jesus in my body.
18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.

[Lectio4]
From the Readings upon the Life of St. Francis, composed by St. Buona- Ventura,~
Cardinal Bishop (of Albano.)
!Chapter 13
Francis being indeed a faithful servant and minister of Christ, about the space~
of two years before he gave back his spirit to heaven, withdrew himself into an~
high mountain apart, even that mountain which is called Mount Alverno, and began~
to fast for forty days to the honour of the Archangel Michael. To think of the~
things above gave him sweeter comfort than beforetime he was wont, and the hot~
longing for heaven was kindled in him, so that he began to feel that the gifts~
from above were poured forth upon him in such fulness as he had never felt~
before. The burning of his desire made his heart rise towards God like the heart~
of a seraph, and his tender answering love yearned to be changed into the~
likeness of Him Who hath so loved us that He was content to bear the Cross. And~
it was so that one morning early, about the time of the Feast of the Exaltation~
of the Holy Cross, he was praying upon the side of the mountain, and there~
appeared unto him as it had been one of the Seraphim, having six wings, glorious~
and fiery, flying to him from heaven. It came therefore very swiftly, and stood~
in the air, hard by the man of God. He beheld then the appearance thereof that~
it was not winged only, but crucified also. His hands and feet were stretched~
forth and nailed to a Cross. Twain of his wings were lifted up and joined one to~
the other over his head, and twain were stretched forth to fly withal, and with~
twain he wrapped around his body. When Francis saw it, he was sore amazed, and~
his soul was.filled with sorrow and gladness, for the eyes of him that appeared~
were full of strange love and tenderness, so that he conceived great rejoicing~
thereat, but the nailing to the Cross was so exceedingly dreadful, that as he~
saw it, a sword of sorrow pierced his soul.

[Lectio5]
Then He Whom he beheld with his bodily eyes, began to speak silently unto him in~
his heart, and he understood that albeit the deathless Seraphim cannot suffer or~
faint, this vision was nevertheless therefore set before him, that he might know~
that as a friend of Christ he was to be all changed into the likeness of Christ~
Jesus crucified, not by the martyrdom of the body, but by the fervour of the~
soul. Then they held together some sweet converse, as of a man with his friend,~
and the vision passed from him, but his heart was kindled inwardly with the fire~
of the Seraphim, and his body was outwardly changed into the likeness of Him Who~
was crucified, even as wax is softened by the fire and taketh the impression of~
the seal. From thenceforth there were in his hands and feet the marks of the~
nails. The heads of the nails were seen in the palms of his hands and on the~
insteps of his feet, and the points came out on the backs of his hands and the~
soles of his feet. In his right side also was a long raw wound, as though he had~
been pierced with a spear, from which wound his holy blood oftentimes ran and~
stained his shirt and breeches.

[Lectio6]
Thereafter Francis was a new creature, famous for a new and awful sign. The holy~
marks of the Lord Jesus, whereon living man for twelve centuries had not been~
allowed to look, were his adornment. He came down from the mount bearing in~
himself the form of Jesus Crucified, not portrayed upon tables of stone or wood~
by the hand of any earthly craftsman, but drawn upon his flesh by the finger of~
the living God. The dying Seraph knew well that it is good to keep close the~
secret of a king, (Tobit xii. 7,) and knowing the secret of his King, he strove~
as far as in him lay to keep the sacred marks hidden from men. Nevertheless,~
forasmuch as it is the will of the Lord God for His Own glory to make manifest~
the greatness of His Own works, He openly showed forth diverse wonders through~
these wounds which He had Himself made in secret, so that the hidden and~
wondrous power of the marks might become known by the fame of the miracles. The~
foregoing marvellous but thoroughly witnessed facts, which were already spoken~
of in Papal documents with especial praise and joy, were made, by the pleasure~
of Pope Benedict XI, the subject of a yearly memorial, which was afterwards~
extended by Paul V. to the whole Church, in the hope of fanning in the hearts of~
the faithful the love of Christ Crucified.

[Responsory8]
R. But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ;
* By whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.
V. For I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus in my body.
R. By whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.
&Gloria
R. By whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.

[Lectio94]
Francis, by a singular privilege, was adorned with the holy marks of the Lord Jesus, whereon living man for twelve centuries had not been allowed to look. He came down from the mount bearing in himself the form of Jesus Crucified, not pourtrayed upon tables of stone or wood by the hand of any earthly craftsman, but drawn upon his flesh by the finger of the living God. The dying Seraph knew well that it is good to keep close the secret of a king, and knowing the secret of his King, he strove as far as in him lay to keep the sacred marks hidden from men. Nevertheless, forasmuch as it is the will of the Lord God for his own glory to make manifest the greatness of his own works, he openly shewed forth diverse wonders through these wounds which he had himself made in secret, so that the hidden and wondrous power of the marks might become known by the fame of the miracles. - The foregoing marvellous but thoroughly witnessed facts, which were already spoken of in Papal documents with especial praise and joy, were made, by the pleasure of Pope Benedict XI, the subject of a yearly memorial, which was afterwards extended by Paul V to the whole Church, in the hope of fanning in the hearts of the faithful the love of Christ Crucified.
&teDeum

[Hymnus Laudes]
v. Jesu, eternal truth sublime,
Through endless years the same!
Thou crown of those who through all time
Confess thy holy name:
_
thy suppliant people, through the prayer
Of thy blest saint, forgive;
For his dear sake, thy wrath forbear,
And bid our spirits live.
_
Again returns the sacred day,
With heavenly glory bright,
Which saw him from Christ's body
Receive holy marks.
_
All objects of our vain desire,
All earthly joys and gains,
To him were but as filthy mire;
And now with thee he reigns.
_
thee, Jesu, his all-gracious Lord,
Confessing to the last,
He trod beneath him Satan's fraud,
And stood forever fast.
_
In holy deeds of faith and love,
In fastings and in prayers,
His days were spent; and now above
thy heavenly feast he shares.
_
Then, for his sake thy wrath lay by,
And hear us while we pray;
And pardon us, O thou most high,
On this his festal day.
_
* All glory to the Father be;
And sole Incarnate Son;
Praise, holy Paraclete, to thee;
While endless ages run.
Amen.
