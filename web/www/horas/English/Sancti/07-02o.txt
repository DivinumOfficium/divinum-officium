Lesson from the book of Canticles
!Song 2:1-7
1 I am the flower of the field, and the lily of the valleys.
2 As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.
3 As the apple tree among the trees of the woods, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow, whom I desired: and his fruit was sweet to my palate.
4 He brought me into the cellar of wine, he set in order charity in me.
5 Stay me up with flowers, compass me about with apples: because I languish with love.
6 His left hand is under my head, and his right hand shall embrace me.
7 I adjure you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and the harts of the, fields, that you stir not up, nor make the beloved to awake, till she please

[Responsory1]
R. Rise up, make haste, my love my fair one and come away For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.
* The voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land.
V. Mary entered into the house of Zacharias and saluted Elizabeth.
R. The voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land.

[Lectio2]
!Song 2:8-13
8 The voice of my beloved, behold he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping over the hills.
9 My beloved is like a roe, or a young hart. Behold he standeth behind our wall, looking through the windows, looking through the lattices.
10 Behold my beloved speaketh to me: Arise, make haste, my love, my dove, my beautiful one, and come.
11 For winter is now past, the rain is over and gone.
12 The flowers have appeared in our land, the time of pruning is come: the voice of the turtle is heard in our land:
13 The fig tree hath put forth her green figs: the vines in flower yield their sweet smell.

[Responsory2]
R. Who is this that cometh up like the sun This, comely as Jerusalem
* The daughters of Zion saw her, and called her blessed the queens also, and they praised her.

R. The daughters of Zion saw her, and called her blessed the queens also, and they praised her.

[Lectio3]
!Song 2:13-17
13 Arise, my love, my beautiful one, and come:
14 My dove in the clefts of the rock, in the hollow places of the wall, show me thy face, let thy voice sound in my ears: for thy voice is sweet, and thy face comely.
15 Catch us the little foxes that destroy the vines: for our vineyard hath flourished.
16 My beloved to me, and I to him who feedeth among the lilies,
17 Till the day break, and the shadows retire. Return: be like, my beloved, to a roe, or to a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.

Sermo venerabilis Bedæ presbyteri
Accepto virginis consensu, mox angelus cælesria repetit, illa petit montana, festinat inuisere Elisabeth, non quasi incredulo de oraculo, uel dubio de exemplo, sed ut læta de uoto, religiosa pro officio, typicum pariter exemplum tribuens, quod omnis anima, quæ uerbum dei mente conceperit, uirtutum statim celsa cacumina gressu conscendat amoris, quatenus ciuitatem Iuda, id est confessionis, et laudis arcem penetrare, et usque ad perfectionem fidei, spei, et charitatis, quasi tribus in ea mensibus ualeat commorari.

[Responsory4]
R. Behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills
* My beloved is like a gazelle or a young roe-buck!
V. He rejoiceth as a giant to run his course, his going-forth is from the end of the heavens.
R. My beloved is like a gazelle or a young roe-buck!

[Lectio5]
Disce uirgo humilitatem Mariæ, ut et corpore casta, et pectore possis esse deuota. Visitat iunior seniorem, salutat uirgo uxorem. Decet enim, ut quo castior uirgo, eo sit humilior, et senioribus deferens, habitum castitatis præconio commendet humilitatis. Maria ad Elisabeth, dominus uenit ad Ioannem, hæc ut spiritu sancto repleatur, illius ut baptisma consacretur: maiorumque humiliatio minorum est utiquue exaltatio.

[Responsory5]
R. Rejoice with me, rejoice with me, all ye that love the Lord, for, while I was yet a little one, I pleased the Most High,
* And I have brought forth from my bowels God and man.
V. All generations shall call me blessed, for God hath regarded the low estate of His hand-maiden.
R. And I have brought forth from my bowels God and man.

[Lectio6]
Vocem prior Elisabeth audiuit, sed Ioannes prior gratiam sensit. Illa naturæ ordine audiuit, iste exaltauit ratione mysterii. Illa Mariæ, ista domini sensit aduentum. Istæ gratiam loquuntur, illi intus operantur, pietatisque mysterium maternis adoriuntur profectibus, duplicique miraculo prophetant matres spiritu paruulorum. Exultauit infans, et repleta mater esr; non prius mater repleta quam filius, sed cum filius esset repletus spiritu sancto, repleuit et matrem.

[Responsory6]
R. Blessed art thou that hast believed, for there shall be a performance of those things which were told thee from the Lord. And Mary said
* My soul doth magnify the Lord.
V. Come, hear, and I will declare what God hath done for my soul.
R. My soul doth magnify the Lord.
&Gloria
R. My soul doth magnify the Lord.

From the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 1:39-47
And Mary arose in those days and went into the hill-country with haste, into a city of Judah. And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elizabeth. And so on.

Sermon of St. John Chrysostom, Patriarch of Constantinople.
!In Metaphrast. July.
As soon as our Redeemer was come among us, He went with haste, while as yet He was in His mother's womb, to visit His friend John. And John, in the one womb, becoming conscious of the Presence of Jesus in the other womb, dashed himself impatiently against the narrow walls of his natural prison, as though crying out I see the very Lord who hath given nature her bounds, and I wait not for the due season of my birth. There is no need for me to linger here till nine months are ended, for He That is Eternal is with me I will break out of my dark cell I will proclaim my full knowledge of many wonders. I am the sign. I will show that the Christ is here. I am the trumpet let me peal forth the news that the Son of God is come in the flesh. Let me give my trumpetnote, let me bless my father's tongue, and make it to speak again. Let me give my trumpet-note, let me quicken my mother's womb.

[Responsory7]
R. All generations shall call me blessed,
* For the Lord, That is mighty, hath done to me great things, and holy is His Name.
V. And His mercy is on them that fear Him, from generation to generation.
R. For the Lord, That is mighty, hath done to me great things, and holy is His Name.

[Lectio8]
Thou seest, O beloved, how new and how strange a mystery is here John is not born, but by leaping he speaketh he is yet unseen, and he giveth warning he is not yet able to cry, but by his acts he is heard he draweth not yet the breath of life, but he preacheth God he seeth not yet the light, but he maketh known the Sun he is not come out of the womb, but he hasteth to play the Fore-runner in the Presence of the Lord he cannot restrain himself he rebelleth against the bounds set by nature, and struggleth to break out of the~
prison of the belly his longing is to herald the coming Saviour. He saith, as it were Behold, the Deliverer cometh and am I to remain still bound to abide here The Word cometh, that He may set right all things and am I still to tarry in prison I will go forth. I will run before Him, and cry aloud to all men, ' Behold the Lamb of God Which taketh away the sin of the world '

[Responsory8]
R. O Holy Virgin Mary, happy indeed art thou, and right worthy of all praise,
* For out of thee rose the Sun of righteousness, even Christ our God.
V. Pray for the people, plead for the clergy, make intercession for all women vowed to God may all that make remembrance of thine holy Visitation feel the might of thine assistance.
R. For out of thee rose the Sun of righteousness.
&Gloria
R. For out of thee rose the Sun of righteousness.

!Commemoratio for the Holy Martyrs Processus and Martinian.
At what time Peter and Paul were kept in the Mamertine Prison, at the foot of the Tarpeian Rock, two of the gaolers, named Processus and Martinian, along with other forty, were moved by the preaching and miracles of the Apostles to believe in Christ, and were baptized in a spring which suddenly brake forth out of the rock. These men let the Apostles depart if they willed it. But Paulinus, Prefect of the soldiers, when he heard what was come to pass, strove to turn away Processus and Martinian from their purpose. And when he found that he but wasted time, he ordered their faces to be bruised and their teeth to be broken, with stones. Moreover, when he had had them led to the image of Jupiter, and they still boldly answered that they would not worship the gods, he caused them to be tormented on the rack, and white-hot plates of metal to be put to their flesh, and that they should be beaten with sticks. Whileas they were suffering all these things they were heard to say only this one word Blessed be the Name of the Lord. They were afterwards cast into prison, and in a little while they were taken outside the city, and slain with the axe, upon the Aurelian Way. The Lady Lucina buried their bodies upon her own farm, upon the 2nd day of July, but they were afterwards brought into the City, and are buried in the Church of the Prince of the Apostles.
