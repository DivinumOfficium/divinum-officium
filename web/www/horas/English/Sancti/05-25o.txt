!For St. Urban, Bishop and Martyr
This Urban was a Roman, who, in the reign of the Emperor Alexander Severus, by his teaching and holy life, brought many to believe in Christ. Among others was Valerian, the husband of the blessed Cecily, and Tiburtius, the brother of Valerian, both of whom afterwards bravely underwent martyrdom. It was Urban l who wrote the following words 
concerning the property of the Church: Those things which His faithful ones 
make offering of unto the Lord, must never be turned to any other use than those 
of the Church, or of our Christian brethren, or of the poor. They are the 
free-will offerings of faithful believers, the trespass offerings of sinners,
and the inheritance of the poor. He sat in the chair of Peter six years, seven 
months, and four days, and being crowned with martyrdom, was buried in the 
cemetery of Praetextatus, on the 25th day of May. He held five ordinations in 
December, wherein he ordained nine Priests, five Deacons, and eight Bishops for 
diverse places.
