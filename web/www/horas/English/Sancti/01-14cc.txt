v. Grant, we beseech thee, O Almighty God, that the example of thy Saints may continually stir us up to amend our sinful lives, that as we do solemnly commemorate them, we may also sincerely strive to imitate them.

[Lectio93]
Felix was a Priest of Nola, who on account of his fiery zeal against idolatry, suffered much persecution from the heathens, and was cast into prison. From thence an angel delivered him by night, and bade him go to Maximian, Bishop of Nola. This Bishop, enfeebled by old age, had at length despaired of power to withstand the torments of the persecutors, and had hidden, himself in a wood. Thither came Felix, by the will of God, and found the holy bishop lying half-dead upon the ground. He succoured him, and carried him upon his shoulders to the house of an holy widow. On another occasion, Felix, having again provoked the anger of the devil-worshippers, became an object of their pursuit, from which he hid himself in a narrow place between two walls. Hardly had he entered, when some spiders wove their webs across the entrance, which the enemy perceiving, concluded that no man had entered, and passed by. After leaving this hiding-place, Felix lay for three months in the house of an holy woman. After the Lord gave peace to His Church, the Saint returned to Nola, where he turned many to Christ by his life, his preaching, and his miracles. He steadily refused to accept the Bishopric, fell asleep in the Lord, and was buried at Nola in the place called The Pines.
