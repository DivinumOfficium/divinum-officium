[Ant Vespera]
God bless thee, precious cross, * be welcome to the follower of Him That hung on thee, even my Master Christ.
The blessed Andrew prayed and said: * O Lord, King of everlasting glory, receive me hanging on this gallows.
Andrew was the servant of Christ, * a worthy Apostle of God, the brother of Peter, and likened to Christ and to Peter in his death.
Christ's dear handmaid Maximilla took the body * of the Apostle and buried it with spices in an honourable place.
O Lord, Thou hast caused them that persecuted the just to be swallowed up in hell, * but to the just Thou hast thyself shown the way on the tree of the cross.

[Capitulum Vespera]
!Rom 10:10-11
v. Brothers: For, with the heart, we believe unto justice; but, with the mouth, confession is made unto salvation. For the scripture saith: Whosoever believeth in him, shall not be confounded.
$Deo gratias

[Ant 1]
One of the two * which followed the Lord was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.~
Alleluia.

[Oratio]
O Lord, we humbly beseech thy Majesty, that even as Thou didst give thy blessed Apostle Andrew to thy Church to be a teacher and a ruler on earth, so, now that he is with thee, he may continually make intercession for us.
$Per Dominum

[Ant Matutinum]
The Lord saw Peter and Andrew, * and He called them.;;18

Suffer not thy servant, O Lord, to be parted from thee * the hour is come to lay my body in the earth, and for thee to bid me come unto thyself.;;74
But Andrew besought the people * not to hinder his passion.;;96
Welcome me from among men and join me again to my Master; * that, as by thee He redeemed me, so by thee also He may take me unto Himself. Alleluia.;;98
V. Thy friends, O Lord, are made exceedingly honourable:
R. Their principality is exceedingly strengthened.

Lesson from the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans
!Rom 10:4-9
4 For the end of the law is Christ, unto justice to every one that believeth.
5 For Moses wrote, that the justice which is of the law, the man that shall do~
it, shall live by it.
6 But the justice which is of faith, speaketh thus: Say not in thy heart, Who~
shall ascend into heaven? that is, to bring Christ down;
7 Or who shall descend into the deep? that is, to bring up Christ again from the~
dead.
8 But what saith the scripture? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in~
thy heart. This is the word of faith, which we preach.
9 For if thou confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thy heart that~
God hath raised him up from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

[Responsory1]
R. The Lord, walking by the Sea of Galilee, saw Peter and Andrew casting their~
nets into the sea, and He called them saying:
* Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.
V. For they were fishers, and He saith unto them:
R. Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.

[Lectio2]
!Rom 10:10-15
10 For, with the heart, we believe unto justice; but, with the mouth, confession~
is made unto salvation.
11 For the scripture saith: Whosoever believeth in him, shall not be confounded.
12 For there is no distinction of the Jew and the Greek: for the same is Lord~
over all, rich unto all that call upon him.
13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved.
14 How then shall they call on him, in whom they have not believed? Or how shall~
they believe him, of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear, without a~
preacher?
15 And how shall they preach unless they be sent, as it is written: How~
beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, of them that~
bring glad tidings of good things!

[Responsory2]
R. As soon as the blessed Andrew heard the voice of the Lord calling him, he~
left his nets, by the exercise and use whereof he lived;
* And followed Him Who giveth life everlasting.
V. This is that disciple who for the love of Christ hung upon the cross, and~
suffered for the law of his God.
R. And followed Him Who giveth life everlasting.

[Lectio3]
!Rom 10:16-21
16 But all do not obey the gospel. For Isaias saith: Lord, who hath believed our~
report?
17 Faith then cometh by hearing; and hearing by the word of Christ.
18 But I say: Have they not heard? Yes, verily, their sound hath gone forth into~
all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the whole world.
19 But I say: Hath not Israel known? First, Moses saith: I will provoke you to~
jealousy by that which is not a nation; by a foolish nation I will anger you.
20 But Isaias is bold, and saith: I was found by them that did not seek me: I~
appeared openly to them that asked not after me.
21 But to Israel he saith: All the day long have I spread my hands to a people~
that believeth not, and contradicteth me.

[Responsory3]
R. Andrew the good teacher, the friend of God, was led to the cross, and when he~
saw it afar off, he said: God bless thee, O cross;
* Welcome to the follower of Him That hung on thee, even my Master Christ.
V. God bless thee, O cross, thou art hallowed by the Body of Christ; His Members~
make thee goodly as with pearls.
R. Be welcome to the follower of Him That hung on thee, even my Master Christ.
&Gloria
R. Be welcome to the follower of Him That hung on thee, even my Master Christ.

[Lectio4]
The Apostle Andrew was born at Bethsaida, a town of Galilee, and was the brother~
of Peter. He was a disciple of John the Baptist, and heard him say of Christ,~
Behold the Lamb of God, (John i. 35-37, 40,) whereupon he immediately followed~
Jesus, bringing his brother also with him. Some while after, they were both~
fishing in the Sea of Galilee, and the Lord Christ, going by, called them both,~
before any other of the Apostles, in the words, Follow Me, and I will make you~
fishers of men. They made no delay, but left their nets, and followed Him.~
~(Matth. iv. 18-20.) After the death and Resurrection of Christ, Andrew was~
allotted Scythia as the province of his preaching, and, after labouring there,~
he went through Epirus and Thrace, where he turned vast multitudes to Christ by~
his teaching and miracles. Finally he went to Patras in Achaia, and there also~
he brought many to the knowledge of Gospel truth. Aegeas the Pro-consul resisted~
the preaching of the Gospel, and the Apostle freely rebuked him, bidding him~
know that while he held himself a judge of his fellow men, he was himself~
hindered by devils from knowing Christ our God, the Judge of all.

[Responsory4]
R. The man of God was led to be crucified, and the people cried with a loud~
voice, saying:
* The innocent blood of this just person is condemned without a cause.
V. And when they led him out to crucify him, all the people ran together and~
cried, saying
R. The innocent blood of this just person is condemned without a cause.

[Lectio5]
Then Egeas, being angry, answered him, Boast no more of this thy Christ. He~
spake words even such as thine, but they availed Him not, and He was crucified~
by the Jews. Whereto Andrew boldly answered that Christ had given Himself up to~
die for man's salvation; but the Pro-consul blasphemously interrupted him, and~
bade him look to himself, and sacrifice to the gods. Then said Andrew, We have~
an altar, whereon day by day I offer up to God, the Almighty, the One, and the~
True, not the flesh of bulls nor the blood of goats, but a Lamb without spot~
and when all they that believe have eaten of the Flesh Thereof, the Lamb That~
was slain abideth whole and liveth. Then Aegeas being filled with wrath, bound~
the Apostle in prison. Now, the people would have delivered him, but he himself~
calmed the multitude, and earnestly besought them not to take away from him the~
crown of martyrdom, for which he longed and which was now drawing near.

[Responsory5]
R. O precious cross, which the Members of my Lord have made so fair and goodly,~
welcome me from among men, and join me again to my Master,
* That, as by thee He redeemed me, so by thee also He may take me unto Himself.
V. The blessed Andrew stretched forth his hands to heaven and prayed, saying:~
Precious cross, be my salvation,
R. That, as by thee He redeemed me, so by thee also He may take me unto Himself.

[Lectio6]
Come a short while after, he was brought before the judgment-seat, where he~
extolled the mystery of the cross, and rebuked Aegeas for his ungodliness. Then~
Aegeas could bear with him no longer, but commanded him to be crucified, in~
imitation of Christ. Andrew, then, was led to the place of martyrdom, and, as~
soon as he came in sight of the cross, he cried out, O precious cross, which the~
Members of my Lord have made so goodly, how long have I desired thee! how warmly~
have I loved thee! how constantly have I sought thee! And, now that thou art~
come to me, how is my soul drawn to thee! Welcome me from among men, and join me~
again to my Master, that as by thee He redeemed me, so by thee also He may take~
me unto Himself. So he was fastened to the cross, whereon he hung living for two~
days, during which time he ceased not to preach the faith of Christ, and,~
finally, passed into the Presence of Him the likeness of Whose death he had~
loved so well. All the above particulars of his last sufferings were written by~
the Priests and Deacons of Achaia, who bear witness to them of their own~
knowledge. Under the Emperor Constantine the bones of the Apostle were first~
taken to Constantinople, whence they were afterwards brought to Amalfi. In the~
Pontificate of Pope Pius II his head was carried to Rome, where it is kept in~
the Basilica of St. Peter.

[Responsory6]
R. All day long I have stretched forth my hands upon the cross unto a~
disobedient and gainsaying people;
* Which walketh in a way that is not good, but after their own sins.
V. The Lord God to Whom vengeance belongeth, the God to Whom vengeance~
belongeth, hath shown Himself: lift up thyself, Thou Judge of the earth, render a~
reward to the proud.
R. Which walketh in a way that is not good, but after their own sins.
&Gloria
R. Which walketh in a way that is not good, but after their own sins.

[Lectio7]
From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 4:18-22
At that time, Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon who is~
called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea (for they were~
fishers). And so on.
_
Homily by Pope St. Gregory (the Great.)
!5th on the Gospels.
Dearly beloved brethren, ye hear how that Peter and Andrew, having once heard~
the Lord call them, left their nets, and followed their Saviour. As yet they had~
seen none of His miracles, as yet they had received no promise of their~
exceeding and eternal reward; nevertheless, at one word of the Lord they forgot~
all those things which they seemed to have. We have seen many of His miracles;~
we have received many of His gracious chastenings; many times hath He warned us~
of the wrath to come and yet Christ calleth and we do not follow.

[Responsory7]
R. The holy Andrew lifted up his eyes to heaven, and prayed, and cried with a~
loud voice, and said: Thou art my God, Whom I have seen; suffer not the unjust~
judge to take me down from the cross
* For now I know what the power of thy holy Cross is.
V. Thou art Christ my Master, Whom I have loved, Whom I have known, Whom I have~
confessed in this thing hear me.
R. For now I know what the power of thy holy Cross is.

[Lectio8]
He who calleth us to be converted is now enthroned in heaven; He hath broken the~
necks of the Gentiles to the yoke of the faith, He hath laid low the glory of~
the world, and the wrecks thereof, falling ever more and more to decay, do~
preach unto us that the coming of that day when He is to be revealed as our~
Judge is drawing nigh and yet, so stubborn is our mind, that we will not yet~
freely abandon that which, will we, nill we, we lose day by day. Dearly beloved~
brethren, what shall we answer at His judgment-seat, we whom no lessons can~
persuade, and no stripes can break of the love of this present world?

[Responsory8]
R. When Andrew saw the cross he cried, saying: How wonderful art thou, O cross! O~
cross, how loveable art thou! O cross, thy bright beams enlighten the darkness~
of the whole world!
* Welcome a follower of Jesus, that, as by thee He died to redeem me, so by thee~
also He may take me unto Himself.
V. O precious cross, which the Members of my Lord have made so fair and goodly,
R. Welcome a follower of Jesus, that, as by thee He died to redeem me, so by~
thee also He may take me unto Himself.
&Gloria
R. Welcome a follower of Jesus, that, as by thee He died to redeem me, so by~
thee also He may take me unto Himself.

[Lectio9]
Perhaps one perchance will ask in his heart, what Peter or Andrew had to lose by~
obeying the call of the Lord? Dearly beloved brethren, we must consider here~
rather the intention than the loss incurred by this obedience. He that keepeth~
nothing for himself, giveth up much; he that sacrificeth his all, sacrificed~
what is to him a great deal. Beyond doubt, we cling to whatever we have, and~
what we have least, that we desire most. Peter and Andrew therefore gave up much~
when they gave up even the desire of possessing anything.
&teDeum

[Ant 2]
Spare unto us * this just man, release unto us this holy one; slay not the~
friend of God, who is just, courteous, and godly.

[Lectio Prima]
!Rom 10:16-18
v. For Isaias saith: Lord, who hath believed our report? Faith then cometh by~
hearing; and hearing by the word of Christ. But I say: Have they not heard? Yes,~
verily, their sound hath gone forth into all the earth, and their words unto the~
ends of the whole world.

[Capitulum Sexta]
!Rom 10:12-13
v. For there is no distinction of the Jew and the Greek: for the same is Lord~
over all, rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the~
name of the Lord, shall be saved.
$Deo gratias

[Ant 3]
When the blessed * Andrew came to the place where the cross was made ready, he cried and said: O precious cross, of a long time have I desired thee, and, now that thou art made ready for me, my soul is drawn to thee, and I come to thee in peace and gladness; thou also oughtest to welcome me with joy, for I am the disciple of Him Who hung on thee.
