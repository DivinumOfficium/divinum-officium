[AntMatutinumM]
The child shall be called a Nazarite. He shall drink neither wine nor strong drink, neither shall he eat any unclean thing, even from his mother's womb.;;63
For he shall be great before the Lord: for his hand is with him.;;64
He shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.;;91

[Ant Matutinum 3N]
The angel of the Lord descended to Zacharias, saying: Accept this child in your old age, and his name will be John the Baptist.

Sermon of St Maximus, bishop
!#
The natural birth of the venerable John the Baptist, dearest brethren, has made sacred the festival of this day. On this account, he was sent into this world by heavenly dispensation not only that he himself might be honored by the office of prophet, but also that the praises due all the prophets might be confirmed in him. Not undeservedly do we venerate with special honor him who by a certain, singular favor was the last to foretell the saviour of the world that he might be the first to point him out to us.

[Lectio6]
For it was he alone of the prophets who merited to see with his own eyes our Lord Jesus Christ, whom the rest foreknew would come after a long time, and to announce him as being at hand. He is the one whom, through the inspiration of God, Isaias foretold, saying: 'The voice of one crying in the desert: Prepare ye the way of the Lord.' How fittingly, dearly beloved brethren, was John announced beforehand as a voice, since he was to be sent as herald and witness of the celestial Word.

[Lectio7]
He is the one whose birth and name and merit were foretold by the Angel Gabriel. He is the one who in the judgment of a heavenly declaration is placed before all mortal men, according to the saying of our Lord, “There has not risen among them that are born of women a greater than John the Baptist.” How beautifully is it said, “Among them that are born of women there is none greatest,” for he who was born of the Virgin was in every way greater than John!

[Lectio8]
Having reflected on these things, consider what great respect, what great devotion we should tender this man, who, in order that he might be honored, was foretold by the Holy Spirit, promised by an angel, praised by God, and sanctified by the undying glory of a holy death! For it was fitting that a wonderful life should follow his extraordinary birth, and that a death consecrated to God should close his holy and perfect life. Consequently, brethren, dœs Christ's Church over the whole world most correctly  celebrate today with the greatest joy the first moments of the life of him who, as a most faithful witness, revealed to the awestruck world that eternal joys were come to mortal men.

[Responsory8]
R. Among those born of women there arose none greater than John the Baptist
* who prepared the way of the Lord in the wilderness.
V. This man came for a witness, to give testimony of the light.
R. Who prepared the way of the Lord in the wilderness.
V. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost.
R. Who prepared the way of the Lord in the wilderness.
