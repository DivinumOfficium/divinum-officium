[AntMatutinumM]
This is God, our God unto eternity, and for ever and ever: he shall rule us for evermore.;;47
In Him shall all the tribes of the earth be blessed; all the nations shall proclaim His greatness.;;71
Say ye among the Gentiles, the Lord hath reigned, He shall judge the world with justice, and the people with his truth.;;95
The Lord hath reigned, let the earth rejoice: let many islands be glad.;;96
Make a joyful noise before the Lord our king: because he cometh to judge the earth.;;97
Exalt ye the Lord our God, and adore at his holy mountain: for the Lord our God is holy.;;98

[Ant Matutinum 3N]
Christ is given all principality and the honour of the kingdom: all peoples and tribes and languages will serve him forever.
