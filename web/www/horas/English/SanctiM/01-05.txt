[Oratio]
O Almighty and everlasting God, do Thou order all our actions in conformity with~
thy good pleasure, that through the name of thy well-beloved Son, we may~
worthily abound in all good works.
$Per Dominum

[Lectio1]
From the letter of blessed Apostle Paul to the Romans
!Rom 7:1-3
1 Know you not, brethren, for I speak to them that know the law, that the law~
hath dominion over a man, as long as it liveth?
2 For the woman that hath an husband, whilst her husband liveth is bound to the~
law. But if her husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.
3 Therefore, whilst her husband liveth, she shall be called an adulteress, if~
she be with another man: but if her husband be dead, she is delivered from the~
law of her husband; so that she is not an adulteress, if she be with another~
man.

!Rom 7:4-6
4 Therefore, my brethren, you also are become dead to the law, by the body of~
Christ; that you may belong to another, who is risen again from the dead, that~
we may bring forth fruit to God.
5 For when we were in the flesh, the passions of sins, which were by the law,~
did work in our members, to bring forth fruit unto death.
6 But now we are loosed from the law of death, wherein we were detained; so that~
we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.

!Rom 7:7-9
7 What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? God forbid. But I do not know sin,~
but by the law; for I had not known concupiscence, if the law did not say: Thou~
shalt not covet.
8 But sin taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of~
concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.
9 And I lived some time without the law. But when the commandment came, sin~
revived,
