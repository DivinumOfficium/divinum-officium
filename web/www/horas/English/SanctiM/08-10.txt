Blessed Lawrence * cried out and said: I care for my God, and serve him alone.;;23
He hath dispersed and gave to the poor; * his justice shall remain in ages of ages.;;63
I am thy protector, do not fear; * if you pass through fire, the flame will not harm thee, and the scent of fire will not be upon thee.;;91

[Ant Matutinum 3N]
Unless the grain of wheat * falls to the ground and dies, it only remains as such.
