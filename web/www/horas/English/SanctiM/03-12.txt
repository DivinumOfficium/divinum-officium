[Hymnus Vespera]
Of Angles once Apostle thou,
Companion of the angels now,
O Gregory, protect our race,
By faith in Christ restored to grace.
_
Earth’s wealth and riches though didst spurn,
And from its dazzling glory turn
To follow, needy, Christ the King,
Like him, too, lacking everything.
_
On outstretched hand though dost bestow
Two coins a silver dish when lo!
Neath shipwrecked sorry garb concealed,
A noble angel stands revealed.
_
Thenceforth Christ sets thee over his fold,
This teaching church to rule, This teaching place to hold;
To Peter’s honours thou art led,
For in his steps thou firm didst tread.
_
O Pontifex, high abovo all praise,
The Church’s light in thousand ways,
O leave us not in dangers sore,
Once taught and guided by thy lore.
_
All praise to God the Father be,
All praise, Eternal Son to Thee,
And equal glory, as is meet,
To God the Holy Paraclete.
Amen.
