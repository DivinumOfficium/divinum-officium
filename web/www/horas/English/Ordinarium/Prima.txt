#Hymn
v. Now in the sun's new dawning ray,
Lowly of heart, our God we pray
That he from harm may keep us free
In all the deeds this day shall see.
_
May fear of him our tongues restrain,
Lest strife unguarded speech should stain:
His favouring care our guardian be,
Lest our eyes feed on vanity.
_
May every heart be pure from sin
And folly find no place therein:
Scant need of food, excess denied,
Wear down in us the body's pride.
_
That when the light of day is gone,
And night in course shall follow on.
We, free from cares the world affords,
May chant the praise that is our Lord's.
_
* All laud to God the Father be,
All praise, Eternal Son, to thee:
All glory, as is ever meet,
To God the holy Paraclete.
Amen.
