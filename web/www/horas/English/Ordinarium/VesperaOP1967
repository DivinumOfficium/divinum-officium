#Canticle of the Blessed Virgin Mary
!Luke I
My soul glorifies the Lord * my spirit rejoices in God, my Saviour. 
_
He looks on his servant in her nothingness; henceforth all ages will call me blessed.
_
The Almighty works marvels for me. * Holy his name! 
_
His mercy is from age to age, * on those who fear him.
_
He puts forth his arm in strength * and scatters the proud-hearted. 
_
He casts the mighty from their thrones * and raised the lowly. 
_
He fills the starving with good things, * sends the rich away empty. 
_
He protects Israel, his servant, * remembering his mercy, the mercy he promised to our fathers, * for Abraham and his son for ever.
&Gloria
Amen

Lord, have mercy.

And lead us not into temptation.
R. But deliver us from evil.

The Lord be with you.

Let us bless the Lord. 
R. Thanks be to God.
