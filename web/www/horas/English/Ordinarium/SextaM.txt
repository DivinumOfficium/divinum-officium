v. O God of truth, O Lord of might,
Who orderest time and change aright,
Who send’st the early morning ray,
And light’st the glow of perfect day:
_
Extinguish thou each sinful fire,
And banish every ill desire;
And while thou keep’st the body whole,
Shed forth thy peace upon the soul.
_
* Almighty Father, hear our cry,
Through Jesus Christ, our Lord most High,
Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,
Doth live and reign eternally.
Amen.
