[AntMatutinumM]
Thy name is as oil poured out: * therefore young maidens have loved thee.;;96
O my love, * sweet and comely as Jerusalem: terrible as an army set in array.;;97
She hath girded * her loins with strength, and hath strengthened her arm.;;98
And at midnight * there was a cry made: Behold the bridegroom cometh, go ye forth to meet him.;;249;250;251
