Continuation ++ of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 19:27-29.
At that time, Peter said to Jesus, Behold, we have left all and followed You;~
what then shall we have? And Jesus said to them, Amen I say to you that you who~
have followed Me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man shall sit on the~
throne of His glory, shall also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve~
 tribes of Israel. And everyone who has~
left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children,~
or lands, for My name’s sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall possess~
life everlasting.
