(Canticum Sophonee * Soph 3:8-13)
3:8 Wherefore expect me, saith the Lord, in the day of my resurrection that is to come, for my judgment is to assemble the Gentiles, and to gather the kingdoms:
3:8 And to pour upon them my indignation, all my fierce anger:
3:8 For with the fire of my jealousy shall all the earth be devoured.
3:9 Because then I will restore to the people a chosen lip, that all may call upon the name of the Lord, and may serve him with one shoulder.
3:10 From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, shall my suppliants the children of my dispersed people bring me an offering.
3:11 In that day thou shalt not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me:
3:11 For then I will take away out of the midst of thee thy proud boasters, and thou shalt no more be lifted up because of my holy mountain.
3:12 And I will leave in the midst of thee a poor and needy people: and they shall hope in the name of the Lord.
3:13 The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies, nor shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth:
3:13 For they shall feed, and shall lie down, and there shall be none to make them afraid..
