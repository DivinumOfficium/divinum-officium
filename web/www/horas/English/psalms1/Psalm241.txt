(Canticum Isaiae * Isa 42:10-16)
42:10 Sing ye to the Lord a new song, * his praise is from the ends of the earth.
42:10 You that go down to the sea, and all that are therein: * ye islands, and ye inhabitants of them.
42:11 Let the desert and the cities thereof be exalted: * Cedar shall dwell in houses:
42:11 Ye inhabitants of Petra, give praise, * they shall cry from the top of the mountains.
42:12 They shall give glory to the Lord, * and shall declare his praise in the islands.
42:13 The Lord shall go forth as a mighty man, * as a man of war shall he stir up zeal.
42:13 He shall shout and cry: * he shall prevail against his enemies.
42:14 I have always held my peace, I have I kept silence, I have been patient, * I will speak now as a woman in labour.
42:14 I will destroy, and swallow up at once. * I will lay waste the mountains and hills, and will make all their grass to wither.
42:15 And I will turn rivers into islands* , and will dry up the standing pools.
42:16 And I will lead the blind into the way which they know not: * and in the paths which they were ignorant of I will make them walk.
42:16 I will make darkness light before them, * and crooked things straight.
