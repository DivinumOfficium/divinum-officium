Upon the 16th day of May, was born into the better life: 
_ 
At Bordeaux, in Aquitaine, the holy Confessor Simon, surnamed Stock, [for that he lived at one time in the stock of an hollow oak,] of the Order of Carmelites, who by his singular devotion toward the Virgin Mother of God won to obtain of her the sacred scapular of his Order, and, after many labours borne in the governing of the same her Order, passed away famous for miracles, to receive his everlasting reward.  
At Gubbio, holy Ubald, Bishop [of the same city,] who was famous for miracles, and whose feast we keep upon the 22nd day of this present month of May. 
In Isauria, the holy martyrs Aquilinus and Victorian. 
At Auxerre, suffered the holy martyr Peregrin, first Bishop of that city, who was sent into Gaul with other clerks by blessed Pope Sixtus [II], and, when he had finished the work preaching the Gospel, was condemned to be beheaded, and so earned a crown of life that fadeth not away.

In Palestine, the passion of the holy monks who were massacred by the Saracens in the Monastery of St Saba.
