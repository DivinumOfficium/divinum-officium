Upon the 21st day of June, were born into the better life:  
_
At Rome, [in the year 1591,] holy Aloysius Gonzaga, of the Society of Jesus, illustrious for his contempt of earthly rank, and for the innocency of his life. 
Also at Rome, the holy Virgin Demetria, who was crowned with martyrdom under the Emperor Julian the Apostate. 
At Syracuse, in Sicily, the holy martyrs Rufinus and Marcia. 
In Africa, the holy martyrs Cyriacus and Apollinaris. 
At Mainz, the holy martyr Alban, who after long toil and stern contending for Christ's faith was made worthy of the crown of life. 
On the same day, holy Eusebius of Samosata. In the time of the Arian Emperor Constantius he used to visit the Churches of God, disguised as a soldier, to confirm them in the Catholic faith. Under Valens he was banished into Thrace. After peace was restored to the Church in the time of Theodosius he was called back from exile, and was visiting the churches again when an Arian woman dropped a tile upon him from a height which cracked his skull, and so he died a martyr at last, [in the year 380.] 
At Iconium, in Lycaonia, the holy martyr Terence, Bishop [of that see.] 
At Pavia, [in the year 216,] the holy Confessor Urciscenus, Bishop [of that see.] 
At Tongres, holy Martin, Bishop [of that see.] 
At Évreux, the holy Abbot Leufroi, [about the year 738.]
