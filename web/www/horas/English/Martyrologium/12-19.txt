_
At Alexandria, in Egypt, the blessed martyr Nemesius. He was first brought before the judge on a false accusation that he was a thief, and was acquitted but in the persecution under the Emperor Decius he was accused of Christianity before the judge Aemilian, by whom he was put to the double punishment and condemned to be burnt along with thieves. In the which thing he was conformed to the likeness of the Saviour, who was crucified between thieves.
