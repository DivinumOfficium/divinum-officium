On the morrow we keep the feast of the holy Confessor and Doctor of the Church, John of Damascus, famous for holiness and teaching. He strove manfully for the honouring of the holy images, both by word and writing, against the Emperor Leo the Isaurian wherefore the Emperor commanded that his right hand should be smitten off; whereupon he commended himself to the image of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which he had defended, and forthwith he received back his hand whole and sound. Of whom mention is made upon the 6th day of May.
