St. Philip Neri, of whom mention is made in the Martyrology for May 26. 
Upon the same 15th day of June, were born into the better life: 
At the river Silaro, in Lucania, the holy martyrs Vitus, Modestus, and Crescentia, who were brought thither from Sicily under the Emperor Diocletian there by the power of God they overcame boiling lead and wild beasts, and finished the course of their glorious fight by being broken alive upon a block. 
At Dorostorum, in Mysia, the holy soldier Hesychius, who was arrested along with blessed Julius, and was crowned with martyrdom after him, under the President Maximus. 
At Cordova, in Spain, [in the persecution under the Muslims,] the holy martyr Benildes. 
At Zephyrium, in Cilicia, the holy martyr Dulas, who under the President Maximus was for Christ's Name's sake beaten with rods, laid upon a gridiron and smeared with burning oil, and suffered other things also, and so as a conqueror grasped the palm of martyrdom. 
At Palmyra, in Syria, the holy sisters Libya and Leonis, and Eutropia, a damsel of twelve years of age, who through diverse torments attained unto the crown of martyrdom. 
At Valenciennes, [in the year 686,] the holy Landalin, Abbot [of Crespin.] 
At Clermont, [in the year 472,] the holy Confessor Abraham, [Abbot of St. Cirgues,] illustrious for his holiness and wonderful works. 
At Valais, [in the year 1008,] the holy Confessor Bernard of Menthon. 
At Pibrac, in the Diocese of Toulouse, the holy Virgin Germaine Cousin, a shepherdess, who lived poor and lowly, and after many woes, borne with the greatest long-suffering, passed away to the Divine Bridegroom, [in the year 1601.] After her death she became famous for many miracles, and the Supreme Pontiff Pius IX. enrolled her name among those of the holy Virgins.
