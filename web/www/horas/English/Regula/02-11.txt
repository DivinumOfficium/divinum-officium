02-11# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 9: How Many Psalms Are to Be Said At the Night Hours
_
In the above-written time of winter, first, the verse, “O God, make speed to save us; O Lord, make haste to help us,” with Gloria, having been put first, there is to be said, secondly, “O Lord, open Thou my lips and my mouth shall show forth Thy praise” three times, to which is to be subjoined the third psalm and Gloria and after this the ninety-fourth psalm with antiphon should be said or indeed sung. After this let the Ambrosian hymn follow and then six psalms with antiphons; which said and the versicle said, let the abbot ask a blessing and, all sitting on the benches, let three lections be read in turn by the brethren from a book on the reading-stand, between which lections let there be also three responsories sung. Let two responsories be without Gloria, but after the third lection let him who sings begin the Gloria and when the singer begins it let all forthwith rise from their seats in reverence and honour of the Holy Trinity. But let it be the books of divine authority that are read at night office, alike of the Old Testament and of the New; and also those expositions of them which have been compiled by the most renowned of the orthodox catholic fathers. And after these three lections with their responsories, let there follow another six psalms to be sung with Alle­luia. After these let a lection from the Apostle follow, to be recited by heart and a versicle and the supplication of the litany, that is Kyrie eleison. And so let the night office end.
