v. Lo, the dim shadows of the night are waning;
Lightsome and blushing, dawn of day returneth;
Fervent in spirit, to the world’s Creator
Pray we devoutly:

That he may pity sinners in their sighing,
Banish all troubles, kindly health bestowing;
And may he grant us, of his countless blessings,
Peace that is endless.

Whose is the glory, which through all creation
Ever resoundeth.

[Hymnus Day0 Laudes2]
v. Maker of all, eternal King, 
Who day and night about dost bring:
Who weary mortals to relieve, 
Dost in their times the seasons give:
_
Now the shrill cock proclaims the day,
And calls the sun’s awak’ning ray 
The wand’ring pilgrim’s guiding light,
That marks the watches night by night.
_
Roused at the note, the morning star
Heaven’s dusky veil uplifts afar:
Night’s vagrant bands no longer roam,
But from their dark ways hie them home.
_
The encouraged sailor’s fears are o’er,
The foaming billows rage no more:
Lo! e’en the very Church’s rock 
Melts at the crowing of the cock.
_
O let us then like men arise; 
The cock rebukes our slumbering eyes,
Bestirs who still in sleep would lie,
And shames who would their Lord deny.
_
New hope his clarion-note awakes, 
Sickness the feeble frame forsakes, 
The robber sheathes his lawless sword,
Faith to the fallen is restored.
_
Look on us, Jesu, when we fall, 
And with thy look our souls recall:
If thou but look, our sins are gone,
And with due tears our pardon won.
_
Shed through our hearts thy piercing ray,
Our souls’ dull slumber drive away:
Thy name be first on every tongue,
To thee our earliest praises sung.
_
All laud to God the Father be,
All praise, Eternal Son, to thee,
All glory, as is ever meet,
To God the holy Paraclete.
Amen.

v. O blest Creator of the light, 
Who mak’st the day with radiance bright,
And o’er the forming world didst call
The light from chaos first of all;
_
Whose wisdom joined in meet array
The morn and eve, and named them day:
Night comes with all its darkling fears;
Regard thy people’s prayers and tears.
_
Lest, sunk in sin, and whelmed with strife,
They lose the gift of endless life; 
While thinking but the thoughts of time,
They weave new chains of woe and crime.
_
But grant them grace that they may strain
The heavenly gate and prize to gain:
Each harmful lure aside to cast, 
And purge away each error past.
_
* O Father, that we ask be done, 
Through Jesus Christ, thine only Son;
Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,
Doth live and reign eternally.
Amen.

v. O splendour of God’s glory bright,
O thou that bringest light from light,
O light of light, light’s living spring,
O day, all days illumining.
_
O thou true sun, on us thy glance 
Let fall in royal radiance, 
The Spirit’s sanctifying beam 
Upon our earthly senses stream.
_
The Father too our prayers implore,
Father of glory evermore, 
The Father of all grace and might, 
To banish sin from our delight:
_
To guide whate’er we nobly do,
With love all envy to subdue,
To make ill-fortune turn to fair,
And give us grace our wrongs to bear.
_
Our mind be in his keeping placed,
Our body true to him and chaste, 
Where only faith her fire shall feed,
And burn the tares of Satan’s seed.
_
And Christ to us for food shall be, 
From him our drink that welleth free,
The Spirit’s wine, that maketh whole,
And mocking not, exalts the soul.
_
Rejoicing may this day go hence,
Like virgin dawn our innocence,
Like fiery noon our faith appear,
Nor know the gloom of twilight drear.
_
Morn in her rosy car is borne; 
Let him come forth our perfect morn,
The Word in God the Father One, 
The Father perfect in the Son.

All praise, Eternal Son, to thee;
All glory, as is ever meet,

[Hymnus Day1 Vespera]
v. O great Creator of the sky, 
Who wouldest not the floods on high
With earthly waters to confound, 
But mad’st the firmament their bound;
_
The floods above thou didst ordain;
The floods below thou didst restrain:
That moisture might attemper heat,
Lest the parched earth should ruin meet.
_
Upon our souls, good Lord, bestow
Thy gift of grace in endless flow:
Lest some renewed deceit or wile
Of former sin should us beguile.
_
Let faith discover heav’nly light;
So shall its rays direct us right:
And let this faith each error chase,
And never give to falsehood place.
_
Grant this, O Father, ever One 
With Christ, thy sole-begotten Son,
And Holy Ghost, whom all adore, 
Reigning and blest forevermore.
Amen.

[Hymnus Day2 Laudes]
v. As the bird, whose clarion gay 
Sounds before the dawn is grey,
Christ, who brings the spirit’s day, 
Calls us, close at hand:
_
Wake! he cries, and for my sake,
From your eyes dull slumbers shake!
Sober, righteous, chaste, awake! 
At the door I stand!
_
Lord, to thee we lift on high
Fervent prayer and bitter cry:
Hearts aroused to pray and sigh 
May not slumber more:
_
Break the sleep of death and time, 
Forged by Adam’s ancient crime; 
And the light of Eden’s prime 
To the world restore!
_
Unto God the Father, Son, 
Holy Spirit, Three in One, 
One in Three, be glory done,
Now and evermore.

[Hymnus Day2 Vespera]
v. Earth's mighty Maker, whose command
Raised from the sea the solid land; 
And drove each billowy heap away,
And bade the earth stand firm for aye:
_
That so, with flowers of golden hue,
The seeds of each it might renew; 
And fruit-trees bearing fruit might yield,
And pleasant pasture of the field:
_
Our spirit’s rankling wounds efface
With dewy freshness of thy grace:
That grief may cleanse each deed of ill,
And o’er each lust may triumph still.
_
Let every soul thy law obey, 
And keep from every evil way; 
Rejoice each promised good to win,
And flee from every mortal sin.
_
Hear thou our prayer, Almighty King!
Hear thou our praises, while we sing,
Adoring with the heavenly host, 
The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!
Amen.

[Hymnus Day3 Laudes]
v. Day is breaking, dawn is bright:
Hence, vain shadows of the night! 
Mists that dim our mortal sight,
Christ is come! Depart!
_
Darkness routed lifts her wings
As the radiance upwards springs:
Through the world of wakened things
Life and colour dart.
_
Thee, O Christ, alone we know:
Singing even in our woe, 
With pure hearts to thee we go:
On our senses shine!
_
In thy beams be purged away 
All that leads our thoughts astray! 
Through our spirits, King of day,
Pour thy light divine!

[Hymnus Day3 Vespera]
v. O God, whose hand hath spread the sky,
And all its shining hosts on high,
And painting it with fiery light,
Made it so beauteous and so bright:
_
Thou, when the fourth day was begun,
Didst frame the circle of the sun, 
And set the moon for ordered change,
And planets for their wider range:
_
To night and day, by certain line, 
Their varying bounds thou didst assign;
And gav’st a signal, known and meet,
For months begun and months complete.
_
Enlighten thou the hearts of men:
Polluted souls make pure again:
Unloose the bands of guilt within:
Remove the burden of our sin.
_
Grant this, O Father, ever One
With Christ thy sole-begotten Son,
Whom, with the Spirit we adore, 
One God, both now and evermore.
Amen.

[Hymnus Day4 Laudes]
v. See the golden sun arise!
Let no more our darkened eyes
Snare us, tangled by surprise 
In the maze of sin!
_
From false words and thoughts impure
Let this light, serene and sure, 
Keep our lips without secure,
Keep our souls within.
_
So may we the day-time spend, 
That, till life’s temptations end, 
Tongue, nor hand, nor eye offend!
One, above us all,
_
Views in his revealing ray 
All we do, and think, and say, 
Watching us from break of day
Till the twilight fall.
_
Unto God the Father, Son, 
Holy Spirit, Three in One, 
One in Three, be glory done,
Now and evermore.
Amen.

[Hymnus Day4 Vespera]
v. O sovereign Lord of nature’s might, 
Who bad’st the water’s birth divide;
Part in the heavens to take their flight,
And part in ocean’s deep to hide; 
_
These low obscured, on airy wing 
Exalted those, that either race, 
Though from one element they spring,
Might serve thee in a different place.
_
Grant, Lord, that we thy servants all,
Saved by thy tide of cleansing blood,
No more ’neath sin's dominion fall,
Nor fear the thought of death’s dark flood!
_
Thy varied love each spirit bless, 
The humble cheer, the high control;
Check in each heart its proud excess,
But raise the meek and contrite soul!
_
This boon, O Father, we entreat,
This blessing grant, Eternal Son,
And Holy Ghost, the Paraclete,
Both now, and while the ages run.
Amen.

[Hymnus Day5 Laudes]
v. O Christ, whose glory fills the heaven,
Our only hope, in mercy given;
Child of a Virgin meek and pure;
Son of the Highest evermore:
_
Grant us thine aid thy praise to sing,
As opening days new duties bring; 
That with the light our life may be
Renewed and sanctified by thee.
_
The morning star fades from the sky,
The sun breaks forth; night’s shadows fly:
O Thou, true Light, upon us shine:
Our darkness turn to light divine.
_
Within us grant thy light to dwell;
And from our souls dark sins expel;
Cleanse thou our minds from stain of ill,
And with thy peace our bosoms fill.
_
To us strong faith forever give,
With joyous hope, in thee to live;
That life’s rough way may ever be
Made strong and pure by charity.

All laud to God the Father be,
All praise, Eternal Son, to thee:
All glory, as is ever meet,

[Hymnus Day5 Vespera]
v. Maker of man, who from thy throne
Dost order all things, God alone;
By whose decree the teeming earth
To reptile and to beast gave birth:
_
The mighty forms that fill the land,
Instinct with life at thy command,
Are given subdued to humankind 
For service in their rank assigned.
_
From all thy servants drive away 
Whate’er of thought impure to-day 
Hath been with open action blent, 
Or mingled with the heart’s intent.
_
In heaven thine endless joys bestow,
And grant thy gifts of grace below;
From chains of strife our souls release,
Bind fast the gentle bands of peace.
_
Grant this, O Father, ever One
With Christ, thy sole-begotten Son,
Whom, with the Spirit we adore, 
One God, both now and evermore.

Its golden shower, as day flows in;
Fast mount the pointed shafts of light:
Farewell to darkness and to sin!

Away, ye midnight phantoms all!
Away, despondence and despair!
Whatever guilt the night has brought,
Now let it vanish into air.

So, Lord, when that last morning breaks,
Looking to which we sigh and pray,
O may it to thy minstrels prove 
The dawning of a better day.

And to his sole-begotten Son;
Glory, O Holy Ghost, to thee,
While everlasting ages run,

For that this he freely willed:
On the cross the Lamb is lifted, 
Where his life-blood shall be spilled.

Blood and water forth proceed:
Earth, and stars, and sky, and ocean,

None in foliage, none in blossom,
None in fruit thy peers may be;

For awhile the ancient rigour,
That thy birth bestowed, suspend;
And the King of heavenly beauty

Who hath washed us in the tide
Flowing from his piercèd side.
_
Praise we him whose love divine
Gives the guests his blood for wine,
Gives his body for the feast, 
Love the victim, love the priest.
_
Where the paschal blood is poured,
Death’s dark angel sheathes his sword;
Israel’s hosts triumphant go 
Through the wave that drowns the foe.
_
Christ, the Lamb whose blood was shed,
Paschal victim, paschal bread;
With sincerity and love
Eat we manna from above.
_
Mighty victim from the sky,
Powers of hell beneath thee lie;
Death is conquered in the fight;
Thou hast brought us life and light.
_
Now thy banner thou dost wave;
Vanquished Satan and the grave;
Angels join his praise to tell —
See o’erthrown the prince of hell.
_
Paschal triumph, paschal joy,
Only sin can this destroy;
From the death of sin set free,
Souls re-born, dear Lord, in Thee.
_
* Hymns of glory, songs of praise,
Father, unto thee we raise;
Risen Lord, all praise to thee,
Ever with the Spirit be.
Amen.
