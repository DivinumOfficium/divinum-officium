68:2 Save me, O God: * for the waters are come in even unto my soul.
68:3 I stick fast in the mire of the deep: * and there is no sure standing.
68:3 I am come into the depth of the sea: * and a tempest hath overwhelmed me.
68:4 I have laboured with crying; my jaws are become hoarse: * my eyes have failed, whilst I hope in my God.
68:5 They are multiplied above the hairs of my head, * who hate me without cause.
68:5 My enemies are grown strong who have wrongfully persecuted me: * then did I pay that which I took not away.
68:6 O God, thou knowest my foolishness; * and my offences are not hidden from thee.
68:7 Let not them be ashamed for me, who look for thee, O Lord, * the Lord of hosts.
68:7 Let them not be confounded on my account, * who seek thee, O God of Israel.
68:8 Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; * shame hath covered my face.
68:9 I am become a stranger to my brethren, * and an alien to the sons of my mother.
68:10 For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up: * and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.
68:11 And I covered my soul in fasting: * and it was made a reproach to me.
68:12 And I made haircloth my garment: * and I became a byword to them.
68:13 They that sat in the gate spoke against me: * and they that drank wine made me their song.
68:13 But as for me, my prayer is to thee, O Lord; * for the time of thy good pleasure, O God.
68:14 In the multitude of thy mercy hear me, * in the truth of thy salvation.
68:15 Draw me out of the mire, that I may not stick fast: * deliver me from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.
68:16 Let not the tempest of water drown me, nor the deep swallow me up: * and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
68:17 Hear me, O Lord, for thy mercy is kind; * look upon me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.
68:18 And turn not away thy face from thy servant: * for I am in trouble, hear me speedily.
68:19 Attend to my soul, and deliver it: * save me because of my enemies.
68:20 Thou knowest my reproach, and my confusion, * and my shame.
68:21 In thy sight are all they that afflict me; * my heart hath expected reproach and misery.
68:21 And I looked for one that would grieve together with me, * but there was none: and for one that would comfort me, and I found none.
68:22 And they gave me gall for my food, * and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
68:23 Let their table become as a snare before them, * and a recompense, and a stumblingblock.
68:24 Let their eyes be darkened that they see not; * and their back bend thou down always.
68:25 Pour out thy indignation upon them: * and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.
68:26 Let their habitation be made desolate: * and let there be none to dwell in their tabernacles.
68:27 Because they have persecuted him whom thou hast smitten; * and they have added to the grief of my wounds.
68:28 Add thou iniquity upon their iniquity: * and let them not come into thy justice.
68:29 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; * and with the just let them not be written.
68:30 I am poor and sorrowful: * thy salvation, O God, hath set me up.
68:31 I will praise the name of God with a canticle: * and I will magnify him with praise.
68:32 And it shall please God better than a young calf, * that bringeth forth horns and hoofs.
68:33 Let the poor see and rejoice: * seek ye God, and your soul shall live.
68:34 For the Lord hath heard the poor: * and hath not despised his prisoners.
68:35 Let the heavens and the earth praise him; * the sea, and every thing that creepeth therein.
68:36 For God will save Sion, * and the cities of Juda shall be built up.
68:36 And they shall dwell there, * and acquire it by inheritance.
68:37 And the seed of his servants shall possess it; * and they that love his name shall dwell therein.
