[Lectio1]
Lesson from the book of Job
!Job 3:1-5
1 After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed his day,
2 and he said:
3 Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said: A man child is conceived.
4 Let that day be turned into darkness, let not God regard it from above, and let not the light shine upon it.
5 Let darkness, and the shadow of death cover it, let a mist overspread it, and let it be wrapped up in bitterness.

[Lectio2]
!Job 3:6-10
6 Let a darksome whirlwind seize upon that night, let it not be counted in the days of the year, nor numbered in the months.
7 Let that night be solitary, and not worthy of praise.
8 Let them curse it who curse the day. who are ready to raise up a leviathan:
9 Let the stars be darkened with the mist thereof: let it expect light and not see it, nor the rising of the dawning of the day:
10 Because it shut not up the doors of the womb that bore me, nor took away evils from my eyes.

[Lectio3]
!Job 3:11-16
11 Why did I not die in the womb, why did I not perish when I came out of the belly?
12 Why received upon the knees? why suckled at the breasts?
13 For now I should have been asleep and still, and should have rest in my sleep.
14 With kings and consuls of the earth, who build themselves solitudes:
15 Or with princes, that possess gold, and All their houses with silver:
16 Or as a hidden untimely birth I should not be, or as they that being conceived have not seen the light.
