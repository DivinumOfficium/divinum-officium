Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 12:38-50
In that time, some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying: Master, we would see a sign from thee. Who answering said to them: An evil and adulterous generation seeketh a sign. And so on.
_
Homily by St. Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!7th Bk. on Luke, ch. xii
After the condemnation of the Jewish people, the mystery of the Church is plainly declared in the figures of the repentant Ninevites, and of the Queen of the South. Like that Queen, the Church cometh from the uttermost parts of the earth, to hear the wisdom of the true Solomon, the Prince of Peace. A Queen she is, and a Queen of one indivisible realm, wrought into one body out of all nations, however diverse and distant.

[Lectio2]
And thus cometh that great mystery of Christ and the Church, a mystery more excellent now in the fulness of truth, than in the ancient type. For there they had in Solomon only a type of that which Christ is now in His own Person. And the Church is of two classes, whereof the one knoweth not how to sin, and the other sinneth no more. To wash away sin is the work of repentance, to eschew it that of wisdom.

[Lectio3]
Lastly, the sign of the Prophet Jonas, as it was a figure of the Lord's sufferings, was also a witness to the gravity of those sins which the Jews committed. At the same time, we see in these words of the Lord a declaration at once of His power, and of His love; for, by turning our eyes on the Ninevites, He showeth us a way of escape, while He setteth before us the horror of what will otherwise be our punishment. Even the Jews need not cease to hope for pardon, if only they would repent.

[Responsory3]
R. Shut up alms in the breast of the poor, and it shall plead for you with the Lord.
* For, as water will quench fire, so alms maketh an atonement for sins.
V. Give alms, and, behold, all things are clean unto you.
R. For, as water will quench fire, so alms maketh an atonement for sins.
&Gloria
R. For, as water will quench fire, so alms maketh an atonement for sins.

[Ant 2]
This evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; * and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the Prophet Jonas.

[Oratio 2]
O Lord, we beseech thee mercifully to hear our prayers, and to stretch forth the right hand of thy power against all things that fight against us.
$Per Dominum.

[Ant 3]
As Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly, * so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.

[Oratio 3]
O Lord, we beseech thee to cast thy bright beams of light upon our mind, that we may clearly see whatsoever things Thou wouldst have us to do, and have strength to do always that which is pleasing in thy sight.
$Per Dominum.
