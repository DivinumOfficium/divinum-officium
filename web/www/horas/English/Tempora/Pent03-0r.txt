[Ant 1]
And all Israel * from Dan to Bersabee, knew that Samuel was a faithful prophet of the Lord.

[Versum 1]
V. Let the evening prayer ascend unto thee, O Lord.
R. And let there descend upon us thy mercy.

[Oratio]
O God, the Protector of all them that trust in thee, without Whom nothing is strong, nothing is Holy; increase and multiply upon us thy mercy, that Thou being our ruler and guide, we may so pass through things temporal, that we finally lose not the things eternal.

Lesson from the first book of Samuel
!1 Sam 9:18-21
18 And Saul came to Samuel in the midst of the gate and said: Tell me, I pray thee, where is the house of the seer?
19 And Samuel answered Saul, saying: I am the seer, go up before me to the high place, that you may eat with me today, and I will let thee go in the morning: and tell thee all that is in thy heart.
20 And as for the asses, which were lost three days ago, be not solicitous, because they are found. And for whom shall be all the best things of Israel? Shall they not be for thee and for all thy father's house?
21 And Saul answering, said: Am not I a son of Jemini of the least tribe of Israel, and my kindred the last among all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then hast thou spoken this word to me?

[Responsory1]
R. Prepare your hearts unto the Lord, and serve Him Only
* And He will deliver you out of the hand of your enemies.
V. Return unto Him with all your hearts, and put away the strange gods from among you.
R. And He will deliver you out of the hand of your enemies.

!1 Sam 9:22-25
22 Then Samuel taking Saul and his servant, brought them into the parlour, and gave them a place at the head of them that were invited. For there were about thirty men.
23 And Samuel said to the cook: Bring the portion, which I gave thee, and commanded thee to set it apart by thee.
24 And the cook took up the shoulder, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said: Behold what is left, set it before thee, and eat: because it was kept of purpose for thee, when I invited the people. And Saul ate with Samuel that day.
25 And they went down from the high place into the town, and he spoke with Saul upon the top of the house: and he prepared a bed for Saul on the top of the house, and he slept.

[Responsory2]
R. God, Which heareth all, even He sent His Angel, and took me from keeping my father's sheep, and
* Anointed me with the oil of His mercy.
V. The Lord That delivered me out of the mouth of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear
R. And anointed me with the oil of His mercy.

[Lectio3]
!1 Sam 9:26-27;10:1
26 And when they were risen in the morning, and it began now to be light, Samuel called Saul on the top of the house, saying: Arise, that I may let thee go. And Saul arose: and they went out both of them, to wit, he and Samuel.
27 And as they were going down in the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul: Speak to the servant to go before us, and pass on: but stand thou still a while, that I may tell thee the word of the Lord.
1 And Samuel took a little vial of oil and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said: Behold, the Lord hath anointed thee to be prince over his inheritance, and thou shalt deliver his people out of the hands of their enemies, that are round about them.

From the Exposition of blessed Gregorius Pope in the book of Kings.
!Lib. 4. cap. 5. in I. Eeg. c. 10.
Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it over his head. Clearly this annointing expresses what has become a custom in Holy Church : for he who is made one of her Princes receives the sacrament of anointing. Now, since this anointing is a sacrament, he who is thus promoted is well anointed outwardly, if he is inwardly strengthened by sacramental power.  First, then, let us consider the virtues of oil. Oil is superior to other liquids, in that it feeds flame and is wont to heal wounds. It therefore signifies mercy, as it is written of the Lord, His mercy is over all His works. In that it feeds flame, it signifies preaching which enlightens the mind of the elect.

[Responsory4]
R. Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.
* Because the hand of the Lord was with him, he smote the Philistine, and took away the reproach from Israel.
V. Is not this David? Did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
R. Because the hand of the Lord was with him, he smote the Philistine, and took away the reproach from Israel.

[Lectio5]
But in that wounds are healed by oil, it is clearly shown that the wounds of sin are to be wiped out. Let the head of the King be anointed then, that his mind may be filled with the spiritual grace of a teacher. Let him have oil through his anointing, let him have abundant mercy, which he should prefer to all other virtues. Let him have oil, so that while he kindles within himself the flame of the Holy Spirit, he may enlighten others by the Word. Likewise let him have the oil of healing, that he may dispense wisdom, and by it wipe out the stains of sins, and restore the sick in mind to health.

[Responsory5]
R. Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain upon you
* For there are the mighty of Israel fallen.
V. All ye mountains that stand round about, the Lord look upon you but let Him pass by Gilboa.
R. For there are the mighty of Israel fallen.

[Lectio6]
But Saul was anointed from a vial, not to signify teaching, but to indicate his future. For a vial is a very small vessel. Why was it that Saul was anointed from a vial of oil, if not because he was eventually to be cast out? For after he had refused to obey God, he heard from Samuel, because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he hath also rejected thee from being king. As the vial held but little oil, so he was to be cast away received but little spiritual grace. This may be taken to be the rulers of the holy Church. For many of them receive the high dignity of the prelacy who are not perfect in their love of God and of their neighbors.

[Responsory6]
R. Thus saith the Lord: I took thee out of thy father's house, and appointed thee to be ruler over My people, over Israel.
* And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, to establish thy kingdom for ever.
V. And I have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies.
R. And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, to establish thy kingdom for ever.
&Gloria
R. And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, to establish thy kingdom for ever.

[Lectio7]
From the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 15:1-5
At that time: the publicans and sinners drew near unto Jesus to hear him. And so on.
_
Homily by Pope St. Gregory (the Great.)
!34th on the Gospels.
Ye have heard, my brethren, from the Gospel which hath but now been read, how that the publicans and sinners drew near unto our Redeemer, and how that He received them, not only to converse, but also to eat with Him. And when the Pharisees and Scribes saw it, they murmured. From this learn ye, that true righteousness is merciful, and false righteousness is contemptuous, albeit that the righteous also oft-times feel moved with just indignation at sinners. But it is one thing to feel thus indignant through pride, and another to feel so through love of law.

[Responsory7]
@Tempora/Pent01-3:Responsory1

[Lectio8]
The righteous indeed look down upon sinners, and yet, as not despising them; they abandon them, and yet, as not without hope; they fight against them, and yet, as loving them all the while; for if they be behoven to chasten them grievously as touching the outer man, yet is it through charity which offereth sweetness to their inner man. In their hearts they prefer before themselves them whom they are correcting; they hold as better than themselves them whom they judge. And thus doing, they watch by carefulness over them, which are committed unto their charge, and, by lowly-mindedness, over themselves.

[Responsory8]
@Tempora/Pent01-0:Responsory8

[Lectio9]
On
the other hand, they whose exaltation cometh of a false righteousness, look down upon their neighbour, but are softened by no mercy toward his misery, and are all the more sinful, because they perceive not that they themselves are sinners. Of such were those Pharisees who judged the Lord because He received sinners, and, in the dryness of their own heart, rebuked the very Fountain of mercy. They were sick of so desperate a sickness that they knew not of themselves that they were sick; but, that they might know that they were so, the Heavenly Physician applied to them His tender ointments, and, by means of a gracious parable, lanced the boil of their pride of heart.

What man of you * that hath an hundred sheep, and if he shall lose one of them, doth he not leave the ninety-nine in the desert and go after that which was lost, until he find it? Alleluia.

[Versum 2]
V. The Lord reigneth; He is clothed with majesty.
R. The Lord is clothed with strength, and hath girded Himself with power.

[Ant 3]
What woman * having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it?

[Versum 3]
V. Let my prayer, O Lord, be set forth.
R. As incense before thee.
