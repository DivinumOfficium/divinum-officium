Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus
!Sir 7:1-5
1 Do no evils, and no evils shall lay hold of thee.
2 Depart from the unjust, and evils shall depart from thee.
3 My son, sow not evils in the furrows of injustice, and thou shalt not reap them sevenfold.
4 Seek not of the Lord a pre-eminence, nor of the king the seat of honour.
5 Justify not thyself before God, for he knoweth the heart: and desire not to appear wise before the king.

[Lectio2]
!Sir 7:6-10
6 Seek not to be made a judge, unless thou have strength enough to extirpate iniquities: lest thou fear the person of the powerful, and lay a stumblingblock for thy integrity.
7 Offend not against the multitude of a city, neither cast thyself in upon the people,
8 Nor bind sin to sin: for even in one thou shalt not be unpunished.
9 Be not fainthearted in thy mind:
10 Neglect not to pray, and to give alms.

[Lectio3]
!Sir 7:11-15
11 Say not: God will have respect to the multitude of my gifts, and when I offer to the most high God, he will accept my offerings.
12 Laugh no man to scorn in the bitterness of his soul: for there is one that humbleth and exalteth, God who seeth all.
13 Devise not a lie against thy brother: neither do the like against thy friend.
14 Be not willing to make any manner of lie: for the custom thereof is not good.
15 Be not full of words in a multitude of ancients, and repeat not the word in thy prayer.
