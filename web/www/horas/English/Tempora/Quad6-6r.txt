[Ant Vespera]
Today I am greatly afflicted, * but tomorrow I will break my bonds.;;115
With them * that hated peace I was peaceable: when I spoke to them they fought against me without cause.;;119
From unjust men * deliver me, O Lord.;;139
Keep me * from the snare, which they have laid for me, and from the stumbling-blocks of them that work iniquity.;;140
I looked * on my right hand, and beheld, and there was no one that would know me.;;141

[Ant 3]
The chief priests * and the Pharisees made the sepulcher sure, sealing the stone and setting guards.
