[Lectio1]
Lesson from the book of Job
!Job 7:1-4
1 The life of man upon earth is a warfare, and his days are like the days of a hireling.
2 As a servant longeth for the shade, as the hireling looketh for the end of his work;
3 So I also have had empty months, and have numbered to myself wearisome nights.
4 If I lie down to sleep, I shall say: When shall I arise? and again I shall look for the evening, and shall be filled with sorrows even till darkness.

[Lectio2]
!Job 7:5-8
5 My flesh is clothed with rottenness and the filth of dust, my skin is withered and drawn together.
6 My days have passed more swiftly than the web is cut by the weaver, and are consumed without any hope.
7 Remember that my life is but wind, and my eyes shall not return to see good things.
8 Nor shall the sight of man behold me: thy eyes are upon me, and I shall be no more.

[Lectio3]
!Job 7:9-12
9 As a cloud is consumed, and passeth away: so he that shall go down to hell shall not come up.
10 Nor shall he return any more into his house, neither shall his place know him any more.
11 Wherefore I will not spare my month, I will speak in the affliction of my spirit: I will talk with the bitterness of my soul.
12 Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou hast enclosed me in a prison?
