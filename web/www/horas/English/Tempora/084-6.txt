Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus
!Sir 4:23-28
23 Son, observe the time, and fly from evil.
24 For thy soul be not ashamed to say the truth.
25 For there is a shame that bringeth sin, and there is a shame that bringeth glory and grace.
26 Accept no person against thy own person, nor against thy soul a lie.
27 Reverence not thy neighbour in his fall:
28 And refrain not to speak in the time of salvation. Hide not thy wisdom in her beauty.

[Lectio2]
!Sir 4:29-32
29 For by the tongue wisdom is discerned: and understanding, and knowledge, and learning by the word of the wise, and steadfastness in the works of justice.
30 In nowise speak against the truth, but be ashamed of the lie of thy ignorance.
31 Be not ashamed to confess thy sins, but submit not thyself to every man for sin.
32 Resist not against the face of the mighty, and do not strive against the stream of the river

[Lectio3]
!Sir 4:33-36
33 Strive for justice for thy soul, and even unto death fight for justice, and God will overthrow thy enemies for thee.
34 Be not hasty in thy tongue: and slack and remiss in thy works.
35 Be not as a lion in thy house, terrifying them of thy household, and oppressing them that are under thee.
36 Let not thy hand be stretched out to receive, and shut when thou shouldst give.
