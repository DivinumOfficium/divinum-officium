Lesson from the book of Ezekiel
!Ezek 41:1-3
1 And he brought me into the temple, and he measured the fronts six cubits broad on this side, and six cubits on that side, the breadth of the tabernacle.
2 And the breadth of the gate was ten cubits: and the sides of the gate five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and he measured the length thereof forty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.
3 Then going inward he measured the front of the gate two cubits: and the gate six cubits, and the breadth of the gate seven cubits.

[Lectio2]
!Ezek 41:4-6
4 And he measured the length thereof twenty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits, before the face of the temple: and he said to me: This is the holy of holies.
5 And he measured the wall of the house six cubits: and the breadth of every side chamber four cubits round about the house on every side.
6 And the side chambers one by another, were twice thirty-three: and they bore outwards, that they might enter in through the wall of the house in the sides round about, to hold in, and not to touch the wall of the temple.

!Ezek 41:7-9
7 And there was a broad passage round about, going up by winding stairs, and it led into the upper loft of the temple all round: therefore was the temple broader in the higher parts: and so from the lower parts they went to the higher by the midst.
8 And I saw in the house the height round about, the foundations of the side chambers which were the measure of a reed the space of six cubits:
9 And the thickness of the wall for the side chamber without, which was five cubits: and the inner house was within the side chambers of the house.
