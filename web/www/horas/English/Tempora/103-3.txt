Lesson from the first book of Machabees
!1 Mac 12:39-43
39 Now when Tryphon had conceived a design to make himself king of Asia, and to take the crown, and to stretch out his hand against king Antiochus:
40 Fearing lest Jonathan would not suffer him, but would fight against him: he sought to seize upon him, and to kill him. So he rose up and came to Bethsan.
41 And Jonathan went out to meet him with forty thousand men chosen for battle, and came to Bethsan.
42 Now when Tryphon saw that Jonathan came with a great army, he durst not stretch forth his hand against him,
43 But received him with honour, and commended him to all his friends, and gave him presents: and he commanded his troops to obey him, as himself.

!1 Mac 12:44-47
44 And he said to Jonathan: Why hast thou troubled all the people, whereas we have no war?
45 Now therefore send them back to their own houses: and choose thee a few men that may be with thee, and come with me to Ptolemais, and I will deliver it to thee, and the rest of the strong holds, and the army, and all that have any charge, and I will return and go away: for this is the cause of my coming.
46 And Jonathan believed him, and did as he said: and sent away his army, and they departed into the land of Juda:
47 But he kept with him three thousand men: of whom he sent two thousand into Galilee, and one thousand went with him.

!1 Mac 12:48-52
48 Now as soon as Jonathan entered into Ptolemais, they of Ptolemais shut the gates of the city, and took him: and all them that came in with him they slew with the sword.
49 Then Tryphon sent an army and horsemen into Galilee, and into the great plain to destroy all Jonathan's company.
50 But they, when they understood that Jonathan and all that were with him were taken and slain, encouraged one another, and went out ready for battle.
51 Then they that had come after them, seeing that they stood for their lives, returned back.
52 Whereupon they all came peaceably into the land of Juda. And they bewailed Jonathan, and them that had been with him, exceedingly: and Israel mourned with great lamentation.
