v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 15:11-32
15:11 And he said: A certain man had two sons:
15:12 And the younger of them said to his father: Father, give me the portion of substance that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his substance.
15:13 And not many days after, the younger son, gathering all together, went abroad into a far country: and there wasted his substance, living riotously.
15:14 And after he had spent all, there came a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want.
15:15 And he went and cleaved to one of the citizens of that country. And he sent him into his farm to feed swine.
15:16 And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks the swine did eat; and no man gave unto him.
15:17 And returning to himself, he said: How many hired servants in my father's house abound with bread, and I here perish with hunger?
15:18 I will arise, and will go to my father, and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee:
15:19 I am not worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.
15:20 And rising up he came to his father. And when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and running to him fell upon his neck, and kissed him.
15:21 And the son said to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, I am not now worthy to be called thy son.
15:22 And the father said to his servants: Bring forth quickly the first robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:
15:23 And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat and make merry:
15:24 Because this my son was dead, and is come to life again: was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.
15:25 Now his elder son was in the field, and when he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing:
15:26 And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.
15:27 And he said to him: Thy brother is come, and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe.
15:28 And he was angry, and would not go in. His father therefore coming out began to entreat him.
15:29 And he answering, said to his father: Behold, for so many years do I serve thee, and I have never transgressed thy commandment, and yet thou hast never given me a kid to make merry with my friends:
15:30 But as soon as this thy son is come, who hath devoured his substance with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.
15:31 But he said to him: Son, thou art always with me, and all I have is thine.
15:32 But it was fit that we should make merry and be glad, for this thy brother was dead and is come to life again; he was lost, and is found.
