Homily of St Gregory Nazianzus
!2 
The Passover of the Lord, the Passover, and again, in honour of the Holy Trinity, I say the Passover. This is to us the festival of all festivals and the celebration of all celebrations, not only among the feasts that pertain to men and are established upon earth, but even among those that belong to Christ himself, and are celebrated to His glory, for this feast outshines all others, even as the sun out shines the stars. Yesterday the Lamb was slain and the door posts anointed, while Egypt bewailed her first born, but the Angel of death has passed us by, (for the sign was even to him a thing of terror and awe,) for we were protected by the Precious Blood.

[Lectio6]
Today we leave Egypt utterly behind us, and Pharaoh our cruel master, and his harsh officers; for we are delivered from the clay and the making of bricks. Nor is there any to forbid us to to celebrate it not with the leaven of our former malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth, bringing with us nothing of the unholy leaven of Egypt. Yesterday I shared his death, today I am made alive again with him, today with him I arise.

[Lectio7]
But let us offer gifts to Him who suffered and rose for us.  Do you perhaps think that I speak of gold or silver, or tapestries, or glittering stones of great price, the transient and perishable materials of the world which remain things of earth, and which, for the most part, the wicked and the slaves of earthly goods and the princes of the world usually possess? Rather, let us offer ourselves, that is, the dearest and most pleasing riches to God.  Let us return the glory of our image to the One whose image we are; let us recognise our dignity; let us follow our Exemplar in honour; let us understand the power of this mystery, and for what Christ suffered death. Let us be as Christ, for Christ is also as we. Let us become gods for His sake, for He also was made man for us.

[Lectio8]
Christ took what was lower, in order that he might give us the higher. He became poor that by his poverty we might be made rich. He took upon him the form of a servant, to set us at liberty. He stooped that we may be exalted. He was tempted, that we might overcome. He was despised, that he might bring us to glory. He died, to bring us to salvation. He ascended on high, to draw unto himself those who were sunk in sin. Let a man give all things to him who gave himself for us as the price of redemption and as the substitute for our guilt. Nothing so great, however, can be given in return, as the offering of ourselves, if we rightly understand this mystery, and if we do for his sake, become all things, whatsoever he for our sakes became.
