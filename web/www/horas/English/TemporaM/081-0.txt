20 Wisdom preacheth abroad, she uttereth her voice in the streets: 
21 At the head of multitudes she crieth out, in the entrance of the gates of the city she uttereth her words, saying:
22 O children, how long will you love childishness, and fools covet those things which are hurtful to themselves, and the unwise hate knowledge?
