[Lectio1]
From the letter of blessed Apostle James
!Jas 2:1-4
1 My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory with respect~
of persons. For if there shall come into your assembly a man having a golden~
ring, in fine apparel, and there shall come in also a poor man in mean attire,
3 And you have respect to him that is clothed with the fine apparel, and shall~
say to him: Sit thou here well; but say to the poor man: Stand thou there, or~
sit under my footstool:
4 Do you not judge within yourselves, and are become judges of unjust thoughts?

[Responsory1]
R. Bless ye God in the congregations Alleluia.
* Even the Lord, ye that are of the fountains of Israel Alleluia, Alleluia.
V. Sing forth the honour of His Name, make His praise glorious.
R. Even the Lord, ye that are of the fountains of Israel Alleluia, Alleluia.

!Jas 2:5-9
5 Hearken, my dearest brethren: hath not God chosen the poor in this world, rich~
in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which God hath promised to them that love~
him?
6 But you have dishonoured the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you by might?~
and do not they draw you before the judgment seats?
7 Do not they blaspheme the good name that is invoked upon you?
8 If then you fulfill the royal law, according to the scriptures, Thou shalt~
love thy neighbour as thyself; you do well.
9 But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin, being reproved by the law~
as transgressors.

[Responsory2]
R. With my whole heart Alleluia have I sought thee Alleluia.
* O let me not wander from thy commandments Alleluia, Alleluia.
V. Blessed art Thou, O Lord teach me thy statutes.
R. O let me not wander from thy commandments Alleluia, Alleluia.
&Gloria
R. O let me not wander from thy commandments Alleluia, Alleluia.

[Lectio3]
!Jas 2:10-13
10 And whosoever shall keep the whole law, but offend in one point, is become~
guilty of all.
11 For he that said, Thou shalt not commit adultery, said also, Thou shalt not~
kill. Now if thou do not commit adultery, but shalt kill, thou art become a~
transgressor of the law.
12 So speak ye, and so do, as men about to be judged by the law of liberty.
13 For judgment without mercy to him that hath not done mercy. And mercy~
exalteth itself above judgment

[Responsory3]
R. Sing us a song Alleluia.
* How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land Alleluia, Alleluia.
V. There they that carried us away captive required of us a song.
R. How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land Alleluia, Alleluia.
&Gloria
R. How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land Alleluia, Alleluia.

[Ant 2]
Peace be unto you, * it is I. Alleluia. Fear not. Alleluia.

[Ant 3]
When the Comforter, the Spirit of truth, is come, * He will reprove the world of~
sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment. Alleluia.~
