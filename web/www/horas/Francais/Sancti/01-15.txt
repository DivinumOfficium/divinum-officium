[Lectio4]
Paul the first hermit, and model of all others, was a native of the lower~
Theba'id in Egypt. At the age of fifteen years he lost both his parents. In~
order to escape from the persecution of Decius and Valerian, and to serve God in~
quietness, he betook himself to a cave in the desert. Here there was a palm-tree,~
on the fruit of which he lived, and of whose leaves he made his raiment until he~
attained the age of 113 years. At that time * Anthony, being now himself aged
90 years, received a command from God to go and see him. They met without~
knowing one another's names, and saluted one another, after which they fell~
straightway into a long discourse concerning the kingdom of God. Now it so~
happened that a raven had of a long time brought Paul every day half a loaf, but~
on this day while they spake together he brought a whole one.

[Lectio5]
When the raven had flown away Well, quoth Paul, the Lord hath sent us our~
dinner. Truly He is gracious; truly He is merciful. It is now sixty years that I~
have had half a loaf of bread every day, but now that thou art come, Christ~
giveth His soldiers double rations. Then they asked a blessing, and ate together,~
sitting by a spring. When they were refreshed, they returned thanks, as is the~
custom, and afterwards spent the whole night praising God. At break of day Paul~
felt the approach of death, and desired Anthony to bring the cloak which~
Athanasius had given him, to use for his winding-sheet. While Anthony was on his~
way back from this journey, he saw in a vision the soul of Paul ascending to~
heaven, surrounded by choirs of angels, and accompanied by the Prophets and~
Apostles.

[Lectio6]
When Anthony reached the cell of Paul, he found the dead body of the Saint in a~
kneeling posture, with the head thrown up and the hands stretched out towards~
heaven. He immediately began to chant the psalms and hymns ordained by Christian~
tradition, while he wrapped the body in the cloak of Athanasius. He had no spade~
to dig a grave, but two lions came roaring from the desert, as though to attend~
the burying, and scratched a hole big enough to hold a man's body, with their~
paws, showing meanwhile such signs of grief as their nature alloweth. When they~
were gone away, Anthony put the holy body in this hole, covered it with earth,~
and arranged it like a Christian's grave. He took away for himself Paul's tunic,~
which he had woven out of the palm-leaves somewhat after the manner of~
basket-work, and this tunic Anthony was in the habit of wearing on the great~
days of the Passover and Pentecost as long as he lived.

[Lectio93]
!Commemoration for St. Maur, Abbot.
Maurus was born of a noble Roman family, and while he was yet a child was~
offered to God by his father Eutychius, in the order and under the personal~
teaching of St. Benedict. In a short while he made such progress in the life of~
grace that he became a wonder to his master, who often held him up to his other~
disciples as a pattern of regular observance and all virtues. While he was yet~
very young, Pope St. Gregory telleth a wonderful instance of his obedience.~
Placid the monk having fallen into a lake where he was being swept away by the~
current, the holy Patriarch called Maurus and bade him run to the rescue, which~
he did, walking on the water till he reached Placid, whom he took by the hair of~
the head and dragged to the shore. He was sent by St. Benedict into France, where~
he founded the celebrated monastery (of Glanfeuil, now called St. Maur-sur-Loire,)~
which he governed for forty years. He was a zealous and successful propagator of~
monastic discipline. He passed to heaven, famous for holiness and miracles, when~
he was more than seventy years of age, in the year of Salvation 565.

[Lectio94]
Paul, originator and master of the eremitic life, was born in the lower~
Thebaid. When the Persecution of Decius and Valerian was raging, he withdrew to a~
cave in the desert. Here, with a palm tree providing him with both food and~
clothing; he lived a most holy life. He had reached the age of a hundred and~
thirteen years when Anthony, then ninety years old came to visit him. Paul~
received him warmly. After they had spent the night in conversing about holy~
things, Paul said that his death was at hand and asked Anthony to go and get the~
cloak given him by Athanasius to use as a winding sheet. Anthony went to do this~
and, as he was on his way back he saw Paul's soul going up to heaven. His body~
he found in his cell, still in the attitude of prayer. When he had chanted the~
customary hymns, he wrapped the body in the cloak, but had nothing to dig a~
grave with. Thereupon two lions came from deep in the desert and hollowed out a~
place large enough to hold a men's body. Anthony buried the body arranged the~
grave and went away taking with him the tunic which Paul had woven for himself~
from palm-leaves. Thereafter he always wore this cloak on the great feasts of~
Easter and Pentecost.
