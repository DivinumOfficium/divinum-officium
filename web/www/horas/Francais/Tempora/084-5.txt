Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus
!Sir 4:1-4
1 Son, defraud not the poor of alms, and turn not away thy eyes from the poor.
2 Despise not the hungry soul: and provoke not the poor in his want.
3 Afflict not the heart of the needy, and defer not to give to him that is in distress.
4 Reject not the petition of the afflicted: and turn not away thy face from the needy.

[Lectio2]
!Sir 4:5-7
5 Turn not away thy eyes from the poor for fear of anger: and leave not to them that ask of thee to curse thee behind thy back.
6 For the prayer of him that curseth thee in the bitterness of his soul, shall be heard, for he that made him will hear him.
7 Make thyself affable to the congregation of the poor, and humble thy soul to the ancient, and bow thy head to a great man

[Lectio3]
!Sir 4:8-11
8 Bow down thy ear cheerfully to the poor, and pay what thou owest, and answer him peaceable words with mildness.
9 Deliver him that suffereth wrong out of the hand of the proud: and be not fainthearted in thy soul.
10 In judging be merciful to the fatherless as a father, and as a husband to their mother.
11 And thou shalt be as the obedient son of the most High, and he will have mercy on thee more than a mother.
