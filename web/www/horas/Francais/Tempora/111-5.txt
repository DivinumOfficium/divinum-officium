[Lectio1]
Lesson from the book of Ezekiel
!Ezek 15:1-5
1 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
2 Son of man, what shall be made of the wood of the vine, out of all the trees of the woods that are among the trees of the forests?
3 Shall wood be taken of if, to do any work, or shall a pin be made of it for any vessel to hang thereon?
4 Behold it is cast into the fire for fuel: the fire hath consumed both ends thereof, and the midst thereof is reduced to ashes: shall it be useful for any work?
5 Even when it was whole it was not fit for work: how much less, when the fire hath devoured and consumed it, shall any work be made of it?

[Lectio2]
!Ezek 15:6-8
6 Therefore thus saith the Lord God: As the vine tree among the trees of the forests which I have given to the fire to be consumed, so will I deliver up the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
7 And I will set my face against them: they shall go out from fire, and fire shall consume them and you shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have set my face against them.
8 And I shall have made their land a wilderness, and desolate, because they have been transgressors, saith the Lord God.

!Ezek 16:1-5
1 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
2 Son of man, make known to Jerusalem her abominations.
3 And thou shalt say: Thus saith the Lord God to Jerusalem: thy root, and thy nativity is of the land of Chanaan, thy father was an Amorrhite, and thy mother a Cethite.
4 And when thou wast born, in the day of thy nativity thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed with water for thy health, nor salted with salt, nor swaddled with clouts.
5 No eye had pity on thee to do any of these things for thee, out of compassion to thee: but thou wast cast out upon the face of the earth in the abjection of thy soul, in the day that thou wast born.
