Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus
!Sir 10:1-5
1 A wise judge shall judge his people, and the government of a prudent man shall be steady.
2 As the judge of the people is himself, so also are his ministers: and what manner of man the ruler of a city is, such also are they that dwell therein.
3 An unwise king shall be the ruin of his people: and cities shall be inhabited through the prudence of the rulers.
4 The power of the earth is in the hand of God, and in his time he will raise up a profitable ruler over it.
5 The prosperity of man is in the hand of God, and upon the person of the scribe he shall lay his honour.

!Sir 10:6-10
 Remember not any injury done thee by thy neighbour, and do thou nothing by deeds of injury.
7 Pride is hateful before God and men: and all iniquity of nations is execrable.
8 A kingdom is translated from one people to another, because of injustices, and wrongs, and injuries, and diverse deceits.
9 But nothing is more wicked than the covetous man. Why is earth and ashes proud?
10 There is not a more wicked thing than to love money: for such a one setteth even his own soul to sale: because while he liveth he hath cast away his bowels.

!Sir 10:11-16
11 All power is of short life. A long sickness is troublesome to the physician.
12 The physician cutteth off it short sickness: so also a king is today, and tomorrow he shall die.
13 For when a man shall die, he shall inherit serpents, and beasts, and worms.
14 The beginning of the pride of man, is to fall off from God:
15 Because his heart is departed from him that made him: for pride is the beginning of all sin: be that holdeth it, shall be filled with maledictions, and it shall ruin him in the end.
16 Therefore hath the Lord disgraced the assemblies of the wicked, and hath utterly destroyed them.
