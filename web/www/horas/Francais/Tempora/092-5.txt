Lesson from the book of Job
!Job 40:1-5
1 And the Lord answering Job out of the whirlwind, said:
2 Gird up thy loins like a man I will ask thee, and do thou tell me.
3 Wilt thou make void my judgment and condemn me, that thou mayst be justified?
4 And hast thou an arm like God, and canst thou thunder with a voice like him?
5 Clothe thyself with beauty, and set thyself up on high and be glorious, and put on goodly garments.

!Job 40:6-11
6 Scatter the proud in thy indignation, and behold every arrogant man, and humble him.
7 Look on all that are proud, and confound them, and crush the wicked in their place.
8 Hide them in the dust together, and plunge their faces into the pit.
9 Then I will confess that thy right hand is able to save thee.
10 Behold behemoth whom I made with thee, he eateth grass like an ox.
11 His strength is in his loins, and his force in the navel of his belly.

!Job 42:1-6
1 Then Job answered the Lord, and said:
2 I know that thou canst do all things, and no thought is hid from thee.
3 Who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge? Therefore I have spoken unwisely, and things that above measure exceeded my knowledge.
4 Hear, and I will speak I will ask thee, and do thou tell me.
5 With the hearing of the ear, I have heard thee, but now my eye seeth thee.
6 Therefore I reprehend myself, and do penance in dust and ashes.
