Pomoz nám, Pane, v našich prosbách: abychom, když sami víme, že jsme vinni ve své nepravosti, na přímluvu svatého Chrysogona, tvého Mučedníka, jsme osvobozeni.

!Commemoration of S. Chrysogonus, Martyr
Chrysogonus was imprisoned at Rome in the reign of the Emperor Diocletian. There he lived for the space of two years upon the alms of the holy Anastasia. She was suffering much persecution from her husband Publius for Christ's Name's sake, and was used to write to Chrysogonus to ask for the help of his prayers, and he in return comforted her by his epistles. Presently the Emperor wrote to Rome commanding the rest of the Christians who were in prison there to be put to death, and Chrysogonus “to be sent to himself at Aquileia. When he was brought thither, he said unto him: I have sent for thee, O Chrysogonus, that I may increase thine honours, if only thou wilt bring thy mind to worship the gods.” Thereto Chrysogonus answered: “With my mind and with my prayers I worship Him Who is God indeed, but such gods as are nothing but images of devils, them I hate and curse.” Then was the Emperor kindled to fury at this answer, and commanded Chrysogonus to be beheaded at Aquae Gradatae upon the 24th day of November. His body was cast into the sea, but found a little while afterwards washed up upon the shore, and the Priest Zoilus took it and buried it in his own house.
