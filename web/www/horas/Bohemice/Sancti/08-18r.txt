!Commemoration of S. Agapitus, Martyr
Agapitus was a young man of Palestrina, who eagerly accepted martyrdom at the age of fifteen years, under the Emperor Aurelian. On account of his firmness in his religion, the Emperor ordered him first to receive an exceedingly long hiding with cat-gut, and then to be thrown into a foul dungeon, where he remained for four days without food. Being brought out of prison, live embers were put upon his head, but, whereas he still gave God thanks, he was whipped again, and hung up naked by the feet, in such wise that a thick smoke from a fire kindled under his face might pour into his mouth. Afterwards, boiling water was poured upon his belly, and his jaws were broken. Then presently the judge fell from his judgement seat, and shortly after died. Whereupon the Emperor was enraged, and commanded the holy youth to be thrown to wild beasts, but these dared not to touch him, and he was stricken by the sword at Palestrina.
