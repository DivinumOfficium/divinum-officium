[Ant Vespera] (rubrica cisterciensis)
Ejhle kněz veliký, * jenž za svých dnů zalíbil se Bohu, a shledán byl spravedlivým.
Hle, služebníku dobrý, * a v málu věrný, vstup do radosti svého Pána.
Je věrným a moudrým služebníkem, * jejž Pán ustanovil nad svou rodinou.
Blažený onen služebník, * až přijde jeho Pán, a zatluče na bránu, a nalezne jej bdícího.
Hle, pravý * Israelita, v němž není lsti.
