Lesson from the Acts of the Apostles
!Acts 3:1-6
1 Now Peter and John went up into the temple at the ninth hour of prayer.
2 And a certain man who was lame from his mother's womb, was carried: whom they laid every day at the gate of the temple, which is called Beautiful, that he might ask alms of them that went into the temple.
3 He, when he had seen Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked to receive an alms.
4 But Peter with John fastening his eyes upon him, said: Look upon us.
5 But he looked earnestly upon them, hoping that he should receive something of them.
6 But Peter said: Silver and gold I have none; but what I have, I give thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, arise, and walk.

13 The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus, whom you indeed delivered up and denied before the face of Pilate, when he judged he should be released.
14 But you denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you.
15 But the author of life you killed, whom God hath raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses.
16 And in the faith of his name, this man, whom you have seen and known, hath his name strengthened; and the faith which is by him, hath given this perfect soundness in the sight of you all.

[Ant 2]
Já jsem pravý vinný kmen, * alleluja; a vy jste pravé ratolesti, alleluja.

[Ant 2] (rubrica cisterciensis)
Vstal * Pán z hrobu, ten, který z nás visel na dřevě <i>kříže</i>, alleluja, alleluja, alleluja.

[Ant 3]
Protože jsi mě viděl, * Tomáši, uvěřil si; blažení, kteří neviděli, a přesto uvěřili, alleluja.

[Ant 3] (rubrica cisterciensis)
Anděl Páně totiž * sestoupil z nebe, přistoupil i odvalil kámen, a posadil se na něj, alleluja, alleluja.
