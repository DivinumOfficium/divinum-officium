/:De eerste strofe van de volgende hymne wordt geknield gebeden.:/
v. Daal neer, o Geest, die Schepper zijt,
Bezoek de zielen, U verpand;
Vervul met hemelse gena,
De harten die Gij 't aanschijn gaaft.
_
Gij, die de "Helper" wordt genoemd,
De gave van de hoogste God,
Levende bron, vuur, liefdevlam,
En geestelijke zielezalf.
_
Gij, zevenvoudig in uw gift,
Vinger van 's Vaders rechterhand,
Plechtig beloofd door 's Vaders woord!
Gij, die de tongen talen leert:
_
Ontsteek het licht in ons gemoed;
Stort liefde in onze harten uit:
De zwakheid van ons mens'lijk vlees
Met kracht versterkend immervoort.
_
Drijf ver van ons de vijand af,
Schenk vrede ons, die bestendig is;
Opdat wij zó, door U geleid,
Ontwijken al wat schaadlijk is.
_
Laat ons door U de Vader zien,
Door U erkennen ook de Zoon,
U, die de Geest van beiden zijt,
Gelovig volgen te allen tijd.

De Zoon, die uit het dodenrijk
Verrees, en ook de Middelaar,
Door aller eeuwen eeuwen heen.

Art with the Father and the Son,

With thy full flood of holiness.

Till others catch the living flame.

Through Jesus Christ, our Lord most High,
Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,
Doth live and reign eternally.

And banish every ill desire;
And while thou keep’st the body whole,
Shed forth thy peace upon the soul.

Who ever dost thyself unmoved abide,
Yet day by day the light in due gradation

An eve untouched by shadows of decay,
The brightness of a holy death-bed blending
With dawning glories of th’ eternal day.

And thou, O Christ, the co-eternal Word,
Who, with the Holy Ghost, by all things living
Now and to endless ages art adored.

Ver wijke dan elk droomgezicht,
Elk schrikbeeld door de nacht gesticht,
de macht des vijands zij geweerd,
zodat geen smet ons lichaam deert.
_
* Verleen dit, Vader, liefderijk,
Gij, Eengeboorne, Hem gelijk,
Gij Geest, die beider liefde zijt:
Regeer, Gij God, in eeuwigheid.
Amen.
