(Canticum Isaiae * Isa 26:1-12)
26:1 Sion the city of our strength a saviour, * a wall and a bulwark shall be set therein.
26:2 Open ye the gates, and let the just nation, * that keepeth the truth, enter in.
26:3 The old error is passed away: thou wilt keep peace: * peace, because we have hoped in thee.
26:4 You have hoped in the Lord for evermore, * in the Lord God mighty for ever.
26:5 For he shall bring down them that dwell on high, * the high city he shall lay low.
26:5 He shall bring it down even to the ground, * he shall pull it down even to the dust.
26:6 The foot shall tread it down, the feet of the poor, * the steps of the needy.
26:7 The way of the just is right, * the path of the just is right to walk in.
26:8 And in the way of thy judgments, O Lord, we have patiently waited for thee: * thy name, and thy remembrance are the desire of the soul.
26:9 My soul hath desired thee in the night: * yea, and with my spirit within me in the morning early I will watch to thee.
26:9 When thou shalt do thy judgments on the earth, * the inhabitants of the world shall learn justice.
26:10 Let us have pity on the wicked, but he will not learn justice: * in the land of the saints he hath done wicked things, and he shall not see the glory of the Lord.
26:11 Lord, let thy hand be exalted, and let them not see: * let the envious people see, and be confounded: and let fire devour thy enemies.
26:12 Lord, thou wilt give us peace: * for thou hast wrought all our works for us.
