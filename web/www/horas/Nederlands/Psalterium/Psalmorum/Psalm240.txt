(Canticum Isaiae * Isa 40:10-17)
40:10 Behold the Lord God shall come with strength, * and his arm shall rule:
40:10 Behold his reward is with him * and his work is before him.
40:11 He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather together the lambs with his arm, * and shall take them up in his bosom, and he himself shall carry them that are with young.
40:12 Who hath measured the waters * in the hollow of his hand, and weighed the heavens with his palm?
40:12 Who hath poised with three fingers the bulk of the earth, * and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?
40:13 Who hath forwarded the spirit of the Lord? * or who hath been his counsellor, and hath taught him?
40:14 With whom hath he consulted, and who hath instructed him, and taught him the path of justice, * and taught him knowledge, and shewed him the way of understanding?
40:15 Behold the Gentiles are as a drop of a bucket, * and are counted as the smallest grain of a balance.
40:16 Behold the islands are as a little dust. And Libanus shall not be enough to burn, * nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering.
40:17 All nations are before him as if they had no being at all, * and are counted to him as nothing, and vanity.
