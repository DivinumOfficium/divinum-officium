Lesson from the Acts of Apostles
!Acts 8:5-8
In those days, Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached the Christ to them. And the crowds with one accord gave heed to what was said by Philip, listening to him and seeing the miracles that he worked. For unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, went out of many possessed persons, and many paralytics and cripples were cured. So there was great joy in that city.

Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 9:1-6
At that time, having summoned the twelve apostles, Jesus gave them power and~
authority over all the devils, and to cure diseases. And He sent them forth to~
preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick. And he said to them, Take~
nothing for your journey, neither staff, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money;~
neither have two tunics. And whatever house you enter, stay there, and do not~
depart from thence. And whosoever will not receive you - go forth from that town, and shake off even the dust from your~
feet for a witness against them. And going forth, they went about from village~
to village, preaching the gospel and working cures everywhere.
