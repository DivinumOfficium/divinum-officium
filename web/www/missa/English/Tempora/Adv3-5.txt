[Lectio]
Lesson from the book of Isaias
!Isa 11:1-5
Thus says the Lord God: A shoot shall sprout from the stump of Jesse, and from his roots a bud shall blossom. The spirit of the Lord shall rest upon Him: a spirit of wisdom and of understanding, a spirit of knowledge and of piety, and His delight shall be the fear of the Lord. Not by appearance shall He judge, nor by hearsay shall He decide, but He shall judge the poor with justice, and decide aright for the land’s afflicted. He shall strike the ruthless with the rod of His mouth, and with the breath of His lips He shall slay the wicked. Justice shall be the band around His waist, and faithfulness a belt upon His hips.

[Graduale]
!Ps 84:8, 2
Show us, O Lord, Your kindness, and grant us Your salvation.
V. You have favored, O Lord, Your land; You have restored the well-being of~
Jacob.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 1:39-47
At that time, Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country, to a town of~
Juda. And she entered the house of Zachary and saluted Elizabeth. And it came to~
pass, when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, that the babe in her womb~
leapt. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit, and cried out with a loud~
voice, saying, Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your~
womb! And how have I deserved that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For~
behold, the moment that the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the babe in~
my womb leapt for joy. And blessed is she who has believed, because the things~
promised her by the Lord shall be accomplished. And Mary said, My soul magnifies~
the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour.

[Offertorium]
