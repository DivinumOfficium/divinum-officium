O God, protector of all who hope in You, without Whom nothing is strong, nothing~
is holy, increase Your mercy toward us, that, with Your guidance and direction~
we may so pass through the things of this temporal life as not to lose those of~
life eternal.

[Lectio]
Lesson from the first letter of St. Peter the Apostle
!1 Pet 5:6-11.
Beloved: Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in the time of visitation; cast all your anxiety upon Him, because He cares for you. Be sober, be watchful! For your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, goes about seeking someone to devour. Resist him, steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same suffering befalls your brethren all over the world. But the God of all grace, Who has called us unto His eternal glory in Christ Jesus, will Himself, after we have suffered a little while, perfect, strengthen and establish us. To Him is the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.

[Graduale]
!Ps. 54:23, 17, 19
Cast your care upon the Lord, and He will support you.
V. When I called upon the Lord, He heard my voice from those who war against me.~
Alleluia, alleluia.
!Ps 7:12
A just judge is God, strong and patient; is He angry every day?~
Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 15:1-10.
At that time, the publicans and sinners were drawing near to Him to listen to~
Him. And the Pharisees and the Scribes murmured, saying, This man welcomes~
sinners and eats with them. But He spoke to them this parable, saying, What man~
of you having a hundred sheep, and losing one of them, does not leave the~
ninety-nine in the desert, and go after that which is lost, until he finds it?~
And when he has found it, he lays it upon his shoulders rejoicing. And on coming~
home he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with~
me, because I have found my sheep that was lost.’ I say to you that, even so,~
there will be joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, more then over~
ninety-nine just who have no need of repentance. Or what woman, having ten~
drachmas, if she loses one drachma, does not light a lamp and sweep the house~
and search carefully until she finds it? And when she has found it, she calls~
together her friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found~
the drachma that I had lost.’ Even so, I say to you, there will be joy among the~
angels of God over one sinner who repents.

[Offertorium]
!Ps. 9:11-13.
They trust in You who cherish Your name, O Lord, for You forsake not those who~
seek You. Sing praise to the Lord enthroned in Sion, for He has not forgotten~
the cry of the afflicted.

[Secreta]
Look favorably, O Lord, upon the offerings of Your prayerful Church and grant~
that those who believe may, in continual holiness, partake of them for their~
salvation.

[Communio]
!Luke 15:10.
I say to you: there is joy among the angels of God over one sinner who repents.

[Postcommunio]
May the holy things of which we have partaken bring us to life and prepare for~
Your everlasting mercy those whom You have cleansed from sin.
