!!Lectiones
! None being ended, the priest and his ministers, in black vestments, proceed without lights or incense to the altar and, prostrate before it, pray for a few moments. Meanwhile the acolytes spread a single cloth upon the altar. The priest, having finished his prayer, proceeds to the steps, with his ministers. The celebrant kisses the altar in the middle and goes to the epistle side. Then a reader reads the prophecy, and begins without any title or introduction.
!Osee 6. 1-6
! (The infinite mercies of God are about to be poured down on the Christians, doing penance.) 
Thus saith the Lord: In their affliction they will rise early to Me: Come, and let us return to the Lord, for He hath taken us, and He will heal us, He will strike, and He will cure us. He will revive us after two days: on the third day He will raise us up and we shall live in His sight. We shall know and we shall follow on, that we may know the Lord. His going forth is prepared as the morning light and He will come to us as the early and the latter rain to the earth. What shall I do to thee, O Ephraim? What shall I do to thee, O Juda? Your mercy is as a morning cloud and as the dew that goeth away in the morning. For this reason have I hewed them by the Prophets, I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgements shall go forth as the light. For I desired mercy and not sacrifice: and the knowledge of God more than holocausts.

O God, from whom Judas received the punishment of his guilt, and the thief the reward of his confession: grant unto us the full fruit of Thy clemency; that even as in His Passion, our Lord Jesus Christ gave to each a retribution according to his merits, so having taken away our old sins, He may bestow upon us the grace of His Resurrection. Who with Thee liveth and reigneth in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God, world without end.

! The subdeacon sings the following Lesson, without any introductory title, in the tone for the Epistle.
!Exodus 12. 1-11
! The children of Israel are to sacrifice the Paschal Lamb; the Israelites will put the Lamb of God to death on the Cross.
In those days the Lord said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt: This month shall be to you the beginning of months: it shall be the first in the months of the year. Speak ye to the whole assembly of the children of Israel, and say to them: On the tenth day fo this month let every man take a lamb by their families and houses. But if the number be less than may suffice to eat the lamb, be shall take unto him his neighbor that joineth to his house, according to the number of souls which may be enough to eat the lamb. And it shall be a lamb without blemish, a male, of one year: according to which rite also you shall take a kid. And you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month: and the whole multitude of the children of Israel shall sacrifice it in the evening. And they shall take of blood thereof, and put it upon both the side posts, and on the upper door posts of the houses, wherein they shall eat it. And they shall eat the flesh that night roasted at the fire: and unleavened bread with wild lettuce. You shall not eat thereof any thing raw, nor boiled in water, but only roasted at the fire. You shall eat the head with the feet and entrails thereof. Neither shall there remain any thing of it until morning. If there be an thing left, you shall burn it with fire. And thus you shall eat it: You shall gird your reins, and you shall have shoes on your feet, holding staves in your hands, and you shall eat in haste; for it is the Phase that is the Passage of the Lord.

!Ps 139:2-10, 14
v. Deliver me, O Lord, from the evil man: rescue me from the unjust man. 
V. Who have devised iniquities in their hearts: all the day long they designed battles. 
V. They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; the venom of asps is under their lips. 
V. Keep me, O Lord, from the hand of the wicked: and from unjust men deliver me. 
V. Who have proposed to supplant my steps. The proud have hidden a net for me. 
V. And tehy have stretched out cords for a snare for my feet; they have laid for me a stumbling-block by the wayside. 
V. I said to the Lord: Thou art my God. Hear, O Lord, the voice of my supplication.
V. O Lord, Lord, the strength of my salvation: overshadow my head in the day of battle. 
V. Give me not up from my desire to the wicked: they have plotted against me. Do not Thou forsake me, lest at any time they should triumph.

! After the Tract the Passion is sung from bare lecterns, while the officiating priest reads it in a low voice at the epistle side.
!!PASSION 
The Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ according to St. John.
!John 18:1-40; 19:1-42
v. At that time Jesus went forth with His disciples over the brook Cedron, where there was a garden, into which He entered with His disciples. And Judas also, who betrayed Him, knew the place: because Jesus had often resorted thither together with His disciples. Judas therefore having received a band of soldiers and servants fro the chief priests and the Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons. Jesus therefore, knowing that all things that should come upon Him, went forth and said to them: J. Whom seek ye? C. They answered Him: S. Jesus of Nazareth. C. Jesus saith to them: J. I am He. C. And Judas also, who betrayed Him, stood with them. As soon therefore as He had said to them: J. I am He; they went backward and fell to the ground. Again therefore He asked them: J. Whom seek ye? C. And they said: S. Jesus of Nazareth. C. Jesus answered: J. I have told you that I am He. If therefore you seek Me, let these go their way; C. That the word might be fulfilled which He said: Of them whom Thou hast given Me, I have not lost anyone. Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear. And the name of the servant was Malchus. Jesus therefore said to Peter: J. Put up thy sword in the scabbard. The chalice which My Father hath given Me, shall I not drink it? C. Then the band and the tribune and the servants of the Jews took Jesus, and bound Him. And they led Him away to Annas first, for he was father-in-law to Caiphas, who was the high priest that year.	  Now Caiphas was he who had given the counsel to the Jews: that it was expedient that one man should die for the people. And Simon Peter followed Jesus: and so did another disciple. And that disciple was known to the high priest and went in with Jesus into the court of the high priest. But Peter stood at the door without. The other disciple therefore, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the portress and brought in Peter. The maid therefore that was portress saith to Peter: S. Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? C. He saith: S. I am not. C. Now the servants and ministers stood at a fire of coals, because it was cold, and warmed themselves. And with them was Peter, also, standing and warming himself. The high priest therefore asked Jesus of His disciples and of His doctrine. Jesus answered him: J. I have spoken openly to the world. I have always taught in the synagogue and in the temple, whither all the Jews resort: and in secret I have spoken nothing. Why asketh thou Me? Ask them who have heard what I have spoken unto them. Behold they know what things I have said. C. And when He had said these things, one of the servants, standing by, gave Jesus a blow, saying: S. Answerest Thou the high priest so? C. Jesus answered him: J. If I have spoken evil, give testimony of the evil; but if well, why strikest thou Me? C. And Annas sent Him bound to Caiphas the high priest. And Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore to him: S. Art not thou also one of His disciples? C. He denied it and said: S. I am not. C. One of the servants of the high priest a kinsman to him whose ear Peter cut off saith to him: S. Did I not see thee in the garden with Him? C. Again therefore Peter denied; and immediately the cock crew. Then they led Jesus from Caiphas to the governor's hall. And it was morning; and they went not into the hall, that they might not be defiled, but that they might eat the Pasch. Pilate therefore went out to them, and said: S. What accusation bring you against this man? C. They answered and said to him: S. If He were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered Him up to thee. C. Pilate therefore said to them: S. Take Him you, and judge Him according to your law. C. The Jews therefore said to him: S. It is not lawful for us to put any man to death. C. That the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which He said, signifying what death He should die. Pilate therefore went into the hall again and called Jesus and said to Him: S. Art Thou the King of the Jews? C. Jesus answered: J. Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or have other told it thee of Me? C. Pilate answered: S. Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered Thee up to me. What hast Thou done? C. Jesus answered: J. My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, My servants would certainly strive that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now My kingdom is not from hence. C. Pilate therefore said to Him: S. Art Thou a King then? C. Jesus answered: J. Thou sayest I am a king. For this was I born, and for this came I into the world; that I should give testimony of the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth My voice. C. Pilate saith to Him: S. What is truth? C. And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews and saith to them: S. I find no cause in Him. But you have a custom that I should release one unto you at the Pasch. Will you, therefore, that I release unto you the King of the Jews? C. Then cried they all again, saying: S. Not this man, but Barabbas. C. Now Barabbas was a robber. Then therefore Pilate took Jesus and scourged Him. And the soldiers platting a crown of thorns, put it upon His head; and they put on Him a purple garment. And they came to Him and said: S. Hail, King of the Jews. C. And they gave Him blows. Pilate therefore went forth again and saith to them: S. Behold, I bring Him forth unto you, that you may know that I find no cause in Him. C. Jesus therefore came forth, bearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. And he saith to them: S. Behold the man. C. When the chief priests, therefore, and the servants had seen Him, they cried out, saying: S. Crucify Him, crucify Him. C. Pilate saith to them: S. Take Him you, and crucify Him; for I find no cause in Him. C. The Jews answered him: S. We have a law, and according to the law He ought to die, because He made Himself the Son of God. C. When Pilate, therefore, had heard this saying, he feared the more. And he entered into the hall again; and he said to Jesus: S. Whence art Thou? C. But Jesus gave him no answer. Pilate therefore saith to Him: S. Speakest Thou not to me? Knowest Thou not that I have power to crucify Thee, and I have power to release Thee? C. Jesus answered: J. Thou shouldst not have any power against Me, unless it were given thee from above. Therefore, he that hath delivered Me to thee hath a greater sin. C. And from henceforth Pilate sought to release Him. But the Jews cried out, saying: S. If thou release this Man, thou art not Caesar's friend. For whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar. C. Now when Pilate had heard these words, he brought Jesus forth and sat down in the judgment seat, in the place that is called Lithostrotos, and in Hebrew Gabbatha. And it was Parasceve of the Pasch, about the sixth hour; and he saith to the Jews: S. Behold your King. C. But they cried out: S. Away with Him. Away with Him: Crucify Him. C. Pilate saith to them: S. Shall I crucify your King? C. The chief priests answered: S. We have no king but Caesar. C. Then, therefore, he delivered Him to them to be crucified. And they took Jesus and led Him forth. And bearing His cross, He went forth to that place which is called Calvary but in Hebrew Golgotha.; where they crucified Him, and with Him two others, one on each side and Jesus in the midst. And Pilate wrote a title also: and he put it upon the cross. And the writing was: Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews. This title therefore many of the Jews did read: because the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city. And it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and in Latin. Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate: S. Write not: The King of the Jews; but that He said: I am the King of the Jews. C. Pilate answered: S. What I have written, I have written. C. The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Him, took His garments and they made four parts, to every soldier a part and also His coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout. They said then one to another: S. Let us not cut it, but let us cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the Scripture might be fulfilled which saith: They have parted My garemnts among them, and upon My vesture they have cast lots. And the soldiers indeed did these things. Now there stood by the cross of Jesus His Mother, and His Mother's sister, Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalen. When Jesus therefore had seen His Mother and the disciple standing whom He loved, He saith to His Mother: J. Woman, behold thy son. C. After that, He saith to the disciple: J. Behold thy mother. C. And from that hour, the disciple took her to his own. Afterwards, Jesus, knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said: J. I thirst. C. Now there was a vessel set there, full of vinegar. And they, putting a sponge full of vinegar about hyssop, put it to His mouth. Jesus therefore, when He had taken the vinegar, said: J. It is consummated. C. And bowing His head, He gave up the ghost.
_
!Here all kneel and pause a few moments.
Then the Jews because it was the Parasceve, that the bodies might not remain upon the cross on the Sabbath day for that was a great Sabbath day, besought Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away. The soldiers therefore came, and they broke the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with Him. But after they were come to Jesus, when they saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs. But one of the soldiers with a spear opened His side, and immediately there came out blood and water. And he that saw it hath given testimony: and his testimony is true. And he knoweth that he saith true: that you also may believe. For these things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled: you shall not break a bone of Him. And again another Scripture saith: They shall look on Him whom they pierced.
_
!  Here Munda cor meum is said, but the deacon does not ask the priest's blessing. The lights are not carried; nor does the celebrant kiss the book at the end. The following is sung in the gospel tone:
v. Cleanse my heart and my lips, O almighty God, who didst cleanse the lips of the prophet Isaias with a burning coal, and vouchsafe, through Thy gracious mercy, so to purify me, that I may worthily announce Thy holy Gospel. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.
v. Give me Thy blessing, O Lord. The Lord be in my heart and on my lips, that I may worthily and in a becoming manner, proclaim His holy Gospel. Amen.
P. The Lord be with you.
S. And with thy spirit. 
v. And after these things, Joseph of Arimathea because he was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews besought Pilate that he might take away the Body of Jesus. And Pilate gave leave. He came therefore and took away the Body of Jesus. And Nicodemus also came he who at the first came to Jesus by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pound weight. They took therefore the Body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths, with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury. Now there was in the place where He was crucified a garden: and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein no man yet had been laid. There, therefore, because of the Parasceve of the Jews, they laid Jesus, because the sepulchre was nigh at hand.

!!THE GREAT INTERCESSIONS

!!Adoration of the Cross
! After these Collects, the priest lays aside his chasuble and goes to the epistle corner of the altar, where at the back angle he receives from the deacon the veiled Cross, which has been previously arranged on the altar. Then turning towards the people, he uncovers first the upper portion of the veiled Cross and intones the verse:
V. Behold the wood of the Cross, on which hung the Saviour of the world.
R. Come, let us adore.
! When the choir sings these words, all kneel, except the celebrant. The priest then advances to the front corner, and uncovers the right arm; elevating the Crucifix a little, he sings on a higher tone than before:
V. Behold the wood of the Cross, on which hung the Saviour of the world.
R. Come, let us adore.
!  Then at the middle of the altar the Celebrant uncovers the whole Cross, and, lifting it up, begins still higher, the ministers and choir continuing as before:
V. Behold the wood of the Cross, on which hung the Saviour of the world.
R. Come, let us adore.
!  The celebrant carries the Cross to the place prepared for it in front of the altar, and kneeling, lays it on a cushion. After which he takes off his shoes and chasuble. Then the priest, his ministers, and the rest of the clergy, and the laity kneel thrice and adore the Cross in turn. During the adoration of the Cross, the Improperia or Reproaches are sung, while the priest, sitting, recites them with his ministers.
_
!REPROACHES
! Two cantors sing the following:
V. O my people, what have I done to thee? or wherein have I afflicted thee? Answer me.

!CRUX FIDELIS
! Afterwards the hymn Pange lingua lauream is sung in the following manner with the Crux fidelis.
Ant. Faithful Cross! above all other, One and only noble Tree! None in foliage, none in blossom, None in fruit thy peer may be; * Sweetest wood and sweetest iron, Sweetest weight is hung on thee.
v. Sing, my tongue, the glorious battle! 
With completed victory rife! 
And above the Cross's trophy 
Tell the triumph of the strife: 
How the world's Redeemer conquer'd 
By the offering of His life.
_ `
Ant. Faithful Cross! above all other, One and only noble Tree! None in foliage, none in blossom, None in fruit thy peer may be.
v. God, his Maker, sorely grieving, 
That the first-made Adam fell, 
When he ate the fruit of sorow, 
Whose reward was death and hell, 
Noted then this Wood the ruin, 
Of the ancient wood to quell.
_ `
Ant. Sweetest wood and sweetest iron, Sweetest weight is hung on thee.
v. For this work of our salvation 
Needs must have its order so, 
And the manifold deceiver's 
Art by art would overthrow, 
And from thence would bring the healing, 
Whence the insult of the foe.
_ `
Ant. Faithful Cross! above all other, One and only noble Tree! None in foliage, none in blossom, None in fruit thy peer may be.
v. Wherefore when the appointed fullness 
Of the holy time was come, 
He was sent who maketh all things 
From th' eternal Father's home, 
And proceeded, God Incarnate, 
Offspring of the Virgin's womb.
_ `
Ant. Sweetest wood and sweetest iron, Sweetest weight is hung on thee.
v. Weeps the Infant in the manger 
That in Bethlehem's stable stands: 
And His Limbs the Virgin Mother 
Doth compose in swaddling bands, 
Meetly thus in linen folding 
Of her God the feet and hands.
_ `
Ant. Faithful Cross! above all other, One and only noble Tree! None in foliage, none in blossom, None in fruit thy peer may be.
v. Thirty years among us dwelling,

For that this He freely willed:
On the Cross the Lamb is lifted, 
Where His life-blood shall be spilled.
_ `
Ant. Sweetest wood and sweetest iron, Sweetest weight is hung on thee.
v. He endured the nails, the spitting, 
Vinegar, and spear, and reed; 
From that holy Body broken 
Blood and water forth proceed: 
Earth, and stars, and sky, and ocean, 
By that flood from stain are freed.
_ `
Ant. Faithful Cross! above all other, One and only noble Tree! None in foliage, none in blossom, None in fruit thy peer may be.
v. Bend thy boughs, O Tree of glory!

And the King of heavenly beauty 
On thy bosom gently tend!
_ `
Ant. Sweetest wood and sweetest iron, Sweetest weight is hung on thee.
v. Thou alone wast counted worthy 
This world's ransom to uphold; 
For a shipwrecked race preparing 
Harbor, like the Ark of old; 
With the sacred Blood anointed 
From the smitten Lamb that rolled.

Ant. Faithful Cross! above all other, One and only noble Tree! None in foliage, none in blossom, None in fruit thy peer may be.

Trinal Unity, Whose praises 
All created things repeat.  
Amen.
Ant. Sweetest wood and sweetest iron, Sweetest weight is hung on thee.

When the adoration of the Cross is ended, the candles are lighted on the altar; and the Cross having been replaced, a procession to the Altar of Repose takes place; the celebrant and his ministers with the clergy go to the place where the Blessed Sacrament has reposed since the previous day. The Sacred Host is incensed and then It is taken from the tabernacle and is solemnly borne back to the High Altar. During the procession is sung the:
_
_
!VEXILLA REGIS
The royal banners forward go 
The Cross shines forth in mystic glow, 
Where life Himself our death endured, 
And by His death our life procured.
_ `
Where deep for us the spear was dyed, 
Life's torrent rushing from His side, 
To wash us in that precious flood, 
Where mingled water flowed, and blood.
_ `
Fulfill'd is all that David told
In true prophetic song of old 
To all the nations: "God," saith he, 
"Hath reigned and triumphed from the Tree."
_ `
O Tree of beauty, Tree of light, 
O Tree with royal purple dight, 
Elect on whose triumphal breast 
These holy limbs shouldst find their rest;
_ `
On whose dear arms, so widely flung, 
The weight of this world's ransom hung; 
The price of human kind to pay,
And spoil the spoiler of his prey.
_ `
O Cross, our one reliance, hail! 
This holy Passiontide avail 
To give new virtue to the saint, 
And pardon to the penitent.
_ `
To Thee, eternal Three in One, 
Let homage meet by all be done;
As by the Cross Thou dost restore,
So rule and guide us evermore.  
Amen.

!!Communion
! Having arrived at the altar, the priest incenses the Blessed Sacrament, places the Host on the corporal, and, having received wine and water, he incenses again the oblation and the altar as at High Mass, saying:
v. May this incense, + which Thou hast blessed, O Lord, ascend to Thee, and may Thy mercy descend upon us.
! Then he incenses the altar, saying:
v. Let my prayer, O Lord, be directed as incense in Thy sight: the lifting up of my hands as an evening sacrifice. Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth, and a door round about my lips. May my heart not incline to evil words, to make excuses for sins.
! Giving the censer to the deacon, he says:
v. May the Lord enkindle within us the fire of His love, and the flame of everlasting charity. Amen.
! The priest is not incensed.
_
! The priest, having washed his hands in silence, bows down before the altar and says:
v. Accept, O Lord, in the spirit of humility and contrition of heart, and grant that this sacrifice which we offer this day in Thy sight may be pleasing to Thee, O Lord God.
_
! He now turns to the people, saying the Orate Fratres, as usual:
v. Brethren, pray that my Sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the Father almighty.
! No answer is made, but the priest immediately sings:
_
_
v. Let us pray. 
Instructed by Thy saving precepts, and following Thy divine institution, we are bold to say:
v. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy Name; Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation. 
! The choir answers:
R. But deliver us from evil.
! The priest subjoins 
P. Amen 
! in a low voice, and continues aloud:
_
v. Deliver us, we beseech Thee, O Lord, from all evils, past, present, and to come; and by the intercession of the blessed and glorious ever Virgin Mary, Mother of God, and of the Holy Apostles, Peter and Paul, and of Andrew, and of all the Saints, mercifully grant peace in our days, that through the assistance of Thy mercy we may be always free from sin, and secure from all disturbance. Through the same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who with Thee in the unity of the Holy Ghost liveth and reigneth God, world without end.
C. Amen.
_
! The Host is then elevated, and the priest continues with the following prayer:
v. Let not the partaking of Thy Body, O Lord Jesus Christ, which I, though unworthy, presume to receive, turn to my judgment and condemnation; but let it, through Thy mercy, become a safeguard and remedy, both for soul and body; Who with God the Father, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, livest and reignest God, for ever and ever. Amen.
v. I will take the Bread of heaven, and will call upon the Name of the Lord.
! He says three times devoutly and humbly:
v. Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldst enter under my roof; say but the word, and my soul shall be healed.
v. Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldst enter under my roof; say but the word, and my soul shall be healed.
v. Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldst enter under my roof; say but the word, and my soul shall be healed.
! Then, with his right hand making the Sign of the Cross with the Host over the paten, he says:
v. May the body of our Lord Jesus Christ preserve my soul unto life everlasting. Amen.
! He receives the Sacred Host and drinks from the chalice the wine with the consecrated particle, and having received the ablution, with bowed head and hands joined, he says:
v. Grant, O Lord, that what we have taken with our mouth, we may receive with a pure mind; and from a temporal gift may it become to us an eternal remedy.
! Then the priest and his ministers, having bowed before the altar, depart in silence.
