[Lectio]
Lesson from the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians
!Eph 4:23-28
Brethren: Be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put on the new man, which has been created according to God in justice and holiness of truth. Wherefore, put away lying and speak truth each one with his neighbor, because we are members of one another. Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down upon your anger; do not give place to the devil. He who was wont to steal, let him steal no longer; but rather let him labor, working with his hands at what is good, that he may have something to share with him who suffers need.

[Graduale]
!Ps 140:2
Let my prayer come like incense before You, O Lord.
V. The lifting up of my hands, like the evening sacrifice. Alleluia, alleluia.
!Ps 104:1
V. Give thanks to the Lord, invoke His name; make known among the nations His~
deeds. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 22:1-14
 At that time, Jesus spoke to the chief priests and the Pharisees in parables,~
saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a king who made a marriage feast for his~
son. And he sent his servants to call in those invited to the marriage feast,~
but they would not come. Again he sent out other servants, saying, "Tell those~
who are invited, behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fatlings are~
killed, and everything is ready; come to the marriage feast." But they made~
light of it, and went off, one to his farm, and another to his business; and the~
rest laid hold of his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them. But~
when the king heard of it, he was angry; and he sent his armies, destroyed those~
murderers, and burnt their city. Then he said to his servants, "The marriage~
feast indeed is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy; go therefore~
to the crossroads, and invite to the marriage feast whomever you shall find."~
And his servants went out into the roads, and gathered all whom they found, both~
good and bad; and the marriage feast was filled with guests. Now the king went~
in to see the guests, and he saw there a man who had not on a wedding garment.~
And he said to him, "Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding~
garment?" But he was speechless. Then the king said to the attendants, "Bind his~
hands and feet and cast him forth into the darkness outside, where there will be~
the weeping and the gnashing of teeth." For many are called, but few are chosen.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 137:7
Though I walk amid distress, You preserve me, O Lord; against the anger of my~
enemies You raise Your hand; Your right hand saves me.

[Secreta]
Grant, we beseech You, O Lord, that these gifts which we offer in the sight of~
Your majesty, may be the means of our salvation.
