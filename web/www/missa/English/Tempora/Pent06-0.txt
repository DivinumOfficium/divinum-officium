[Lectio]
Lesson from the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans
!Rom 6:3-11.
Brethren: All we who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death. For we were buried with Him by means of Baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ has arisen from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also may walk in newness of life. For if we have been united with Him in the likeness of His death, we shall be so in the likeness of His resurrection also. For we know that our old self has been crucified with Him, in order that the body of sin may be destroyed, that we may no longer be slaves to sin; for he who is dead is acquitted of sin. But if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live together with Christ; for we know that Christ, having risen from the dead, dies now no more, death shall no longer have dominion over Him. For the death that He died, He died to sin once for all, but the life that He lives, He lives unto God. Thus do you consider yourselves also as dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

[Graduale]
!Ps. 89:13, 1
Return, O Lord! How long? Have pity on Your servants!
V. O Lord, You have been our refuge through all generations. Alleluia, alleluia.
!Ps. 30:2-3.
V. In You, O Lord, I take refuge; let me never be put to shame. In~
Your justice rescue me and release me, incline Your ear to me, make haste to~
deliver me! Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Mark
!Mark 8:1-9
At that time, when there was a great crowd with Jesus, and they had nothing to~
eat, He called His disciples together and said to them, I have compassion on the~
crowd, for behold, they have now been with Me three days, and have nothing to~
eat; and if I send them away to their homes fasting, they will faint on the way,~
for some of them have come from a distance. And His disciples answered Him, How~
will anyone be able to satisfy these with bread, here in a desert? And He asked~
them, How many loaves have you? And they said, Seven. And He bade the crowd~
recline on the ground. Then taking the seven loaves, He gave thanks, broke them~
and gave them to His disciples to distribute; and they set them before the~
crowd. And they had a few little fishes; and He blessed them, and ordered them~
to be distributed. And they ate and were satisfied; and they took up what was~
left of the fragments, seven baskets. Now those who had eaten were about four~
thousand. And He dismissed them.

[Offertorium]
!Ps. 16:5-7
Make my steps steadfast in Your paths, that my feet may not falter. Incline Your~
ear to me; hear my word. Show Your wondrous kindness, O Lord, O Saviour of those~
who trust in You.

[Secreta]
Mercifully hear our humble prayers, O Lord, and graciously accept these~
offerings of Your people, and grant that no prayer may be without effect, no~
petition in vain, so that what we ask in faith, we may really obtain.
