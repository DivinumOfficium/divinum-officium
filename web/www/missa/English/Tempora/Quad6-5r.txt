[Prelude]
! The sacred ministers, wearing black stoles, come to the altar, lie prostrate before it, and pray silently for a few moments.  A signal is given; whereupon all kneel upright except the celebrant who stands facing the altar steps and sings in the ferial tone:
v. O God who, by the Passion of Thy Christ, our Lord, hast loosened the bonds of death, that heritage of the first sin to which all men of later times did succeed: make us so conformed to Him that, as we must needs have bourne the likeness of earthly nature, so we may by santification bear the likeness of heavenly grace.  Through the same Christ our Lord.  R.  Amen.

!PROPHECY 
!Osee 6:1-6
~(The infinite mercies of God are about to be poured down on the Christians, doing penance.)
Thus saith the Lord: In their affliction they will rise early to Me: Come, and let us return to the Lord, for He hath taken us, and He will heal us, He will strike, and He will cure us.  He will revive us after two days: on the third day He will raise us up and we shall live in His sight.  We shall know and we shall follow on, that we may know the Lord.  His going forth is prepared as the morning light and He will come to us as the early and the latter rain to the earth.  What shall I do to thee, O Ephraim?  What shall I do to thee, O Juda?  Your mercy is as a morning cloud and as the dew that goeth away in the morning.  For this reason have I hewed them by the Prophets, I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgements shall go forth as the light.  For I desired mercy and not sacrifice: and the knowledge of God more than holocausts.
_ 
!Tract
v. O Lord, I have heard Thy hearing and was afraid: I have considered Thy works and trembled.  
V. In the midst of two animals Thou shalt be made known: when the years shall draw nigh Thou shalt be known: when the time shall come, Thou shalt be manifested.  
V. When my soul shall be in trouble, Thou wilt remember mercy, even in Thy wrath.  
V. God will come from Libanus, and the Holy One from the shady and thickly covered mountain.  
V. His majesty covered the heavens: and the earth is full of His praise.
_
!Prayer
v. Let us pray.
D. Let us kneel.
R. Arise.
O God, from whom Judas received the punishment of his guilt, and the thief the reward of his confession: grant unto us the full fruit of Thy clemency; that even as in His Passion, our Lord Jesus Christ gave to each a retribution according to his merits, so having taken away our old sins, He may bestow upon us the grace of His Resurrection.

!Lesson 
!Exod 12:1-11
~(The children of Israel are to sacrifice the Paschal Lamb; the Israelites will put the Lamb of God to death on the Cross.)
In those days the Lord said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt: This month shall be to you the beginning of months: it shall be the first in the months of the year.  Speak ye to the whole assembly of the children of Israel, and say to them: On the tenth day fo this month let every man take a lamb by their families and houses.  But if the number be less than may suffice to eat the lamb, he shall take unto him his neighbor that joineth to his house, according to the number of souls which may be enough to eat the lamb.  And it shall be a lamb without blemish, a male, of one year: according to which rite also you shall take a kid.  And you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month: and the whole multitude of the children of Israel shall sacrifice it in the evening.  And they shall take of blood thereof, and put it upon both the side posts, and on the upper door posts of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.  And they shall eat the flesh that night roasted at the fire: and unleavened bread with wild lettuce.  You shall not eat thereof any thing raw, nor boiled in water, but only roasted at the fire.  You shall eat the head with the feet and entrails thereof.  Neither shall there remain any thing of it until morning.  If there be an thing left, you shall burn it with fire.  And thus you shall eat it: You shall gird your reins, and you shall have shoes on your feet, holding staves in your hands, and you shall eat in haste; for it is the Phase that is the Passage of the Lord.
!Tract
!Ps 139:2-10, 14
v. Deliver me, O Lord, from the evil man: rescue me from the unjust man.  
V. Who have devised iniquities in their hearts: all the day long they designed battles.  
V. They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; the venom of asps is under their lips.  
V. Keep me, O Lord, from the hand of the wicked: and from unjust men deliver me.  
V. Who have proposed to supplant my steps.  The proud have hidden a net for me.  
V. And they have stretched out cords for a snare for my feet; they have laid for me a stumbling-block by the wayside.  
V. I said to the Lord: Thou art my God. Hear, O Lord, the voice of my supplication.
V. O Lord, Lord, the strength of my salvation: overshadow my head in the day of battle.  
V. Give me not up from my desire to the wicked: they have plotted against me.  Do not Thou forsake me, lest at any time they should triumph.  
V. The head of them compassing me about: the labor of their lips shall overwhelm them.  
V. But the just shall give glory to Thy Name: and the upright shall dwell with Thy countenance.

!!Passion
! The Deacons of the Passion then kneel and bow low before the celebrant, who pronounces in a clear voice:.
P. May the Lord be in your hearts and on your lips.  
R.  Amen.
The Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ according to St. John.
!John 18. 1-40; 19. 1-42
At that time Jesus went forth with His disciples over the brook Cedron, where~
there was a garden, into which He entered with His disciples.  And Judas also,~
who betrayed Him, knew the place: because Jesus had often resorted thither~
together with His disciples.  Judas therefore having received a band of~
soldiers and servants from the chief priests and the Pharisees, cometh thither~
with lanterns and torches and weapons.  Jesus therefore, knowing that all~
things that should come upon Him, went forth and said to them:  J. Whom seek~
ye?  C. They answered Him:  S. Jesus of Nazareth.  C. Jesus saith to them: J. I~
am He.  C. And Judas also, who betrayed Him, stood with them.  As soon~
therefore as He had said to them: J. I am He; they went backward and fell to~
the ground.  Again therefore He asked them: J. Whom seek ye?  C. And they said:~
S. Jesus of Nazareth.  C. Jesus answered: J. I have told you that I am He.  If~
therefore you seek Me, let these go their way;  C. That the word might be~
fulfilled which He said: Of them whom Thou hast given Me, I have not lost~
anyone.  Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the servant of~
the high priest and cut off his right ear.  And the name of the servant was~
Malchus.  Jesus therefore said to Peter: J. Put up thy sword in the scabbard.~
The chalice which My Father hath given Me, shall I not drink it?  C. Then the~
band and the tribune and the servants of the Jews took Jesus, and bound Him.~
And they led Him away to Annas first, for he was father-in-law to Caiphas, who~
was the high priest that year.  Now Caiphas was he who had given the counsel to~
the Jews: that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.  And~
Simon Peter followed Jesus: and so did another disciple.  And that disciple was~
known to the high priest and went in with Jesus into the court of the high~
priest.  But Peter stood at the door without.  The other disciple therefore,~
who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the portress and~
brought in Peter. The maid therefore that was portress saith to Peter: S. Art~
not thou also one of this man's disciples?  C. He saith: S. I am not. C. Now~
the servants and ministers stood at a fire of coals, because it was cold, and~
warmed themselves.  And with them was Peter, also, standing and warming~
himself. The high priest therefore asked Jesus of His disciples and of His~
doctrine.  Jesus answered him: J. I have spoken openly to the world. I have~
always taught in the synagogue and in the temple, whither all the Jews resort:~
and in secret I have spoken nothing.  Why asketh thou Me?  Ask them who have~
heard what I have spoken unto them.  Behold they know what things I have said.~
C. And when He had said these things, one of the servants, standing by, gave~
Jesus a blow, saying: S. Answerest Thou the high priest so?  C. Jesus answered~
him: J. If I have spoken evil, give testimony of the evil; but if well, why~
strikest thou Me?  C. And Annas sent Him bound to Caiphas the high priest.  And~
Simon Peter was standing and warming himself.  They said therefore to him: S.~
Art not thou also one of His disciples?  C. He denied it and said: S. I am not.~
C. One of the servants of the high priest a kinsman to him whose ear Peter cut~
off saith to him: S. Did I not see thee in the garden with Him?  C. Again~
therefore Peter denied; and immediately the cock crew. Then they led Jesus from~
Caiphas to the governor's hall.  And it was morning; and they went not into the~
hall, that they might not be defiled, but that they might eat the Pasch.~
Pilate therefore went out to them, and said: S. What accusation bring you~
against this man?  C. They answered and said to him: S. If He were not a~
malefactor, we would not have delivered Him up to thee.  C. Pilate therefore~
said to them: S. Take Him you, and judge Him according to your law.  C. The~
Jews therefore said to him: S. It is not lawful for us to put any man to death.~
C. That the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which He said, signifying what~
death He should die.  Pilate therefore went into the hall again and called~
Jesus and said to Him: S. Art Thou the King of the Jews?  C. Jesus answered: J.~
Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or have other told it thee of Me?  C. Pilate~
answered: S. Am I a Jew?  Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered~
Thee up to me.  What hast Thou done?  C. Jesus answered: J. My kingdom is not~
of this world.  If My kingdom were of this world, My servants would certainly~
strive that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now My kingdom is not~
from hence.  C. Pilate therefore said to Him: S. Art Thou a King then?  C.~
Jesus answered: J. Thou sayest I am a king.  For this was I born, and for this~
came I into the world; that I should give testimony of the truth.  Every one~
that is of the truth heareth My voice.  C. Pilate saith to Him: S. What is~
truth?  C. And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews and saith~
to them: S. I find no cause in Him.  But you have a custom that I should~
release one unto you at the Pasch.  Will you, therefore, that I release unto~
you the King of the Jews?  C. Then cried they all again, saying: S. Not this~
man, but Barabbas.  C. Now Barabbas was a robber.  Then therefore Pilate took~
Jesus and scourged Him.  And the soldiers platting a crown of thorns, put it~
upon His head; and they put on Him a purple garment.  And they came to Him and~
said: S. Hail, King of the Jews.  C. And they gave Him blows.  Pilate therefore~
went forth again and saith to them: S. Behold, I bring Him forth unto you, that~
you may know that I find no cause in Him.  C. Jesus therefore came forth,~
bearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment.  And he saith to them: S.~
Behold the man.  C. When the chief priests, therefore, and the servants had~
seen Him, they cried out, saying: S. Crucify Him, crucify Him.  C. Pilate saith~
to them: S. Take Him you, and crucify Him; for I find no cause in Him.  C. The~
Jews answered him: S. We have a law, and according to the law He ought to die,~
because He made Himself the Son of God.  C. When Pilate, therefore, had heard~
this saying, he feared the more.  And he entered into the hall again; and he~
said to Jesus: S. Whence art Thou?  C. But Jesus gave him no answer.  Pilate~
therefore saith to Him: S. Speakest Thou not to me?  Knowest Thou not that I~
have power to crucify Thee, and I have power to release Thee?  C. Jesus~
answered: J. Thou shouldst not have any power against Me, unless it were given~
thee from above.  Therefore, he that hath delivered Me to thee hath a greater~
sin.  C. And from henceforth Pilate sought to release Him.  But the Jews cried~
out, saying: S. If thou release this Man, thou art not Caesar's friend.  For~
whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.  C. Now when Pilate~
had heard these words, he brought Jesus forth and sat down in the judgment~
seat, in the place that is called Lithostrotos, and in Hebrew Gabbatha.  And it~
was Parasceve of the Pasch, about the sixth hour; and he saith to the Jews: S.~
Behold your King.  C. But they cried out: S. Away with Him.  Away with Him:~
Crucify Him.  C. Pilate saith to them: S. Shall I crucify your King?  C. The~
chief priests answered: S. We have no king but Caesar.  C. Then, therefore, he~
delivered Him to them to be crucified. And they took Jesus and led Him forth.~
And bearing His cross, He went forth to that place which is called Calvary but~
in Hebrew Golgotha.; where they crucified Him, and with Him two others, one on~
each side and Jesus in the midst.  And Pilate wrote a title also: and he put it~
upon the cross.  And the writing was: Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.~
This title therefore many of the Jews did read: because the place where Jesus~
was crucified was nigh to the city.  And it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and~
in Latin.  Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate: S. Write not: The~
King of the Jews; but that He said: I am the King of the Jews.  C. Pilate~
answered: S. What I have written, I have written.  C. The soldiers therefore,~
when they had crucified Him, took His garments and they made four parts, to~
every soldier a part and also His coat.  Now the coat was without seam, woven~
from the top throughout.  They said then one to another: S. Let us not cut it,~
but let us cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the Scripture might be~
fulfilled which saith: They have parted My garemnts among them, and upon My~
vesture they have cast lots.  And the soldiers indeed did these things.  Now~
there stood by the cross of Jesus His Mother, and His Mother's sister, Mary of~
Cleophas, and Mary Magdalen.  When Jesus therefore had seen His Mother and the~
disciple standing whom He loved, He saith to His Mother: J. Woman, behold thy~
son.  C. After that, He saith to the disciple: J. Behold thy mother.  C. And~
from that hour, the disciple took her to his own. Afterwards, Jesus, knowing~
that all things were now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled,~
said: J. I thirst.  C. Now there was a vessel set there, full of vinegar.  And~
they, putting a sponge full of vinegar about hyssop, put it to His mouth.~
Jesus therefore, when He had taken the vinegar, said: J. It is consummated.  C.~
And bowing His head, He gave up the ghost.
!Here all kneel and pause a few moments.
Then the Jews because it was the Parasceve, that the bodies might not remain~
upon the cross on the Sabbath day for that was a great Sabbath day, besought~
Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away.  The~
soldiers therefore came, and they broke the legs of the first, and of the other~
that was crucified with Him.  But after they were come to Jesus, when they saw~
that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.  But one of the soldiers~
with a spear opened His side, and immediately there came out blood and water.~
And he that saw it hath given testimony: and his testimony is true.  And he~
knoweth that he saith true: that you also may believe.  For these things were~
done that the Scripture might be fulfilled: you shall not break a bone of Him.~
And again another Scripture saith: They shall look on Him whom they pierced.~
And after these things, Joseph of Arimathea because he was a disciple of Jesus,~
but secretly for fear of the Jews besought Pilate that he might take away the~
Body of Jesus.  And Pilate gave leave.  He came therefore and took away the~
Body of Jesus.  And Nicodemus also came he who at the first came to Jesus by~
night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pound weight.~
They took therefore the Body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths, with the~
spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.  Now there was in the place where~
He was crucified a garden: and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein no man~
yet had been laid.  There, therefore, because of the Parasceve of the Jews,~
they laid Jesus, because the sepulchre was nigh at hand.

!!Adoration of the Cross
! After these Collects, the Ministers lay aside their cope and chasubles and stand at the sedilia.  The Deacon goes with the Acolytes to the Sacristy, whence they return in procession with lighted candles carrying the veiled cross (which should be as large as possible), the Celebrant and Subdeacon coming forward to meet them before the center of the altar.  The Celebrant carries the Cross (with assistance, if necessary) to the Epistle side of the sanctuary and, turning towards the people, he uncovers the upper portion of the Cross and intones the verse:
V. Behold the wood of the Cross, on which hung the Saviour of the world.
R. Come, let us adore.
! When the choir sings these words, all kneel, except the celebrant.  The priest then advances to the front corner, and uncovers the right arm; elevating the Crucifix a little, he sings on a higher tone than before:
V. Behold the wood of the Cross, on which hung the Saviour of the world.
R. Come, let us adore.
! Then at the middle of the altar the Celebrant uncovers the whole Cross, and, lifting it up, begins still higher, the ministers and choir continuing as before:
V. Behold the wood of the Cross, on which hung the Saviour of the world.
R. Come, let us adore.
! Two assistants take the unveiled Cross to the center of the sanctuary, where they stand facing the people and supporting the Cross upright by the arms; the acolytes place their candles at either side of the Cross and themselves kneel down facing the Cross throughout the adoration that follows.  The celebrant and his ministers and assistants take off their shoes, and each in turn approaches, genuflecting thrice, and kisses the feet of the Crucifix. The Cross, still supported by the two assistants and candles and acolytes, is then placed more conveniently for the adoration of the faithful; these should form a procession past the Cross, men first, women afterwards, and after one simple genuflection devoutly kiss the feet of the Crucified. Meanwhile two choirs should be singing the Improperia or Reproaches.
!REPROACHES
! Two cantors sing the following:
V. O my people, what have I done to thee? or wherein have I afflicted thee?  Answer me.  
V. Because I led thee out of  the land of Egypt, thou hast prepared a cross for thy Saviour.
R. O holy God!
R. O holy God!
R. O holy strong One!
R. O holy strong One!
R. O holy immortal one, have mercy on us.
R. O holy immortal one, have mercy on us.
! Two cantors:
V. Because I led thee out through the desert forty years: and fed thee with manna, and brought thee into a land exceeding good, thou hast prepared a Cross for thy Saviour.
R. O holy God!
R. O holy God!
R. O holy strong One!
R. O holy strong One!
R. O holy immortal one, have mercy on us.
R. O holy immortal one, have mercy on us.
! Two cantors:
V. What more ought I have done for thee, that I have not done?  I planted thee, indeed, My most beautiful vineyard: and thou hast become exceeding bitter to Me: for in My thirst thou gavest Me vinegar to drink: and with a lance thou hast pierced  the side of thy Saviour.
R. O holy God!
R. O holy God!
R. O holy strong One!
R. O holy strong One!
R. O holy immortal one, have mercy on us.
R. O holy immortal one, have mercy on us.
_
_
! The verses of the following reproaches are sung alternately by two cantors of each choir.  The choirs respond after each verse: Popule meus . . .  as far as the verse Quia.
V. For thy sake I scourged Egypt with its first-born: and thou hast scourged Me and delivered Me up.
R. O my people, what have I done to thee? or wherein have I afflicted thee?  Answer me.
V. I led thee out of Egypt having drowned Pharao in the Red Sea: and thou hast delivered Me to the chief priests.
R. O my people, what have I done to thee? or wherein have I afflicted thee?  Answer me.
V. I opened the sea before thee: and thou with a spear hast opened My side.
R. O my people, what have I done to thee? or wherein have I afflicted thee?  Answer me.
V. I went before thee in a pillar of cloud:  and thou hast led Me to the judgement hall of Pilate.
R. O my people, what have I done to thee? or wherein have I afflicted thee?  Answer me.
V. I fed thee with manna in the desert; and thou hast beaten Me with whips and scourges.
R. O my people, what have I done to thee? or wherein have I afflicted thee?  Answer me.
V. I gave thee the water of salvation from the rock to drink: and thou hast given Me gall and vinegar.
R. O my people, what have I done to thee? or wherein have I afflicted thee?  Answer me.
V. For thy sake I struck the kings of the Chanaanites: and thou hast struck My head with a reed.
R. O my people, what have I done to thee? or wherein have I afflicted thee?  Answer me.
V. I gave thee a royal sceptre: and thou hast given to My head a crown of thorns.
R. O my people, what have I done to thee? or wherein have I afflicted thee?  Answer me.
V. I exalted thee with great strength: and thou hast hanged Me on the gibbet of the Cross.
R. O my people, what have I done to thee? or wherein have I afflicted thee?  Answer me.
! The following anthem is then sung:
Ant. We adore Thy Cross, O Lord: and we praise and glorify Thy holy Resurrection: for behold by the wood of the Cross joy has come into the whole world. 
!Ps. 66:2
v. May God have mercy on us, and bless us: may He cause the light of His countenance to shine upon us, and have mercy on us.
Ant. We adore Thy Cross, O Lord: and we praise and glorify Thy holy Resurrection: for behold by the wood of the Cross joy has come into the whole world. 
_
_
!CRUX FIDELIS
! Afterwards the hymn Pange lingua lauream is sung in the following manner with the Crux fidelis.
Ant. Faithful Cross! above all other, One and only noble Tree! None in foliage, none in blossom, None in fruit thy peer may be; * Sweetest wood and sweetest iron, Sweetest weight is hung on thee.
v. Sing, my tongue, the glorious battle!
With completed victory rife!
And above the Cross's trophy
Tell the triumph of the strife:
How the world's Redeemer conquer'd
By the offering of His life.
_ `
Ant. Faithful Cross! above all other, One and only noble Tree! None in foliage, none in blossom, None in fruit thy peer may be.
v. God, his Maker, sorely grieving,
That the first-made Adam fell,
When he ate the fruit of sorow,
Whose reward was death and hell,
Noted then this Wood the ruin,
Of the ancient wood to quell.
_ `
Ant. Sweetest wood and sweetest iron, Sweetest weight is hung on thee.
v. For this work of our salvation
Needs must have its order so,
And the manifold deceiver's
Art by art would overthrow,
And from thence would bring the healing,
Whence the insult of the foe.
_ `
Ant. Faithful Cross! above all other, One and only noble Tree! None in foliage, none in blossom, None in fruit thy peer may be.
v. Wherefore when the appointed fullness
Of the holy time was come,
He was sent who maketh all things
From th' eternal Father's home,
And proceeded, God Incarnate,
Offspring of the Virgin's womb.
_ `
Ant. Sweetest wood and sweetest iron, Sweetest weight is hung on thee.
v. Weeps the Infant in the manger 
That in Bethlehem's stable stands: 
And His Limbs the Virgin Mother 
Doth compose in swaddling bands, 
Meetly thus in linen folding 
Of her God the feet and hands.
_ `
Ant. Faithful Cross! above all other, One and only noble Tree! None in foliage, none in blossom, None in fruit thy peer may be.
v. Thirty years among us dwelling,
His appointed time fulfilled,
Born for this, He meets His Passion,
For that this He freely willed:
On the Cross the Lamb is lifted,
Where His life-blood shall be spilled.
_ `
Ant. Sweetest wood and sweetest iron, Sweetest weight is hung on thee.
v. He endured the nails, the spitting,
Vinegar, and spear, and reed;
From that holy Body broken
Blood and water forth proceed:
Earth, and stars, and sky, and ocean,
By that flood from stain are freed.
_ `
Ant. Faithful Cross! above all other, One and only noble Tree! None in foliage, none in blossom, None in fruit thy peer may be.
Bend thy boughs, O Tree of glory!
Thy relaxing sinews bend;
For awhile the ancient rigor,
That thy birth bestowed, suspend:
And the King of heavenly beauty
On thy bosom gently tend!
_ `
Ant. Sweetest wood and sweetest iron, Sweetest weight is hung on thee.
v. Thou alone wast counted worthy
This world's ransom to uphold;
For a shipwrecked race preparing
Harbor, like the Ark of old;
With the sacred Blood anointed
From the smitten Lamb that rolled.
_ `
Ant. Faithful Cross! above all other, One and only noble Tree! None in foliage, none in blossom, None in fruit thy peer may be.
v. To the Trinity be glory
Everlasting, as is meet:
Equal to the Father, equal
To the Son, and Paraclete:
Trinal Unity, Whose praises
All created things repeat.
Amen.
Ant. Sweetest wood and sweetest iron, Sweetest weight is hung on thee.

! The Cross is placed at the center of the altar so that it can be seen by all in the church, and the acolytes' candles are placed on either side.  The Sacred Ministers change into purple vestments, but only the Deacon goest to the Altar of Repose with the acolytes.  There he withdraws the Ciborium from the tabernacle without incensation, and returns to the High Altar, each acolyte carrying one of the lighted candles from the Altar of Repose.  Meanwhile everyone else kneels, and the choir sings these antiphons:
v. We adore Thee, O Christ, and we bless Thee, because by Thy Cross Thou hast redeemed the world.
v. Through a tree we were enslaved, and through a holy Cross have we been set free: the fruit of a tree led us astray, the Son of God bought us back.
v. Saviour of the world, do Thou save us, do Thou, who through Thy Cross and Blood didst redeem us, do Thou help us, our God, we beseech Thee.

!!Communion
! At the High Altar the Deacon places the Ciborium on a corporal, and the Celebrant and Subdeacon with double genuflections join him there.  Without delay the Celebrant recites:
v. Let us pray. 
Instructed by Thy saving precepts, and following Thy divine institution, we make bold to say:
! Whereupon all present, clergy and faithful, recite the Pater Noster in Latin, as preparation for Communion; this recitation should be "solemn, grave, distinct."
v.  Our Father, who art in Heaven: hallowed be Thy name.  Thy kingdom come.  Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven.  Give us this day our daily bread: and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.  And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.  Amen.
! The Celebrant continues alone with:
v. Deliver us, we beseech Thee, O Lord, from all evils, past, present, and to come; and by the intercession of the blessed and glorious ever Virgin Mary, Mother of God, and of the Holy Apostles, Peter and Paul, and of Andrew, and of all the Saints, mercifully grant peace in our days, that through the assistance of Thy mercy we may be always free from sin, and secure from all disturbance.  Through the same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who with Thee in the unity of the Holy Ghost liveth and reigneth God, world without end.
! And all answer together:
R. Amen.
! The celebrant joins his hands and bows, and in a lower voice continues:
v. Let not the partaking of Thy Body, O Lord Jesus Christ, which I, though unworthy, presume to receive, turn to my judgment and condemnation; but let it, through Thy mercy, become a safeguard and remedy, both for soul and body; Who with God the Father, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, livest and reignest God, for ever and ever.  Amen.
! He opens the Ciborium, genuflects, and takes out a sacred particle.  He then makes his Communion as usual:
v. Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldst enter under my roof; say but the word, and my soul shall be healed.  
v. Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldst enter under my roof; say but the word, and my soul shall be healed.
v. Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldst enter under my roof; say but the word, and my soul shall be healed.
v. May the body of our Lord Jesus Christ preserve my soul unto life everlasting.  Amen.
_
_
! Holy Communion is now distributed as on Maundy Thursday, except that priests wear a purple stole, not white. When all have communicated, the Celebrant purifies his fingers and places the Ciborium in the tabernacle in silence.  All stand, in order to join him in his thanksgiving, which he recites in ferial tone:
_ `
v. Let us pray. 
Upon Thy people who with devout hearts have recalled the Passion and Death of Thy Son, we beseech Thee, O Lord, may plentiful blessings descend: may gentleness be used with us, and consolation given us, may our faith increase in holiness, our redemption for ever made firm.  Through the same Christ our Lord.  Amen.
R. Amen.
_ `
v. Let us pray. 
Almighty and merciful God, who hast restored us by the Passion and Death of Thy Christ: preserve within us the work of Thy mercy; that by our entering into this mystery we may ever live devoutly.  Through the same Christ our Lord.  Amen.
R. Amen.
_ `
v. Let us pray. 
Be mindful of Thy mercies, O Lord, and hallow with eternal protection us Thy servants, from whom Christ Thy Son established through His Blood this mystery of the Pasch.  Through the same Christ our Lord.  Amen.
R.  Amen.
! The Ministers genuflect before retiring to the Sacristy.
