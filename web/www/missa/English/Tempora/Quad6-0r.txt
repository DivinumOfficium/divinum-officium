!!Gospel
Continuation ++ of the holy Gospel according to Matthew.
R. Glory be to Thee, O Lord.
!Matt 21:1-9
At that time, when Jesus drew nigh to Jerusalem, and was come to Bethphage, unto Mount Olivet, then He sent two disciples, saying to them: Go ye into the village that is over against you, and immediately you shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them and bring them to Me.  And if any man shall say anything to you, say ye, that the Lord hath need of them: and forthwith he will let them go.  Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: Tell ye the daughter of Sion: Behold thy King cometh to thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of her that is used to the yoke.  And the disciples going, did as Jesus commanded them.  And they brought the ass and the colt, and laid their garments upon them, and made him sit thereon.  And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way: and others cut boughs from the trees, and strewed them in the way, and the multitudes that went before and that followed, cried, saying: Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord.
R. Praise be to Thee, O Christ.
S. By the words of the Gospel may our sins be blotted out.

!!PSALM 147
v. Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem: * praise thy God, O Sion.
Because He hath strengthened the bolts of thy gates: * He hath blessed thy children within thee.

Who sendeth forth His speech to the earth: * His word runneth swiftly.
Who giveth snow like wool: * scattereth mists like ashes.
He sendeth His crystal like morsels: * Who shall stand before the face of His cold?
He shall send out His Word and shall melt them: * His wind shall blow and the waters shall run.
Who declareth His word to Jacob: * His justice and His judgements to Israel.
He hath not done in like manner to every nation: * and His judgements He hath not made manifest to them.

[Introitus]
!Ps 21:20, 22
v. O Lord, be not far from me; O my help, hasten to aid me. Save me from the lions mouth; form the horns of the wild bulls, my wretched life.
!Ps 21:2
My God, my God, look upon me, why have You forsaken me? Far from my salvation are the words of my sins.
v. O Lord, be not far from me; O my help, hasten to aid me. Save me from the lions mouth; form the horns of the wild bulls, my wretched life.

[Oratio]
Almighty, eternal God, Who, to provide mankind an example of humility for it to imitate, willed that the Saviour should assume our flesh and suffer death upon the Cross, mercifully grant that we may be found worthy of the lesson of His endurance and the fellowship of His resurrection.
$Per eumdem

[Lectio]
Lesson from the letter of St. Paul to the Philippians
!Phil 2:5-11
Brethren: Have this in mind in you which was also in Christ Jesus, Who, though He was by nature God, did not consider being equal to God a thing to be clung to, but emptied Himself, taking the nature of a slave and being made like unto men. And appearing in the form of man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient to death, even to death on a cross. Therefore God also has exalted Him and has bestowed upon Him the Name that is above every name, (Kneel) so that at the Name of Jesus every knee should bend of those in heaven, on earth and under the earth and every tongue should confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the Father.

[Graduale]
!Ps 72:24, 1-3
You have hold of my right hand; with Your counsel You guide me; and in the end You will receive me in glory.
V. How good God is to Israel, to those who are clean of heart! But, as for me, I almost lost my balance; my feet all but slipped, because I was envious of sinners when I saw them prosper though they were wicked.
_
!Tractus
!Ps 21:2-9, 18-19, 22, 24, 32
My God, my God, look upon me: why have You forsaken me?
V. Far from my salvation, are the words of my sins.
V. O my God, I cry out by day and You answer not; by night, and there is no relief.
V. But You are enthroned in the holy place, O glory of Israel!
V. In You our fathers trusted; they trusted and You delivered them.
V. To You they cried, and they escaped; in You they trusted, and they were not put to shame.
V. But I am a worm, not a man; the scorn of men, despised by the people.
V. All who see me, scoff at me; they mock me with parted lips, they wag their heads.
V. He relied on the Lord; let Him deliver him, let Him rescue him, if He loves him.
V. But they look on and gloat over me; they divide my garments among them, and for my vesture they cast lots.
V. Save me from the lions mouth; from the horns of the wild bulls, my wretched life.
V. You who fear the Lord, praise Him: all you descendants of Jacob, give glory to Him.
V. There shall be declared to the Lord a generation to come: and the heavens shall show forth His justice.
V. To a people that shall be born, which the Lord has made.
