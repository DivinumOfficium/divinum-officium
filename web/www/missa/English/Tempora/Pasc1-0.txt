Lesson from the first letter of St John the Apostle
!1 John 5:4-10
Dearly beloved, Whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory, which overcometh the world, our faith. Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? This is He that came by water and blood, Jesus Christ: not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit which testifieth that Christ is the truth. And there are three who give testimony in heaven: the Father, the Word and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one. And there are three that give testimony on earth: the Spirit and the water and the blood; and these three are one. If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater: for this is the testimony of God, which is greater, because He hath testified of His Son. He that believeth in the Son of God hath the testimony of God in himself.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 20. 19-31
At that time, when it was late that same day, the first of the week, and the~
doors were shut, where the disciples were gathered together for fear of the Jews,~
Jesus came, and stood in the midst and said to them: Peace be to you. And when~
He had said this, He showed them His hands and His side. The disciples therefore~
were glad, when they saw the Lord. He said therefore to them again: Peace be to~
you. As the Father hath sent Me, I also send you. When He had said this, He~
breathed on them, and He said to them: Receive ye the Holy Ghost: whose sins you~
shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are~
retained. Now Thomas, one of the Twelve, who is called Didymus, was not with~
them when Jesus came. The other disciples therefore said to him: We have seen~
the Lord. But he said to them: Except I shall see in His hands the print of the~
nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into His~
side, I will not believe. And after eight days, again His disciples were within,~
and Thomas with them. Jesus cometh, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst,~
and said: Peace be to you. Then He saith to Thomas: Put in thy finger hither, and~
see My hands, and bring hither thy hand, and put into My side; and be not~
faithless, but believing. Thomas answered and said to Him: my Lord and my God.~
Jesus saith to him: Because thou hast seen Me, Thomas, thou hast believed;~
blessed are they that have not seen, and have believed. Many other signs also~
did Jesus in the sight of His disciples, which are not written in this book. But~
these are written, that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God;~
and that, believing, you may have life in His Name.
