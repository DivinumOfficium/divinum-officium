Lesson from the book of Isaias
!Isa 38:1-6
In those days, when Ezechia was mortally ill, the prophet Isaiah, son of Amos, came and said to him; Thus says the Lord: ‘Put your house in order, for you are about to die; you shall not recover.’ Then Ezechia turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord: O Lord, remember how faithfully and wholeheartedly I conducted myself in Your presence, doing what was pleasing to You! And Ezechia wept bitterly. Then the word of the Lord came to Isaiah: Go, tell Ezechia: Thus says the Lord, the God of your father David: I have heard your prayer and seen your tears. I will add fifteen years to your life. I will rescue you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria; I will be a shield to this city, says the Lord almighty.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 8:5-13
At that time, when Jesus had entered Capharnaum, there came to Him a centurion,~
who entreated Him, saying, Lord, my servant is lying sick in the house,~
paralyzed, and is grievously afflicted. Jesus said to him, I will come and cure~
him. But in answer the centurion said, Lord, I am not worthy that You should~
come under my roof; but only say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I~
too am a man subject to authority, and have soldiers subject to me; and I say to~
one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant,~
‘Do this,’ and he does it. And when Jesus heard this, He marveled, and said to~
those who were following Him, Amen I say to you, I have not found such great~
faith in Israel. And I tell you that many will come from the east and from the~
west, and will feast with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven,~
but the children of the kingdom will be put forth into the darkness outside;~
there will be the weeping, and the gnashing of teeth. Then Jesus said to the~
centurion, Go your way; as you have believed, so be it done to you. And the~
servant was healed in that hour.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 24:1-3
To You, O Lord, I lift up my soul: in You, O my God, I trust; let me not be put~
to shame, let not my enemies exult over me. No one who waits on You shall be put~
to shame.

[Secreta]
O Lord, we beseech You to look with favor upon these offerings before You, and~
may they be profitable to our devotion as well as to our salvation.
