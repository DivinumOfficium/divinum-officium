[Lectio]
Lesson from the first letter of St. Peter the Apostle
!1 Pet 2:21-25
Dearly beloved, Christ suffered for us, leaving you an example, that you should follow His steps who did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth. Who when He was reviled, did not revile: when He suffered, He threatened not, but delivered Himself to him that judged Him unjustly: who His own self bore our sins in His body upon the tree: that we, being dead to sins, should live to justice; by whose stripes you were healed. For you were as sheep going astray: but you are now converted to the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.

[Graduale]
Allelúja, allelúja.
!Luke 24:35
The disciples knew the Lord Jesus in the breaking of bread. Allelúja.
!John 10:14
I am the good Shepherd: and I know My sheep, and Mine know Me. Allelúja.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 10:11-16
At that time Jesus said to the Pharisees: I am the good Shepherd. The good Shepherd giveth his life for his sheep. But the hireling, and he that is not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and flieth: and the wolf catcheth and scattereth the sheep: and the hireling flieth, because he is a hireling, and he hath no care for the sheep. I am the good Shepherd: and I know Mine, and Mine know Me, as the Father knoweth Me, and I know the Father: and I lay down My life for My sheep. And other sheep I have that are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one fold and one shepherd.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 62:2; 62:5
O God, my God, to Thee do I watch at break of day: and in Thy Name I will lift up my hands, allelúja.

[Secreta]
May this holy offering, O Lord, always bring to us Thy healing blessing: that what it represents in a Mystery, it may accomplish with power.
