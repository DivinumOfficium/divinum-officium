Lesson from the book of Joel
!Joel 2:23-24; 26-27
Thus says the Lord God: O children of Sion, exult and rejoice in the Lord, your God! He has given you the teacher of justice: He has made the rain come down for you, the early and the late rain as before. The threshing floors shall be full of grain and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil. You shall eat and be filled, and shall praise the name of the Lord, your God, because He has dealt wondrously with you; My people shall nevermore be put to shame. And you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel; I am the Lord, your God, and there is no other; My people shall nevermore be put to shame, says the Lord almighty.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 5:17-26.
At that time, it came to pass on one of the days, that Jesus sat teaching. And~
there were Pharisees and teachers of the Law sitting by, who had come out of~
every village of Galilee and Judea and out of Jerusalem. And the power of the~
Lord was present to heal them. And behold, some men were carrying upon a pallet a~
man who was paralyzed, and they were trying to bring him in and to lay him~
before Him. And as they found no way of bringing him in, because of the crowd,~
they went up onto the roof and lowered him through the tiles, with his pallet,~
into the midst before Jesus. And seeing their faith, He said, Man, your sins are~
forgiven you. And the Scribes and Pharisees began to argue, saying, Who is this~
man who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God only? But Jesus,~
knowing their thoughts, answered and said to them, Why are you arguing in your~
hearts? Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Arise~
and walk’? But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to~
forgive sins - He said to the paralytic - I say to you, arise, take up your~
pallet and go to your house. And immediately he arose before them, took up what~
he had been lying on, and went away to his house, glorifying God. And~
astonishment seized upon them all, and they glorified god and were filled with~
fear, saying, We have seen wonderful things today.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 145:1-2
Praise the Lord, O my soul; I will praise the Lord all my life; I will sing~
praise to my God while I live, alleluia.

May the sacrificial gifts offered in Your sight, O Lord, be consumed by that~
divine fire which the Holy Spirit enkindled in the hearts of the disciples of~
Christ, Your Son.

[Communio]
!John 14:18.
I will not leave you orphans; I will come to you again, alleluia: and your heart~
shall rejoice, alleluia.

[Postcommunio]

that what You have taught us to do in commemoration of You, may profit and help~
us in our weakness.
