Lesson from the second letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians
!2 Cor. 3:4-9
Brethren: Such is the assurance I have through Christ toward God. Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything, as from ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God. He also it is Who has made us fit ministers of the new covenant, not of the letter but of the spirit; for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life. Now if the ministration of death, which was engraved in letters upon stones, was inaugurated in such glory that the children of Israel could not look steadfastly upon the face of Moses on account of the transient glory that shone upon it, shall not the ministration of the spirit be still more glorious? For if there is glory in the ministration that condemned, much more does the ministration that justifies abound in glory.

[Graduale]
!Ps 33:2-3
I will bless the Lord at all times; His praise shall be ever in my mouth.
V. Let my soul glory in the Lord; the lowly will hear and be glad. Alleluia,~
alleluia.
!Ps 87:2
O Lord, the God of my salvation, by day I cry out, at night I clamor in Your~
presence. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 10:23-37
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples: Blessed are the eyes that see what~
you see! For I say to you, many prophets and kings have desired to see what you~
see, and they have not seen it; and to hear what you hear, and they have not~
heard it. And behold, a certain lawyer got up to test Him, saying, Master, what~
must I do to gain eternal life? But He said to him, What is written in the Law?~
How do you read? He answered and said, You shall love the Lord your God with~
your whole heart, and with your whole soul, and with your whole strength, and~
with your whole mind; and your neighbor as yourself. And He said to him, You~
have answered rightly; do this and you shall live. But he, wishing to justify~
himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor? Jesus answered and said, A~
certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell in with~
robbers, who after both stripping him and beating him went their way, leaving~
him half-dead. But, as it happened, a certain priest was going down the same way;~
and when he saw him, he passed by. And likewise a Levite also, when he was near~
the place and saw him, passed by. But a certain Samaritan as he journeyed came~
upon him, and seeing him, was moved with compassion. And he went up to him and~
bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. And setting him on his own beast,~
he brought him to an inn and took care of him. And the next day he took out two~
denarii and gave them to the innkeeper and said, ‘Take care of him; and whatever~
more you spend, I, on my way back, will repay you.’ Which of these three, in~
your opinion, proved himself neighbor to him who fell among the robbers? And he~
said, He who took pity on him. And Jesus said to him, Go and do also in like~
manner.

[Offertorium]
!Ex 32:11, 13-14.
Moses prayed in the sight of the Lord his God and said, Why, O Lord, is Your~
indignation enkindled against Your people? Let the anger of Your mind cease;~
remember Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to whom You swore to give a land flowing~
with milk and honey. And the Lord was appeased from doing the evil which He had~
spoken of doing against His people.

[Secreta]
O Lord, we beseech You, graciously look upon the offerings which we lay upon~
Your sacred altar; so that they may bring us plentiful forgiveness while they~
give honor to Your name.

[Communio]
!Ps 103:13-15
The earth is replete with the fruit of Your works, O Lord; You produce bread~
from the earth, and wine to gladden men’s hearts, so that their faces gleam with~
oil, and bread fortifies the hearts of men.

[Postcommunio]
May the holy reception of this sacrament, we beseech You, O Lord, restore us to~
life, and bestow upon us forgiveness and protection.
