Lesson from the first letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians
!1 Cor. 4:1-5
Brethren: Let a man so account us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God. Now here it is required in stewards that a man be found trustworthy. But with me it is a very small matter to be judged by you or by man’s tribunal. Nay I do not even judge my own self. For I have nothing on my conscience, yet I am not thereby justified; but he who judges me is the Lord. Therefore, pass no judgment before the time, until the Lord comes, Who will both bring to light the things hidden in darkness and make manifest the counsels of hearts; and then everyone will have his praise from God.

[Graduale]

V. Come, O Lord, and delay not; forgive the sins of Your people Israel.~
Alleluia.

!Ps 144:18, 20
The Lord is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth.

Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate~
was procurator of Judea, and Herod tetrarch of Galilee, and Philip his brother~
tetrarch of the district of Iturea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of~
Abilene, during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiphas, the word of God came~
to John, the son of Zachary, in the desert. And he went into all the region~
about the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins,~
as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, The voice of~
one crying in the desert, ‘Make ready the way of the Lord, make straight His~
paths. Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be~
brought low, and the crooked ways shall be made straight, and the rough ways~
smooth; and all mankind shall see the salvation of God.’
