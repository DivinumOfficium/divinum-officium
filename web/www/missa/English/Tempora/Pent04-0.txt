Lesson from the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans
!Rom 8:18-23
Brethren: I reckon that the sufferings of the present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory to come that will be revealed in us. For the eager longing of creation awaits the revelation of the sons of God. For creation was made subject to vanity - not by its own will but by reason of Him Who made it subject - in hope, because creation itself also will be delivered from its slavery to corruption into the freedom of the glory of the sons of God. For we know that all creation groans and travails in pain until now. And not only it, but we ourselves also who have the first-fruits of the Spirit - we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption as sons of God, the redemption of our body, in Christ Jesus our Lord.

[Graduale]
!Ps. 78:9-10
Pardon our sins, O Lord; why should the nations say, Where is their God?
V. Help us, O God our Saviour; because of the glory of Your name, O Lord, deliver~
us. Alleluia, alleluia.
!Ps. 9:5; 9:10
O God, seated on Your throne, judging justly: be a stronghold for the oppressed~
in times of distress. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 5:1-11
At that time, while the crowds were pressing upon Jesus to hear the word of God,~
He was standing by Lake Genesareth. And He saw two boats moored by the lake, but~
the fishermen had left them and were washing their nets. And getting into one of~
the boats, the one that was Simon’s, He asked him to put out a little from the~
land. And sitting down, He began to teach the crowds from the boat. But when He~
had ceased speaking, He said to Simon, Put out into the deep, and lower your~
nets for a catch. And Simon answered and said to Him, Master, the whole night~
through we have toiled and have taken nothing; but at Your word I will lower the~
net. And when they had done so, they enclosed a great number of fishes, but~
their net was breaking. And they beckoned to their comrades in the other boat to~
come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began~
to sink. But when Simon Peter saw this, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying,~
Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord. For he and all who were with him~
were amazed at the catch of fish they had made; and so were also James and John,~
the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Do~
not be afraid; henceforth you shall catch men. And when they had brought their~
boats to land, they left all and followed Him.

[Offertorium]
!Ps. 12:4-5
Give light to my eyes that I may never sleep in death, lest my enemy say, I have~
overcome him.

[Secreta]
Be appeased, we beseech You, O Lord, by accepting our offerings, and in Your~
kindness make even our rebellious wills turn to You.
