[Lectio]
Lesson from the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Galatians
!Gal 5:16-24
Brethren: Walk in the Spirit, and you will not fulfill the lusts of the flesh. For the flesh lusts against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh; for these are opposed to each other, so that you do not do what you would. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law. Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are immorality, uncleanness, licentiousness, idolatry, witchcrafts, enmities, contentions, jealousies, anger, quarrels, factions, parties, envies, murders, drunkenness, carousings, and suchlike. And concerning these I warn you, as I have warned you, that they who do such things will not attain the kingdom of God. But of the fruit of the Spirit is: charity, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, long-suffering, mildness, faith, modesty, continency, chastity. Against such things there is no law. And they who belong to Christ have crucified their flesh with its passions and desires.

[Graduale]

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 6:24-33
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples: No man serve two masters; for either~
he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will stand by the one and~
despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon. Therefore I say to you, do~
not be anxious for your life, what you shall eat; nor yet for your body, what~
you shall put on. Is not the life a greater thing than the food, and the body~
than the clothing? Look at the birds of the air: they do not sow, or reap, or~
gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are not you of much more~
value than they? But which of you by being anxious about it can add to his~
stature a single cubit? And as for clothing, why are you anxious? Consider how~
the lilies of the field grow; they neither toil nor spin, yet I say to you that~
not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed like one of those. But if God so~
clothes the grass of the field, which flourishes today but tomorrow is thrown~
into the oven, how much more you, O you of little faith! Therefore do not be~
anxious, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or, ‘What shall we drink?’ or, ‘What are~
we to put on?’ - for after all these things the Gentiles seek; - for your Father~
knows that you need all these things. But seek first the Kingdom of God and His~
justice, and all these things shall be given you besides.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 33:8-9
The Angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear Him, and delivers them.~
Taste and see how good the Lord is.

[Secreta]
Grant us, Lord, we beseech You, that this salutary sacrifice may be not only a~
cleansing from our sins but also a propitiation of Your divine power.

!Matt 6:33
Seek first the Kingdom of God; and all things shall be given you besides, says~

everlasting salvation.
