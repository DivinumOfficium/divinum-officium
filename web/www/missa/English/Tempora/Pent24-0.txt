Lesson from the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Colossians
!Col 1:9-14
Brethren: We have been praying for you unceasingly, asking that you may be filled with knowledge of God’s will, in all spiritual wisdom and understanding. May you walk worthily of God and please Him in all things, bearing fruit in every good work and growing in the knowledge of God. May you be completely strengthened through His glorious power unto perfect patience and long-suffering; joyfully rendering thanks to God the Father, Who has made us worthy to share the lot of the saints in light. He has rescued us from the power of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of His beloved Son, in Whom we have our redemption, through His Blood, the remission of our sins.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 24:15-35
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples: When you see the abomination of~
desolation, which was spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy~
place - let him who reads understand - then let those who are in Judea flee to~
the mountains; and let him who is on the housetop not go down to take anything~
from his house; and let him who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak.~
But woe to those who are with child, or have infants at the breast in those~
days! But pray that your flight may not be in the winter, or on the Sabbath. For~
then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of~
the world until now, nor will be. And unless those days had been shortened, no~
living creature would be saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be~
shortened. Then if anyone say to you, ‘Behold, here is the Christ,’ or ‘There He~
is,’ do not believe it. For false christs and false prophets will arise, and~
will show great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the~
elect. Behold, I have told it to you beforehand. If therefore they say to you,~
‘Behold, He is in the desert,’ do not go forth; ‘Behold, He is in the inner~
chambers,’ do not believe it. For as the lightning comes forth from the east and~
shines even to the west, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. Wherever~
the body is, there will the eagles be gathered together. But immediately after~
the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not~
give her light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven~
will be shaken. And then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven; and~
then will all tribes of the earth mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming~
upon the clouds of heaven with great power and majesty. And He will send forth~
His angels with a trumpet and a great sound, and they will gather His elect from~
the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other. Now from the fig tree~
learn this parable. When its branch is now tender, and the leaves break forth,~
you know that summer is near. Even so, when you see all these things, know that~
it is near, even at the door. Amen I say to you, this generation will not pass~
away till all these things have been accomplished. Heaven and earth will pass~
away, but my words will not pass away.

[Secreta]
Be merciful, O Lord, to our humble requests and accept the offerings and prayers~
of Your people: turn the hearts of all of us to You, that, freed from earthly~
cravings, we may pass over to heavenly yearnings.

[Postcommunio]
Grant us, we beseech You, O Lord, that all the evil in our hearts may be cured~
by the healing power of the sacrament we have received.
