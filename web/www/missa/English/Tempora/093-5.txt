Lesson from the book of Osee the Prophet
!Osee 14:2-10
Thus says the Lord God: "Return, O Israel, to the Lord your God; for you have fallen down by your iniquity. Take with you words, and return to the Lord, and say to Him: Take away all iniquity, and receive the good, and we will render the calves of our lips. Assyria shall not save us, we will not ride upon horses, neither will we say anymore: The works of our hands are our gods; for You will have mercy on the fatherles that is in You. I will heal their breaches, I will love them freely; for My wrath is turned away from them. I will be as the dew: Israel shall spring as the lily, and his root shall shoot forth as that of Lebanon. His branches shall spread, and his glory shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as that of Lebanon. They shall be converted that sit under his shadow, they shall live upon wheat, and they shall blossom as a vine: his memorial shall be as the wine of Lebanon. Ephraim shall say: What have I to do any more with idols? I will hear him, and will make him flourish like a green fig-tree: from Me is your fruit found. Who is wise, and he shall understand these things; prudent, and he shall know these things? For the ways of the Lord are right, and the just shall walk in them, but the transgressors shall fall in them."

[Evangelium]
Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 7:36-50
At that time, one of the Pharisees asked Jesus to dine with him; so He went into the house of the Pharisee and reclined at table. And behold, a woman in the town who was a sinner, upon learning that He was at table in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster jar of ointment; and standing behind Him at His feet, she began to bathe His feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head, and kissed His feet, and anointed them with ointment. Now when the Pharisee, who had invited Him, saw it, he said to himself, This Man, were He a prophet, would surely know who and what manner of woman this is who is touching Him, for she is a sinner. And Jesus answered and said to him, Simon, I have something to say to you. And he said, Master, speak. A certain money-lender had two debtors; the one owed five hundred denarii, the other fifty. As they had no means of paying, he forgave them both. Which of them, therefore, will love him more? Simon answered and said, He, I suppose, to whom he forgave more. And He said to him, You have judged rightly. And turning to the woman, He said to Simon, Do you see this woman? I came into your house; you gave Me no water for My feet; but she has bathed My feet with tears, and has wiped them with her hair. You gave Me no kiss; but she, from the moment she entered, has not ceased to kiss My feet. You did not anoint My head with oil; but she has anointed My feet with ointment. Wherefore I say to you, her sins, many as they are, shall be forgiven her, because she has loved much. But he to whom little is forgiven, loves little. And they who were at table with Him began to say within themselves, Who is this Man, Who even forgives sins? But He said to the woman, Your faith has saved you, go in peace.
