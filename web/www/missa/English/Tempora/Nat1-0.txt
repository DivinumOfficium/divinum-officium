Lesson from the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Galatians
!Gal 4:1-7
Brethren: As long as the heir is a child, he differs in no way from a slave, though he is the master of all; but he is under guardians and stewards until the time set by his father. So we too, when we were children, were enslaved under the elements of the world. But when the fullness of time came, God sent His Son, born of a woman, born under the Law, that He might redeem those who were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father. So that He is no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, an heir also through God.

[Graduale]
!Ps 44:3, 2
Fairer in beauty are You than the sons of men; grace is poured out upon Your~
lips.
V. My heart overflows with a goodly theme; as I sing my ode to the King, my~
tongue is nimble as the pen of a skillful scribe. Alleluia, alleluia.
!Ps 92:1
V. The Lord is King, in splendor robed; robed is the Lord and girt about~
with strength. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 2:33-40
At that time, Joseph and Mary, the mother of Jesus were marvelling at the things~
spoken concerning Him. And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary His mother,~
Behold, this Child is destined for the fall and for the rise of many in Israel,~
and for a sign that shall be contradicted. And your own soul a sword shall~
pierce, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed. There was also Anna, a~
prophetess, daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser. She was of a great age,~
having lived with her husband seven years from her maidenhood, and by herself as a~
widow to eighty-four years. She never left the temple, with fastings and prayers~
worshipping night and day. And coming up at that very hour, she began to give~
praise to the Lord, and spoke of Him to all who were awaiting the redemption of~
Jerusalem. And when they had fulfilled all things as prescribed in the Law of~
the Lord, they returned to Galilee, into their own town of Nazareth. And the~
Child grew and became strong. He was full of wisdom and the grace of God was~
upon Him.
