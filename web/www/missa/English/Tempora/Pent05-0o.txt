[Lectio]
Lesson from the first letter of St. Peter the Apostle
!1 Pet 3:8-15.
Beloved: Be all like-minded in prayer, compassionate, lovers of the brethren, merciful, reserved, humble; not rendering evil for evil, or abuse for abuse, but contrariwise, blessing; for unto this were you called that you might inherit a blessing. For, He who would love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no deceit. Let him turn away from evil and do good, let him seek after peace and pursue it. For the eyes of the Lord are upon the just, and His ears unto their prayers; but the face of the lord is against those who do evil. And who is there to harm you, if you are zealous for what is good? But even if you suffer anything for justice’ sake, blessed are you. So have no fear of their fear and do not be troubled. But hallow the Lord Christ in your hearts.

[Graduale]
!Ps. 83:10, 9
Behold, O God, our protector, and look on Your servants.
V. O Lord God of Hosts, hear the prayers of Your servants. Alleluia, alleluia.
!Ps. 20:1
V. O Lord, in Your strength the king is glad; in Your victory how greatly he~
rejoices! Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 5:20-24.
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples: Unless your justice exceeds that of~
the Scribes and Pharisees, you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven. You have~
heard that it was said to the ancients, ‘You shall not kill’; and that whoever~
shall kill shall be liable to judgment. But I say to you that everyone who is~
angry with his brother shall be liable to judgment; and whoever says to his~
brother, ‘Raca,’ shall be liable to the Sanhedrin; and whoever says, ‘You fool!’,~
shall be liable to the fire of Gehenna. Therefore, if you are offering your gift~
at the altar, and there remember that your brother has anything against you,~
leave your gift before the altar and go first to be reconciled to your brother;~
and then come and offer your gift.

[Offertorium]
!Ps. 15:7-8.
I bless the Lord Who counsels me; I set God ever before me; with Him at my right~
hand I shall not be disturbed.

[Secreta]
Be favorable, O Lord, to our humble prayers, and graciously accept these~
offerings of Your servants, men and women, that what each has offered to the~
honor of Your name may profit for the salvation of all.

[Communio]
!Ps. 26:4.
One thing I ask of the Lord; this I seek: to dwell in the house of the Lord all~
the days of my life.

[Postcommunio]
Grant us, we beseech You, O Lord, that we whom You have filled with the heavenly~
gift may be cleansed of our hidden sins and delivered from the snares of our~
enemies.
