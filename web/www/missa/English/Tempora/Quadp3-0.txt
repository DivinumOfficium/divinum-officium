[Lectio]
Lesson from the first letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians
!1 Cor. 13:1-13
Brethren: If I should speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have charity, I have become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal. And if I have prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains, yet do not have charity, I am nothing. And if I distribute all my goods to feed the poor, and if I deliver my body to be burned, yet do not have charity, it profits me nothing. Charity is patient, is kind; charity does not envy, is not pretentious, is not puffed up, is not ambitious, is not self-seeking, is not provoked; thinks no evil, does not rejoice over wickedness, but rejoices with the truth; bears with all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Charity never fails, whereas prophecies will disappear, and tongues will cease, and knowledge will be destroyed. For we know in part and we prophesy in part; but when that which is perfect has come, that which is imperfect will be done away with. When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child. Now that I have become a man, I have put away the things of a child. We see now through a mirror in an obscure manner, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know even as I have been known. So there abide faith, hope and charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 18:31-43
At that time, Jesus taking to Himself the Twelve said to them, Behold, we are~
going up to Jerusalem, and all things that have been written by the prophets~
concerning the Son of Man will be accomplished. For He will be delivered to the~
Gentiles, and will be mocked and scourged and spit upon; and after they have~
scourged Him, they will put Him to death; and on the third day He will rise~
again. And they understood none of these things and this saying was hidden from~
them, neither did they get to know the things that were being said. Now it came~
to pass as He drew near to Jericho, that a certain blind man was sitting by the~
wayside, begging; but hearing a crowd passing by, he inquired what this might~
be. And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by. And he cried out,~
saying, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me! And they who went in front~
angrily tried to silence him. But he cried out all the louder, Son of David,~
have mercy on me! Then Jesus stopped and commanded that he should be brought to~
Him. And when he drew near, He asked him, saying, What would you have Me do for~
you? And he said, Lord, that I may see. And Jesus said to him, Receive your~
sight, your faith has saved you. And at once he received his sight, and followed~
Him, glorifying God. And all the people upon seeing it gave praise to God.
