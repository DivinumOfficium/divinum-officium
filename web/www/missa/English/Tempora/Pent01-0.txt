Lesson from the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans
!Rom 11:33-36.
Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God! How incomprehensible and His judgments and how unsearchable His ways! For Who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been His counselor? Or who has first given to Him, that recompense should be made him? For from Him and through Him and unto Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever. Amen.
