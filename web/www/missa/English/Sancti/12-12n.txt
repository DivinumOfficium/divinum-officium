Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus
!Ecclus 24:23-31
I bud forth delights like the vine, my blossoms become fruit fair and rich. I am the mother of fair love, and of fear, and of knowledge, and of holy hope. In me is all grace of the way and of the truth, in me is all hope of life and of virtue. Come to me, all you that yearn for me, and be filled with my fruits; for my spirit is sweeter than honey, and my inheritance better to have than honey and the honeycomb. My memory is to everlasting generations. They who eat of me will hunger still, and they who drink of me will thirst for more. He who obeys me will not be put to shame, they who serve me will never fail. They who explain me shall have life everlasting.

[Graduale]
!Cant 6:9
Who is this that comes forth like the dawn, as beautiful as the moon, as~
resplendent as the sun?
!Ecclus 50:8
V. Like the rainbow appearing in the bright clouds, and as the flower of roses~
in springtime. Alleluia, alleluia.
!Cant 2:12
V. The flowers appear in our land, the time of pruning has come. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 1:39-47
At that time, Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country, to a town of~
Juda. And she entered the house of Zachary and saluted Elizabeth. And it came to~
pass, when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, that the babe in her womb~
leapt. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit, and cried out with a loud~
voice, saying, Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your~
womb! And how have I deserved that the Mother of my Lord should come to me? For~
behold, the moment that the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the babe in~
my womb leapt for joy. And blessed is she who has believed, because the things~
promised her by the Lord shall be accomplished. And Mary said, My soul magnifies~
the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour.

[Offertorium]
!2 Par. 7:16

eyes and My heart may remain there forevermore.
