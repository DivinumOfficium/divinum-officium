[Officium]
St. Sylvester, Abbot

[Oratio]
Most merciful God, Who when the holy Abbot Sylvester was devoutly meditating upon the vanity of this world beside an open grave, graciously willed to call him into the desert and enrich him with unusual merits, we humbly pray that, following his example, despising the things of earth, we may thoroughly enjoy Your everlasting presence.
$Per Dominum

[Secreta]
We beseech You, O Lord, that while offering these sacrificial gifts to Your Divine Majesty, we may become like the blessed Abbot Sylvester by devout preparation of mind and purity of heart, and so be found worthy to receive in a holy manner the Body and Blood of Your Son.
$Qui tecum

[Postcommunio]
We pray You, O Lord, grant that we who have renewed our strength at the heavenly banquet may closely follow in the footsteps of the holy Abbot Sylvester, that we may have an abundant reward with the Saints in the Kingdom of Your glory.
