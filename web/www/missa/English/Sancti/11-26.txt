[Oratio]
Most merciful God, Who when the holy Abbot Sylvester was devoutly meditating~
upon the vanity of this world beside an open grave, graciously willed to call~
him into the desert and enrich him with unusual merits, we humbly pray that,~
following his example, despising the things of earth, we may thoroughly enjoy~
Your everlasting presence.

[Commemoratio Oratio]
!For St. Peter Of Alexandria
Be mindful of our weakness, almighty God, and because the burden of our sins~
weighs heavily upon us, may the glorious intercession of blessed Peter, Your~
Martyr and Bishop, sustain us.
$Per Dominum

[Secreta]
We beseech You, O Lord, that while offering these sacrificial gifts to Your~
Divine Majesty, we may become like the blessed Abbot Sylvester by devout~
preparation of mind and purity of heart, and so be found worthy to receive in a~
holy manner the Body and Blood of Your Son.
$Qui tecum

[Commemoratio Secreta]

O Lord, graciously accept, through the merits of Your blessed Martyr and Bishop,~
Peter, the sacrificial gifts dedicated to You, and grant that they may prove to~
be for us a lasting help.

[Postcommunio]
We pray You, O Lord, grant that we who have renewed our strength at the heavenly~
banquet may closely follow in the footsteps of the holy Abbot Sylvester, that we~
may have an abundant reward with the Saints in the Kingdom of Your glory.

[Commemoratio Postcommunio]
!For St. Peter of Alexandria
Refreshed by partaking of the sacred gift, we beseech You, O Lord our God, that~
we may enjoy the benefits of the rite we perform through the intercession of~
blessed Peter, Your Martyr and Bishop.
