[Lectio]
Lesson from the letter of St James the Apostle
!James 1:2-12
Dearly beloved: Esteem it all joy, when you fall into various trials, knowing that the trying of your faith begets patience. And let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and entire, lacking nothing. But if any of you is wanting in wisdom, let him ask it of God, Who gives abundantly to all men, and does not reproach; and it will be given to him. But let him ask with faith, without hesitation. For he who hesitates is like a wave of the sea, driven and carried about by the wind. Therefore, let not such a one think that he will receive anything from the Lord, being a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways. But let the brother of lowly condition glory in his high estate, and the rich man in his low condition; for he will pass away like the flower of the grass. For the sun rises with a burning heat and parches the grass, and its flower fails and the beauty of its appearance perishes. So too will the rich man wither in his ways. Blessed is the man who endures temptation; for when he has been tried, he will receive the crown of life which God has promised to those who love Him.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Mark
!Mark 13:33-37
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples, Take heed, watch and pray, for you do~
not know when the time is: just as a man, when he leaves home to journey abroad,~
puts his servants in charge, to each his work, and gives orders to the porter to~
keep watch. Watch, therefore, for you do not know when the master of the house~
is coming, in the evening, or at midnight, or at cockcrow, or early in the~
morning; lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping. And what I say to you, I say~
to all, ‘Watch.’

[Offertorium]
!Ps 88:21-22
I have found David, My servant; with My holy oil I have anointed him, that My~
hand may be always with him, and that My arm may make him strong.

[Secreta]
Grant, we beseech You, O Lord, through the intercession of Your holy Martyr and~
Bishop, Donatus, whom we honor with gifts consecrated to the praise of Your name,~
that the fruit of devout prayer may increase in us.
