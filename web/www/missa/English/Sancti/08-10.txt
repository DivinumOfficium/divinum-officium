Lesson from the second letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians
!2 Cor. 9:6-10

Brethren: He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. Let each one give according as he has determined in his heart, not grudgingly or from compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. And God is able to make all grace abound in you, so that always having ample means, you may abound in every good work, as it is written, He has scattered abroad and has given to the poor, his justice remains forever. Now He Who provides the sower his seed will both give you bread to eat and will multiply your seed, and will increase the growth of the fruits of your justice.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 12:24-26
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples, Amen, amen, I say to you, unless the~
grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone. But if it dies,~
it brings forth much fruit. He who loves his life, loses it; and he who hates~
his life in this world, keeps it unto life everlasting. If anyone serves Me, let~
him follow Me; and where I am there also shall My servant be. If anyone serves~
me, My Father will honor him.

[Offertorium]
