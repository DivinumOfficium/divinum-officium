Lesson from the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews
!Heb 1:1-12
God, Who at sundry times and in divers manners spoke in times past to the fathers by the prophets, last of all in these days has spoken to us by His Son, Whom He appointed heir of all things, by Whom also He made the world; Who, being the brightness of His glory and the image of His substance, and upholding all things by the word of His power, has effected man’s purgation from sin and taken His seat at the right hand of the Majesty on high, having become so much superior to the angels as He has inherited a more excellent name than they. For to which of the angels has He ever said, You are My Son, I this day have begotten You? and again, I will be to Him a Father, and He shall be to Me a Son? And again, when He brings the firstborn into the world, He says, And let all the angels of God adore Him. And of the angels indeed He says, He makes His angels spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire. But of the Son, Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and a sceptre of equity is the sceptre of Your kingdom. You have loved justice and hated iniquity; therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of gladness above Your fellows. And, You in the beginning, O Lord, did found the earth, and the heavens are works of Your hands. They shall perish, but You shall continue; and they shall all grow old as does a garment, and as a vesture shall You change them, and they shall be changed. But You are the same, and Your years shall not fail.

[Graduale]
!Ps 97: 3, 4, 2
All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation by our God. Sing joyfully to~
God, all you lands.
V. The Lord has made His salvation known: in the sight of the nations He has~
revealed His justice. Alleluia, alleluia.
V. A sanctified day has shone upon us; come, you nations, and adore the Lord:~
for this day a great light has descended upon the earth. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation ++ of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 1:1-14
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God; and the Word was God.~
He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him, and without~
Him was made nothing that has been made. In Him was life, and the life was the~
light of men. And the light shines in the darkness; and the darkness grasped it~
not. There was a man, one sent from God, whose name was John. This man came as a~
witness, to bear witness concerning the light, that all might believe through~
him. He was not himself the light, but was to bear witness to the light. It was~
the true light that enlightens every man who comes into the world. He was in the~
world, and the world was made through Him, and the world knew Him not. He came~
unto His own, and His own received Him not. But to as many as received Him He~
gave the power of becoming sons of God; to those who believe in His name: who~
were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man,~
but of God. And the Word was made flesh (Genuflect), and dwelt among us. And we~
saw His glory - glory as of the Only-begotten of the Father - full of grace and~
of truth.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 88:12, 15
Yours are the heavens, and Yours is the earth; the world and its fullness You~
have founded. Justice and judgment are the foundation of Your throne.

[Secreta]
Make holy the sacrificial gifts we offer, O Lord, and by the new birth of Your~
only-begotten Son cleanse us from the stains of our sins.
