[Lectio]
Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus
!Sir 24:23-31
I bud forth delights like the vine, my blossoms become fruit fair and rich. I am the mother of fair love, and of fear, and of knowledge, and of holy hope. In me is all grace of the way and of the truth, in me is all hope of life and of virtue. Come to me, all you that yearn for me, and be filled with my fruits; for my spirit is sweeter than honey, and my inheritance better to have than honey and the honeycomb. My memory is to everlasting generations. They who eat of me will hunger still, and they who drink of me will thirst for more. He who obeys me will not be put to shame, they who serve me will never fail. They who explain me shall have life everlasting.

[Graduale]
!  
Blessed and venerable are you, O Virgin Mary, who, without spot, were found the mother of the Saviour.
V. O Virgin Mother of God, He Whom the whole world cannot contain, shut Himself~
in your womb, becoming man. Alleluia, alleluia.
V. Mother of God, the life that had been lost was given us through you, who~
received your offspring from heaven, and brought forth a Saviour into the world.~
Alleluia.

the word of God and keep it.

[Offertorium]

Remember, O Virgin Mother, to speak good things before God’s face in our behalf,~
