Lesson from the book of Isaias
!Isa 60:1-6
Rise up in splendor, O Jerusalem! Your light has come, the glory of the Lord shines upon you. See, darkness covers the earth, and thick clouds cover the peoples; but upon you the Lord shines, and over you appears His glory. Nations shall walk by your light, and kings by your shining radiance. Raise your eyes and look about; they all gather and come to you: your sons come from afar, and your daughters in the arms of their nurses. Then you shall be radiant at what you see, your heart shall throb and overflow, for the riches of the sea shall be emptied out before you, the wealth of nations shall be brought to you. Caravans of camels shall fill you, dromedaries from Madian and Epha; all from Saba shall come bearing gold and frankincense, and proclaiming the praises of the Lord.

[Graduale]
!Isa 60:6, 1
All they from Saba shall come, bringing gold and frankincense, and proclaiming~
the praises of the Lord.

Alleluia, alleluia.
!Matt 2:2
V. We have seen His star in the East: and have come with gifts to worship the~
Lord. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 1:29-34
At that time, John saw Jesus coming to him, and he said, Behold, the Lamb of God,~
Who takes away the sin of the world! This is He of Whom I said, ‘After me there~
comes One Who has been set above me, because He was before me.’ And I did not~
know Him. But that He may be known to Israel, for this reason have I come~
baptizing with water. And John bore witness, saying, I beheld the Spirit~
descending as a dove from heaven, and it abode upon Him. And I did not know Him.~
But He Who sent me to baptize with water said to me, ‘He upon Whom you will see~
the Spirit descending, and abiding upon Him, He it is Who baptizes with the Holy~
Spirit.’ And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 71:10-11
The kings of Tharsis and the Isles shall offer gifts; the kings of Arabia and~
Saba shall bring tribute. All kings shall pay Him homage, all nations shall~
serve Him.

[Secreta]
We bring You offerings, O Lord, for the epiphany of Your Son, Who has been born,~
humbly beseeching You that, as He is the creator of our gifts, so also He may~
mercifully receive them, our Lord Jesus Christ.
