Lesson from the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews
!Heb 7:23-27
Brethren: The priests were numerous, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office; but Jesus, because He continues forever, has an everlasting priesthood. Therefore He is able at all times to save those who come to God through Him, since He lives always to make intercession for them. For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, set apart from sinners, and become higher than the heavens. He does not need to offer sacrifices daily - as the other priests did - first for His own sins, and then for the sins of the people; for this latter He did once for all in offering up Himself, Jesus Christ our Lord.

[Graduale]
!Ps 131:16-17
Her priests I will clothe with salvation, and her faithful ones shall shout~
merrily for joy.
V. In her will I make a horn to sprout for David; I will place a lamp for My~
anointed. Alleluia, alleluia.
!Ps 109:4
V. The Lord has sworn, and He will not repent: "You are a priest forever,~
according to the order of Melchisedec." Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 24:42-47
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples, "Watch, for you do not know at what~
hour your Lord is to come. But of this be assured, that if the householder had~
known at what hour the thief was coming, he would certainly have watched, and~
not have let his house be broken into. Therefore you also must be ready, because~
at an hour that you do not expect, the Son of Man will come. Who, do you think,~
is the faithful and prudent servant whom his master has set over his household~
to give them their food in due time? Blessed is that servant whom his master,~
when he comes, shall find so doing. Amen I say to you, he will set him over all~
his goods."

[Offertorium]
!Ps 88:25
My faithfulness and My kindness shall be with him, and through My name shall his~
horn be exulted.

[Secreta]
May the annual festival of blessed Anthony Mary, Your Confessor and Bishop, we~
beseech You, O Lord render us pleasing to Your loving kindness, so that this~
service of sacred propitiation may be a blessed recompense for him and secure~
for us the gifts of Your grace.
