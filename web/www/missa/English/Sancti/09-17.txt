[Lectio]
Lesson from the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Galatians
!Gal 6:14-18
Brethren: But as for me, God forbid that I should glory, save in us the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision but a new creation is of any account. And whoever follow this rule, peace and mercy upon them, even upon the Israel of God. Henceforth let no man give me trouble, for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus in my body. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.

V. The law of his God is in his heart, and his steps do not falter. Alleluia,~
alleluia.
V. The poor and lowly Francis enters heaven abounding in riches; he is acclaimed~
with celestial hymns. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 16:24-27
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone wishes to come after Me,~
let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me. For he who would~
save his life will lose it; but he who loses his life for My sake will find it.~
For what does it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, but suffer the loss~
of his own soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul? For the Son~
of Man is to come with His angels in the glory of His Father, and then He will~
render to everyone according to His conduct.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 88:25
My faithfulness and My kindness shall be with him, and through My name shall his~
horn be exalted.
