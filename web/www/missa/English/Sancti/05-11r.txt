Lesson from the book of Wisdom
!Wis. 5:1-5
The just shall stand with great assurance before their oppressors who set at nought their labors. Seeing this, these shall be shaken with dreadful fear, and amazed at the suddenness of the unlooked-for salvation. They shall say among themselves, rueful and groaning through anguish of spirit: These are they whom once we held as a laughingstock and as a type for mockery, fools that we were! Their life we deemed madness, and their death dishonored. See how they are accounted among the sons of God; how their lot is with the Saints!

who sees Me, sees also My Father. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 14:1-13
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples, Let not your heart be troubled. You~
believe in God, believe also in Me. In My Father’s house there are many~
mansions. Were it not so, I should have told you, because I go to prepare a~
place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again, and I~
will take you to Myself; that where I am, there you also may be. And where I go~
you know, and the way you know. Thomas said to Him, Lord! we do not know where~
You are going, and how can we know the way? Jesus said to him, I am the way, and~
the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father but through Me. If you had~
known Me, you would also have known My Father. And henceforth you do know Him,~
and you have seen Him. Philip said to Him, Lord, show us the Father and it is~
enough for us. Jesus said to him, Have I been so long a time with you, and you~
have not known Me? Philip, he who sees Me sees also the Father. How can you say,~
‘Show us the Father’? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father~
in Me? The words that I speak to you I speak not on My own authority. But the~
Father dwelling in Me, it is He Who does the works. Do you believe that I am in~
the Father and the Father in Me? Otherwise believe because of the works~
themselves. Amen, amen, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do~
he shall do, and greater than these he shall do, because I am going to the~
Father. And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do.
