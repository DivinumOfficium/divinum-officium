[Lectio]
Lesson from the book of Isaias
!Isa 58:7-11
Thus says the Lord: Share your bread with the hungry, shelter the oppressed and the homeless; clothe the naked when you see them, and do not turn your back on your own. Then your light shall break forth like the dawn, and your wound shall quickly be healed; your vindication shall go before you, and the glory of the Lord shall be your rear guard. Then you shall call, and the Lord will answer, you shall cry for help, and He will say: ‘Here I am! If you remove from your midst oppression, false accusation and malicious speech; if you bestow your bread on the hungry and satisfy the afflicted; then light shall rise for you in the darkness, and the gloom shall become for you like the midday; then the Lord will guide you always and give you plenty even on the parched land. He will renew your strength, and you shall be like a watered garden, like a spring whose water never fails.

[Graduale]
!Prov 5:16
Let your water sources be dispersed abroad, and in the streets divide your~
waters.
!Ps 111:5-6
V. Well for the man who is gracious and lends, who conducts his~
affairs with justice; he shall never be moved. Alleluia, alleluia.
!Ps 111:9
Lavishly he gives to the poor; his generosity shall endure forever. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 19:13-21
At that time, little children were brought to Jesus, that He might lay His hands~
on them and pray; but the disciples rebuked them. But Jesus said to them, Let~
the little children be, and do not hinder them from coming to Me, for of such is~
the kingdom of heaven. And when He had laid His hands on them, He departed from~
that place. And behold, a certain man came to Him and said, Good Master, what~
good work shall I do to have eternal life? He said to him, Why do you ask Me~
about what is good? One there is Who is good, and He is God. But if you will~
enter into life, keep the commandments. He said to Him, Which? And Jesus said,~
You shall not kill. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You~
shall not bear false witness. Honor your father and mother. And, you shall love~
your neighbor as yourself. The young man said to Him, All these I have kept;~
what is yet wanting to me? Jesus said to him, If you will be perfect, go, sell~
what you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven; and~
come, follow Me.

[Offertorium]
!Tob 12:12
When you prayed with tears, and buried the dead, and left your dinner, and hid~
the dead by day in your house, and buried them by night, I offered your prayer~
to the Lord.

manner reborn, may offer You this sacrifice of atonement as a most sweet~
fragrance.
