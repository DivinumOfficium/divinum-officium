Lesson from the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews
!Heb 11:33-39
Brethren: The Saints by faith conquered kingdoms, wrought justice, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, recovered strength from weakness, became valiant in battle, put to flight armies of aliens. Women had their dead restored to them by resurrection. Others were tortured, refusing to accept release, that they might find a better resurrection. Others had experience of mockery and stripes, yes, even of chains and prisons. They were stoned, they were sawed asunder, they were tempted, they were put to death by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, distressed, afflicted of whom the world was not worthy wandering in deserts, mountains, caves and holes in the earth. And all these, approved by the testimony of faith, were found in Christ Jesus our Lord.

[Graduale]

V. The bodies of the Saints are buried in peace, but their name lives on and on.~

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 5:1-12
At that time, Jesus seeing the crowds, went up the mountain. And when He was~
seated, His disciples came to Him. And opening His mouth He taught them, saying,~
Blessed are the poor is spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are~
the meek, for they shall possess the earth. Blessed are they who mourn, for they~
shall be comforted. Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for justice, for they~
shall be satisfied. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.~
Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall see God. Blessed are the~
peacemakers for they shall be called children of God. Blessed are they who~
suffer persecution for justice’ sake, for their is the kingdom of heaven.~
Blessed are you when men reproach you, and persecute you, and, speaking falsely,~
say all manner of evil against you, for My sake. Rejoice and exult, because your~
reward is great in heaven.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 67:36
God is wonderful in His Saints; the God of Israel is He Who gives power and~
strength to His people. Blessed be God! Alleluia.

May Your bountiful blessing descend upon us, O Lord, and by the prayers of Your~
holy Martyrs may it make our gifts acceptable to You, and make them a sacrament~
of redemption for us.

!Wisdom 3:4-6
For if before men they be punished, God tried them; as gold in the furnace, He~
proved them, and as sacrificial offerings He took them to Himself.

that we may enjoy the protection of those in honor of whose victories we~
rejoice.
