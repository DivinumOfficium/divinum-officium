[Lectio]
Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus
!Eccli 44:10-15
These were godly men whose virtues have not been forgotten; their wealth remains in their families, their posterity are a holy inheritance, and their seed has stood in the covenants. And their children for their sakes remain forever; their seed and their glory shall not be forsaken. All these are buried in peace, but their name lives on and on. At gatherings their wisdom is retold and the assembly sings their praises.

[Graduale]
!Ps 132:1-2
Behold, how good it is, and how pleasant, where brethren dwell as one! It is as when the precious ointment upon the head runs down over the beard, the beard of Aaron. Alleluia, alleluia. 
V. This is the true fraternal love, which conquers the wickedness of the world: holding fast to the glory of the heavenly kingdom, it has followed Christ. Alleluia.  

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 12:1-8
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples, Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. But there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, and nothing hidden that will not be made known. For what you have said in darkness will be said in the light; and what you have whispered in the inner chambers will be preached on the housetops. But I say to you, My friends: Do not be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have nothing more that they can do. But I will show you Whom you shall be afraid of; be afraid of Him Who, after He has killed, has power to cast into hell. Yes, I say to you, be afraid of Him. Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings? And yet not one of them is forgotten before God. Yes, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Therefore do not be afraid, you are of more value than many sparrows. And I say to you, everyone who acknowledges Me before men, him will the Son of Man also acknowledge before the angels of God.
