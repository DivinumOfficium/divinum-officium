Almighty, eternal God, Who in Your wondrous providence choose the weak things of~
the world to overcome the strong, mercifully grant unto us Your humble servants~
that, by the loving prayers of blessed Didacus, Your Confessor, we may be found~
worthy to be raised unto the everlasting glory of heaven.
