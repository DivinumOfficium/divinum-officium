Lesson from the second letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians
!2 Cor. 4:5-14
Brethren: We preach not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves merely as your servants in Jesus. For God, Who commanded light to shine out of darkness, has shone in our hearts, to give enlightenment concerning the knowledge of the glory of God, shining on the face of Christ Jesus. But we carry this treasure in vessels of clay, to show that the abundance of the power is God’s and not ours. In all things we suffer tribulation, but we are not distressed; we are sore pressed, but we are not destitute; we endure persecution, but we are not forsaken; we are cast down, but we do not perish; always bearing about in our body the dying of Jesus, so that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our bodily frame. For we the living are constantly being handed over to death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our mortal flesh. Thus death is at work in us, but life in you. But since we have the same spirit of faith, as shown in that which is written - I believed, and so I spoke - we also believed, wherefore we also speak. For we know that He Who raised up Jesus will raise up us also with Jesus, and will place us with you.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 10:23-28
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples, When they persecute you in one town,~
flee to another. Amen I say to you, you will not have gone through the towns of~
Israel before the Son of Man comes. No disciple is above his teacher, nor is~
the servant above his master. It is enough for the disciple to be like his~
teacher, and for the servant to be like his master. If they have called the~
master of the house Beelzebub, how much more those of his household! Therefore~
do not be afraid of them. For there is nothing concealed that will not be~
disclosed, and nothing hidden that will not be made known. What I tell you in~
darkness, speak it in the light; and what you hear whispered, preach it on the~
housetops. And do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the~
soul. But rather be afraid of Him, Who is able to destroy both soul and body in~
hell.

!Ps 88:21-22
I have found David, My servant; with My holy oil I have anointed him, that My~
hand may be always with him, and that My arm may make him strong, alleluia.
