[Officium]
St. Catherine of Siena, Virgin

[Oratio]
Grant, we beseech thee, O Almighty God, that we which do keep the birthday of thy blessed Virgin Catherine, and do year by year renew her memorial with solemn gladness in thy presence, may likewise be conformed to the pattern of her saintly walk with thee. 
$Per Dominum

[Secreta]
May there rise up before thee, O Lord, the prayers we offer on the feast of blessed Catherine, and the saving victim, fragrant with virgin sweetness.
$Per Dominum

[Postcommunio]
May the heavenly repast of which we have partaken bestow on us, O Lord, eternal life, as the blessed Virgin Catherine found in it the nourishment even of her mortal life.
