[Oratio]
O God, Who through blessed Alphonsus Mary, Your Confessor and Bishop, fired with~
love for souls, enriched Your Church with a new family; we beseech You that,~
taught by his saving counsels and strengthened by his example, we may be enabled~
happily to come to You.

[Lectio]
Lesson from the second letter of St. Paul the Apostle to Timothy
!2 Tim. 2:1-7
Dearly beloved: Be strengthened in the grace which is in Christ Jesus; and the things that you have heard from me through many witnesses, commend to trustworthy men who shall be competent in turn to teach others. Conduct yourself in work as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. No one serving as God's soldier entangles himself in worldly affairs, that he may please him whose approval he has secured. And again, one who enters a contest is not crowned unless he has competed according to the rules. The farmer who toils must be the first to partake of the fruits. Take in what I tell you, for the Lord will give you understanding in all things.

[Graduale]
!Ps 118:52-53
I remember your ordinances of old, O Lord, and I am comforted. Indignation~
seizes me because of the wicked who forsake Your law.
!Ps 39:11
V. Your justice I kept not hid within my heart; Your faithfulness and Your~
salvation I have spoken of. Alleluia, alleluia.
!Ecclus. 49:3-4
He was directed by God to the repentance of the nation, and he took away the~
abominations of wickedness. He turned to God with his whole heart, and though~
times were evil, he practiced virtue.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 10:1-9
At that time, the Lord appointed seventy-two others, and sent them forth two by~
two before Him into every town and place where He Himself was about to come. And~
He said to them, The harvest indeed is great, but the laborers are few. Pray~
therefore the Lord of the harvest to send forth laborers into His harvest. Go.~
Behold, I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves. Carry neither purse,~
nor wallet, nor sandals, and greet no one on the way. Whatever house you enter,~
first say, ‘Peace to this house!’ And if a son of peace be there, your peace~
will rest upon him; but if not, it will return to you. And remain in the same~
house, eating and drinking what they have; for the laborer deserves his wages.~
Do not go from house to house. And whatever town you enter, and they receive you,~
eat what is set before you, and cure the sick who are there, and say to them,~
‘The kingdom of God is at hand for you.

[Offertorium]
!Pr 3:9, 27
Honor the Lord with your wealth, and give Him the first fruits of all your~
produce. Do not withhold him from doing good who is able; if you are able, do~
good yourself also.

[Secreta]
O Lord, Jesus Christ, Who granted to St. Aphonsus Mary to celebrate this rite~
and thereby offer himself as a holy victim to You, consume our hearts by the~
heavenly fire of this sacrifice so that it may ascend as a sweet fragrance unto~
You.

the temple, as a bright fire, and frankincense burning in the fire.

[Postcommunio]
O God, Who made St. Alphonsus Mary, Your Confessor and Bishop, a faithful~
dispenser of this divine sacrament, grant by his merits and prayers, that Your~
faithful may frequently receive it, and, receiving it, praise it forever.
