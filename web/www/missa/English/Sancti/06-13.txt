Lesson from the secons letter of St Paul the Apostle to Timotheus
!2 Tim. 4:1-8
Beloved: I charge you, in the sight of God and Christ Jesus, Who will judge the living and the dead by His coming and by His kingdom, preach the word, be urgent in season, out of season; reprove, entreat, rebuke with all patience and teaching. For there will come a time when they will not endure the sound doctrine; but having itching ears, will heap up to themselves teachers according to their own lusts, and they will turn away their hearing from the truth and turn aside rather to fables. But be watchful in all things, bear with tribulation patiently, work as a preacher of the Gospel, fulfill your ministry. As for me, I am already being poured out in sacrifice, and the time of my deliverance is at hand. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith. For the rest, there is laid up for me a crown of justice, which the Lord, the just Judge, will give to me in that day; yet not to me only, but also to those who love His coming.

[Secreta]
May the offering here before You, O Lord, bring safety to Your people, for whom~
You mercifully offered Yourself a living victim to the Father,
v. Who, with the same God the Father and the Holy Spirit, live and reign, God~
forever and ever.

[Postcommunio]
Refreshed by divine gifts, we beseech You, O Lord, that through the merits and~
intercession of blessed Anthony, Your Confessor and Doctor, we may experience~
the effect of the saving sacrifice.
