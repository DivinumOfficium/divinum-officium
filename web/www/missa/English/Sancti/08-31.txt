[Oratio]
O God, Who made blessed Raymund, Your Confessor, famous for delivering Your faithful from the captivity of the infidels, grant us by his intercession that, having been released from the bonds of our sins, we may with free minds do what is pleasing to You.

[Secreta]
We offer You sacrifices of praise, O Lord, in memory of Your Saints; trusting that by them we may be delivered from both present and future evils.
$Per Dominum

[Postcommunio]
Refreshed with heavenly food and drink, we humbly pray You, our God, that we also may be helped by his prayers in memory of whom we have partaken of these gifts.
