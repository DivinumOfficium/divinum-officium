[Oratio]
O God, Who in Your Confessor, blessed John, raised up a father and teacher of~
youth, and willed that through him, with the help of the Virgin Mary, new~
religious families should bloom in the Church, grant, we beseech You, that,~
inflamed by the same fire of love, we may seek to win souls and to serve You~
alone.

[Lectio]
Lesson from the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Philippians
!Phil 4:4-9
Brethren: Rejoice in the Lord always; again I say, rejoice. Let your moderation be known to all men. The Lord is near. Have no anxiety, but in every prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to God. And may the peace of God which surpasses all understanding guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. For the rest, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever honorable, whatever just, whatever holy, whatever lovable, whatever of good repute, if there be any virtue, if anything worthy of praise, think upon these things. And what you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, these things practice. And the God of peace will be with you.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 18:1-5
At that time, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the~
kingdom of heaven? And Jesus called a little child to Him, set him in their~
midst, and said, Amen I say to you, unless you turn and become like little~
children, you will not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whoever, therefore,~
humbles himself as this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of~
heaven. And whoever receives one such little child for My sake, receives Me.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 33:12
Come, children, hear me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord.

[Secreta]
