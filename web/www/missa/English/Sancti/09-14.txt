[Lectio]
Lesson from the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Philippians
!Phil 2:5-11
Brethren: Have this mind in you which was also in Christ Jesus, Who though He was by nature God, did not consider being equal to God a thing to be clung to, but emptied Himself, taking the nature of a slave and being made like unto men. And appearing in the form of man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient to death, even to death on a cross. Therefore God also has exalted Him and has bestowed upon Him the name that is above every name, (here all genuflect) so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bend of those in heaven, on earth and under the earth, and every tongue should confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the Father.

[Graduale]
!Phil 2:8-9
Christ became obedient for us to death, even to death on a cross.
V. Therefore God also has exalted Him, and has bestowed upon Him the name that~
is above every name. Alleluia, alleluia.
V. Sweet the wood, sweet the nails, sweet the load that hangs on you: to bear up~
the King and Lord of heaven, you alone were worthy. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 12:31-36
 At that time, Jesus said to the multitudes of the Jews, Now is the judgment of~
the world; now will the prince of the world be cast out. And I, if I be lifted~
up from the earth, will draw all things to Myself. Now he said this signifying~
by what death He was to die. The crowd answered Him, We have heard from the Law~
that the Christ abides forever. And how can You say, ‘The son of Man must be~
lifted up’? Who is this Son of Man? Jesus therefore said to them, Yet a little~
while the light is among you. Walk while you have the light, that darkness may~
not overtake you. He who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes.~
While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of~
light.

[Offertorium]
!  
Through the sign of the Holy Cross protect Your people, O Lord, from the snares~
of all their enemies, that we may pay You a worthy service, and our sacrifice~
may be acceptable to You.

[Secreta]
We who are about to take as nourishment the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ our~
Lord, through Whom the Cross became a holy emblem, beseech You, O Lord, that~
just as we have the grace to honor it, so we may forever enjoy the salvation it~
has won for us.
