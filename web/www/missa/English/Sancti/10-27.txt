[Officium]
Vigil of Sts. Simon and Jude, Apostles

[Oratio]
Almighty God, grant, we beseech thee, that as we are preventing thine Apostles Simon and Jude, their glorious birth - day, so the same may prevent thy Majesty to win thy good things for us. 
$Per Dominum

[Graduale]
Revenge, O Lord, the blood of thy Saints, which hath been shed.
V. They have given the dead bodies of thy servants to be meat for the fowls of the air: the flesh of thy saints for the beasts of the earth.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 149:5-6
The saints shall rejoice in glory: they shall be joyful in their beds. The high praise of God shall be in their mouth: and two-edged swords in their hands.

[Secreta]
Being conscious that the gifts, which we offer thee on the vigil of thy holy apostles Simon and Jude, are hindered from being acceptable to thee, by our guilty conscience; we humbly beseech thee, that their merits may recommend them to thee.

[Communio]
!Ps 78:2; 78:11
They have given the dead bodies of thy servants to be meat for the fowls of the air: the flesh of thy saints for the beasts of the earth: According to the greatness of thy arm, take possession of the children of them that have been put to death.

[Postcommunio]
Grant, O Lord, we humbly beseech thee, by the intercession of thy blessed Apostles Simon and Jude, that the sacrament, which we have received in this life, may procure for us life eternal.
