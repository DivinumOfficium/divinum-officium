Lesson from the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Galatians
!Gal 6:14-18
Brethren: But as for me, God forbid that I should glory, save in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision but a new creation is of any account. And whoever follows this rule, peace and mercy upon them, even upon the Israel of God. Henceforth let no man give me trouble, for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus Christ in my body. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 11:25-30
At that time, Jesus spoke and said, I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and~
earth, that You hid these things from the wise and prudent, and revealed them to~
little ones. Yes, Father, for such was Your good pleasure. All things have been~
delivered to Me by My Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father; nor~
does anyone know the Father except the Son, and him to whom the Son chooses to~
reveal Him. Come to Me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will give you~
rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn from Me, for I am meek and humble of~
heart; and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden~
light.

[Offertorium]

My faithfulness and My kindness shall be with him, and through My name shall his~
