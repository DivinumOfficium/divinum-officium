Arouse in Your Church, O Lord, the spirit with which blessed Josaphat, Your~
Martyr and Bishop, was filled when he laid down his life for his flock; so that,~
by his intercession, we, also moved and strengthened by the same spirit, may not~
fear to lay down our lives for our brethren.

[Lectio]
Lesson from the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews
!Heb 5:1-6
Brethren: Every high priest taken from among men is appointed for men in~
the things pertaining to God, that he may offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. He~
is able to have compassion on the ignorant and erring, because~
he himself also is beset with weakness, and by reason thereof is obliged to offer~
for sins, as on behalf of the people so also for himself. And no~
man takes the honor to himself; he takes it who is called by God, as Aaron was. So also Christ did~
not glorify Himself with the high priesthood, but He Who spoke to Him, "You are My Son, I this~
day have Begotten You." As He says also in another place, "You are a priest forever, according~
to the order of Melchisedec."

[Graduale]
!Ps 88:21-23
I have found David, My servant; with My holy oil I have anointed him, that My~
hand may be always with him, and that My arm may make him strong.
V. No enemy shall deceive him, nor shall the wicked afflict him. Alleluia,~
alleluia.
V. This is the priest whom the Lord has crowned. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 10:11-16
 At that time, Jesus said to the Pharisees: I am the Good Shepherd. The good~
shepherd lays down his life for his sheep. But the hireling, who is not a~
shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep~
and flees. And the wolf snatches and scatters the sheep; but the hireling flees~
because he is a hireling, and has no concern for the sheep. I am the Good~
Shepherd, and I know Mine and Mine know Me, even as the Father knows Me and I~
know the Father; and I lay down My life for My sheep. And other sheep I have~
that are not of this fold. Them also I must bring, and they shall hear My voice,~
and there shall be one fold and one Shepherd.

[Offertorium]
!John 15:13
Greater love than this no one has, that one lay down his life for his friends.

[Secreta]
Most merciful God, shower these offerings with Your blessing and strengthen us~
in the faith which St. Josaphat, Your Martyr and Bishop, upheld by the shedding~
of his blood.

[Communio]
!John 10:14
I am the Good Shepherd, and I know My sheep, and Mine know Me.

[Postcommunio]
May this heavenly food, O Lord, impart to us that spirit of strength which~
unfailingly sustained the life of blessed Josaphat, Your Martyr and Bishop, unto~
victory for the honor of Your Church.
