[Lectio]
A reading from the Epistle of blessed Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians.
!2 Cor 6:4-10
Brethren: Let us exhibit ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in tribulation, in necessities, in distresses, In stripes, in prisons, in seditions, in labours, in watchings, in fastings, In chastity, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in sweetness, in the Holy Ghost, in charity unfeigned, In the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armour of justice on the right hand and on the left; By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true; as unknown, and yet known; As dying, and behold we live; as chastised, and not killed; As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as needy, yet enriching many; as having nothing, and possessing all things.

[Graduale]
!Ex 15:11, 6
God is glorious in His Saints, wonderful in majesty, a worker of wonders.
V. Your right hand, O Lord, is magnificent in power; Your right hand has~
shattered the enemy. Alleluia, alleluia.
!Sir 44:14
V. The bodies of the Saints are buried in peace, but their name lives on and on.~

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 5:1-12
At that time, Jesus, seeing the crowds, went up the mountain. And when He was~
seated, His disciples came to Him. And opening His mouth He taught them, saying,~
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are~
they who mourn, for the shall be comforted. Blessed are they who hunger and~
thirst for justice, for they shall be satisfied. Blessed are the merciful, for~
they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall see God.~
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God. Blessed~
are they who suffer persecution for justice’ sake, for theirs is the kingdom of~
heaven. Blessed are you when men reproach you, and persecute you, and speaking~
falsely, say all manner of evil against you, for My sake. Rejoice and exult,~
because your reward is great in heaven.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 67:36
God is wonderful in His Saints; the God of Israel is He Who gives power and~
strength to His people. Blessed be God! Alleluia.

May this sacrificial gift, we beseech You, O Lord, which we offer in~
commemorating the anniversary of the death of Your Saints, both loose the bonds~
