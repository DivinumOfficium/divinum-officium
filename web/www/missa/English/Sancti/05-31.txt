!Eccli 24:5; 14:7; 14:9-11; 24:30-31
From the mouth of the Most High I came forth, the firstborn before all creatures. In the highest heavens did I dwell, my throne on a pillar cloud. Over all the land, over every people and nation I held sway, and by my power I have trodden under my feet the hearts of all the high and low. He who obeys me will not be put to shame, and they who work by me shall not sin. They who explain my shall have life everlasting.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 1:26-33
At that time, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee called~
Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph, of the house of David,~
and the virgin’s name was Mary. And when the angel had come to her, he said,~
Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women. When she~
had heard him she was troubled at his word, and kept pondering what manner of~
greeting this might be. And the angel said to her, Do not be afraid, Mary, for~
you have found grace with God. Behold, you shall conceive in your womb and shall~
bring forth a Son; and you shall call His name Jesus. He shall be great, and~
shall be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give Him the~
throne of David His father, and He shall be king over the house of Jacob forever;~
and of His kingdom there shall be no end.
