[Oratio]
O God, Who for us bring each year the recurrence of the consecration day of this~
Your holy temple, and always bring us back safely to the sacred rites, hear the~
prayers of Your people and grant that whoever enters this temple to pray for~
blessings, may rejoice in having obtained whatever he sought.
