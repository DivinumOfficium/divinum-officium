[Oratio]
O God, Who endowed St. Camillus with a special gift of charity for the help of souls struggling in their final agony, pour upon us, we beseech You, by his merits, the spirit of Your love, so that in the hour of our death we may be found worthy to overcome the enemy and attain the heavenly crown.

Through the prayers of St. Camillus may this spotless sacrificial offering, by which we renew the work of our Lord Jesus Christ’s infinite charity, be a healing remedy against all infirmities of body and soul and a consolation and protection in our last agony.

Through this heavenly food which we have received with holy devotion as we celebrate the feast of St. Camillus, Your Confessor, grant, we beseech You, O Lord, that in the hour of our death, strengthened by Your sacraments and absolved of all our sins, we may be found worthy to be taken up, rejoicing, into the bosom of Your mercy.
