Lesson from the first letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians
!1 Cor 13:1-8
Brethren: If I should speak with tongues of men and of angels, but do not have charity, I have become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal. And if I have prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains, yet do not have charity, I am nothing. And if I distribute all my goods to feed the poor, and if I deliver my body to be burned, yet do not have charity, it profits me nothing. Charity is patient, is kind; charity does not envy, is not pretentious, is not puffed up, is not ambitious, is not self-seeking, is not provoked; thinks no evil, does not rejoice over wickedness, but rejoices with the truth; bears with all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Charity never fails, whereas prophecies will disappear, and tongues will cease, and knowledge will be destroyed.

!Ecclus 11:13
V. The eye of God looks favorably upon him; He raises him free of the vile dust,~
and lifts up his head. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 22:1-14
 At that time, Jesus spoke to the chief priests and the Pharisees in parables,~
saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a king who made a marriage feast for his~
son. And he sent his servants to call in those invited to the marriage feast,~
but they would not come. Again he sent out other servants, saying, ‘Tell those~
who are invited, behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fatlings are~
killed, and everything is ready; come to the marriage feast.’ But they made~
light of it, and went off, one to his farm, and another to his business; and the~
rest laid hold of his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them. But~
when the king heard of it, he was angry; and he sent his armies, destroyed those~
murderers, and burnt their city. Then he said to his servants, ‘The marriage~
feast indeed is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy; go therefore~
to the crossroads, and invite to the marriage feast whomever you shall find.’~
And his servants went out into the roads, and gathered all whom they found, both~
good and bad; and the marriage feast was filled with guests. Now the king went~
in to see the guests, and he saw there a man who had not on a wedding garment.~
And he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding~
garment?’ But he was speechless. Then the king said to the attendants, ‘Bind his~
hands and feet and cast him forth into the darkness outside, where there will be~
the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.’ For many are called, but few are chosen.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 34:13
But as for me, when they were troublesome to me, I was clothed with haircloth,~
and I humbled my soul with fasting, and poured forth prayers within my bosom.
