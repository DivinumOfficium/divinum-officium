Lesson from the book of Revelation
!Rev 5:6-12
v. And I saw: and behold in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the ancients, a Lamb standing as it were slain, having seven horns and seven eyes: which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth. And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne. And when he had opened the book, the four living creatures, and the four and twenty ancients fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints: And they sung a new canticle, saying: Thou art worthy, O Lord, to take the book, and to open the seals thereof; because thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God, in thy blood, out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation. And hast made us to our God a kingdom and priests, and we shall reign on the earth. And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne, and the living creatures, and the ancients; and the number of them was thousands of thousands, Saying with a loud voice: The Lamb that was slain is worthy to receive power, and divinity, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and benediction.

!Ps 149:5; 149:1

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 6:17-23
v. And coming down with them, he stood in a plain place, and the company of his~
disciples, and a very great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem,~
and the sea coast both of Tyre and Sidon, Who were come to hear him, and to be~
healed of their diseases. And they that were troubled with unclean spirits, were~
cured. And all the multitude sought to touch him, for virtue went out from him,~
and healed all. And he, lifting up his eyes on his disciples, said: Blessed are~
ye poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. Blessed are ye that hunger now: for~
you shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for you shall laugh. Blessed~
shall you be when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you, and~
shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.~
Be glad in that day and rejoice; for behold, your reward is great in heaven. For~
according to these things did their fathers to the prophets.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 149:5-6
v. The saints shall rejoice in glory: they shall be joyful in their beds. The~
high praise of God shall be in their mouth: and two-edged swords in their hands:

[Secreta]
We load thy altar, O Lord, with the gifts we offer; grant we pray, that by the~

performed.
