Lesson from the book of Wisdom
!Wis 5:16-20
But the just live forever, and in the Lord is their recompense, and the thought of them is with the Most High. Therefore shall they receive the splendid kingdom and the beauteous diadem from the hand of the Lord - for He shall shelter them with His right hand, and protect them with His holy arm. He shall take His zeal for armor and He shall arm creation to requite the enemy; He shall don justice for a breastplate and shall wear sure judgment for a helmet; He shall take rectitude as an invincible shield.

[Graduale]
!Ps 33:18-19
When the just cry out, the Lord hears them, and from all their distress He~
rescues them.
V. The Lord is close to the brokenhearted, and those who are crushed in spirit~
He saves. Alleluia, alleluia.
V. This is the true brotherhood which overcame the wickedness of the world; it~
followed Christ, holding fast to the glorious heavenly kingdom. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 6:17-23
At that time, Jesus coming down from the mountain, took His stand on a level~
stretch, with a crowd of His disciples, and a great multitude of people from all~
Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to listen to~
Him and to be healed of their diseases. And those who were troubled with unclean~
spirits were cured. And all the crowd were trying to touch Him, for power went~
forth from Him and healed all. And He lifted up His eyes to His disciples, and~
said, Blessed are you poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. Blessed are you who~
hunger now, for you shall be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you~
shall laugh. Blessed shall you be when men hate you, and when they shut you out,~
and reproach you, and reject your name as evil, because of the Son of Man.~
Rejoice on that day and exult, for behold your reward is great in heaven.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 5:12-13
All who love Your name shall glory in You, for You, O Lord, bless the just man; O~
Lord, You surround us with the shield of Your good will.

[Secreta]
Let not the gracious prayer of Your saints fail us, O Lord, but may it make our~
offerings acceptable to You and obtain for us your mercy.
