Lesson from the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews
!Heb 11:33-39
Brethren: The Saints by faith conquered kingdoms, wrought justice, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, recovered strength from weakness, became valiant in battle, put to flight armies of aliens. Women had their dead restored to them by resurrection. Others were tortured, refusing to accept release, that they might find a better resurrection. Others had experience of mockery and stripes, yes, even of chains and prisons. They were stoned, they were sawed asunder, they were tempted, they were put to death by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, distressed, afflicted - of whom the world was not worthy - wandering in deserts, mountains, caves and holes in the earth. And all these, approved by the testimony of faith, were found in Christ Jesus our Lord.

[Graduale]
!Ex 15:11
God is glorious in His Saints, wonderful in majesty, a worker of wonders.
!Ex 15:6
V. Your right hand, O Lord, is magnificent in power; Your right hand, O Lord,~
has shattered the enemy. 
Alleluia, alleluia.
!Ps 144:10-11
Let Your faithful ones bless You, O Lord. Let them discourse of the glory of~
Your kingdom. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 6:17-23
At that time, Jesus coming down from the mountain, took His stand on a level~
stretch, with a crowd of His disciples, and a great multitude of people from all~
Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to listen to~
Him and to be healed of their diseases. And those who were troubled with unclean~
spirits were cured. And all the crowd were trying to touch Him, for power went~
forth from Him and healed all. And He lifted up His eyes to His disciples, and~
said, Blessed are you poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. Blessed are you who~
hunger now, for you shall be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you~
shall laugh. Blessed shall you be when men hate you, and when they shut you out,~
and reproach you, and reject your name as evil, because of the Son of Man.~
Rejoice on that day and exult, for behold your reward is great in heaven.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 31:11
Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, you just; exult, all you upright of heart.
