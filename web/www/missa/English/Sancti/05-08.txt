Lesson from the book of Revelation
!Rev 1:1-5
In those days God signified the things which must shortly come to pass: and signified, sending by his angel to his servant John, Who hath given testimony to the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ, what things soever he hath seen. Blessed is he, that readeth and heareth the words of this prophecy; and keepeth those things which are written in it; for the time is at hand. John to the seven churches which are in Asia. Grace be unto you and peace from him that is, and that was, and that is to come, and from the seven spirits which are before his throne, And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth, who hath loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,

V. The sea was shaken and the earth trembled when archangel Michael came down~
from heaven. Alleluja.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 18:1-10
In that time: the disciples came to Jesus, saying: Who thinkest thou is the~
greater in the kingdom of heaven? And Jesus calling unto him a little child, set~
him in the midst of them, And said: Amen I say to you, unless you be converted,~
and become as little children, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.~
Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, he is the greater~
in the kingdom of heaven. And he that shall receive one such little child in my~
name, receiveth me. But he that shall scandalize one of these little ones that~
believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone should be hanged about~
his neck, and that he should be drowned in the depth of the sea. Woe to the~
world because of scandals. For it must needs be that scandals come: but~
nevertheless woe to that man by whom the scandal cometh. And if thy hand, or thy~
foot scandalize thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee. It is better for thee~
to go into life maimed or lame, than having two hands or two feet, to be cast~
into everlasting fire. And if thy eye scandalize thee, pluck it out, and cast it~
from thee. It is better for thee having one eye to enter into life, than having~
two eyes to be cast into hell fire. See that you despise not one of these little~
ones: for I say to you, that their angels in heaven always see the face of my~
Father who is in heaven.

[Offertorium]
!Rev 8:3; 8:4
v. An angel stood before the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given~
to him much incense. And the smoke of the incense of the prayers of the saints~
ascended up before God, allelúja.

[Secreta]
We offer thee a sacrifice of praise, O Lord, and humbly beseech thee that,~
through the prayers of the Angels, who plead for us, thou woulds be appeased~
and wouldst receive it, and grant, that it may awail us unto salvation.

!Dan 3:58
v. O ye angels of the Lord, bless the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for~
ever, alleluja.

[Postcommunio]
Relaying on the intercession of blessed Michael the archangel, we humbly entreat~
thee, O Lord, that the service we pray with our lips, we may lay hold of with~
our minds.
