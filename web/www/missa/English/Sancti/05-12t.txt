Lesson from the book of Wisdom
!Wis 5:1-5.
The just shall stand with great assurance before their oppressors who set at nought their labors. Seeing this, these shall be shaken with dreadful fear, and amazed at the suddenness of the unlooked-for salvation. They shall say among themselves, rueful and groaning through anguish of spirit: These are they whom once we held as a laughingstock and as a type for mockery, fools that we were! Their life we deemed madness, and their death dishonored. See how they are accounted among the sons of God; how their lot is with the Saints!

[Graduale]
Alleluia, alleluia.
V. This is the true brotherhood, which overcame the wickedness of the world; it~
followed Christ, attaining the noble kingdom of heaven. Alleluia.
V. The white-robed army of Martyrs praises You, O Lord. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 4:46-53.
At that time, there was a certain royal official whose son was lying sick at~
Capharnaum. When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, he went~
to him and besought Him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point~
of death. Jesus therefore said to him, Unless you see signs and wonders, you do~
not believe. The royal official said to Him, Sir, come down before my child~
dies. Jesus said to him, Go your way, your son lives. The man believed the word~
that Jesus spoke to him, and departed. But even as he was now going down, his~
servants met him and brought word saying that his son lived. He asked of them~
therefore the hour in which he had got better. And they told him, Yesterday, at~
the seventh hour, the fever left him. The father knew then that it was at that~
very hour in which Jesus had said to him, Your son lives. And he himself~
believed, and his whole household.
