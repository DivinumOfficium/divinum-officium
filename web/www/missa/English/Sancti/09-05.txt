Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus
!Ecclus 44:16-27; 45:3-20
Behold, a great priest, who in his days pleased God, and was found just; and in the time of wrath he was made a reconciliation. There was not found the like to him, who kept the law of the Most High. Therefore, by an oath, the Lord made him to increase among his people. He gave him the blessing of all nations, and confirmed His covenant upon his head. He acknowledged him in His blessings; He preserved for him His mercy; and he found grace before the eyes of the Lord. He glorified him in the sight of kings, and gave him a crown of glory. He made an everlasting covenant with him, and gave him a great priesthood; and made him blessed in glory. To execute the office of the priesthood, and to have praise in His name, and to offer Him a worthy incense for an odor of sweetness.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 25:14-23
At that time, Jesus spoke this parable to His disciples: A man going abroad,~
called his servants and handed over his goods to them. And to one he gave five~
talents, to another two, and to another one, to each according to his particular~
ability, and then he went on his journey. And he who had received the five~
talents went and traded with them, and gained five more. In like manner, he who~
had received the two gained two more. But he who had received the one went away~
and dug in the earth and hid his master’s money. Then after a long time the~
master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. And he who had~
received the five talents came and brought five other talents, saying, ‘Master,~
you handed over to me five talents; behold, I have gained five others in~
addition.’ His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant;~
because you have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many; enter~
into the joy of your master.’ And he also who had received the two talents came,~
and said, ‘Master, you handed over to me two talents; behold, I have gained two~
more.’ His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant; because~
you have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many; enter into~
the joy of your master.’

I have found David, My servant; with My holy oil I have anointed him, that My~
