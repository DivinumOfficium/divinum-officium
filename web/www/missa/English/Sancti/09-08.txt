Lesson from the book of Proverbs
!Prov 8:22-35
The Lord begot me, the firstborn of His ways, the forerunner of His prodigies of long ago; from of old I was poured forth, at the first, before the earth. When there were not depths I was brought forth, when there were not fountains or springs of water; before the mountains were settled into place, before the hills, I was brought forth; while as yet the earth and the fields were not made, nor the first clods of the world. When He established the heavens I was there, when He marked out the vault over the face of the deep; when He made firm the skies above, and poised the fountains of waters; when He set for the sea its limit, so that the waters should not transgress His command; when He fixed fast the foundations of the earth, then was I beside Him as His craftsman, and I was His delight day by day, playing before Him all the while, playing on the surface of His earth and I found delight in the sons of men. So now, O children, listen to me; happy those who keep my ways. Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not. Happy the man who obeys me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at my doorsteps; for he who finds me finds life, and wins favor from the Lord.

[Graduale]
Blessed and venerable are you, O Virgin Mary, who, without spot to your~
maidenhood, were made the Mother of the Saviour.
V. O Virgin, Mother of God, He Whom the whole world cannot contain, enclosed~
Himself in your womb, becoming Man. Alleluia, alleluia.
V. Happy are you, O Holy Virgin Mary, and most worthy of all high praise; for~
out of you has risen the sun of justice, Christ our God. Alleluia.
