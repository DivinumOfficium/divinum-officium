[Lectio]
Lesson from the first letter of St. Peter the Apostle
!1 Pet 1:1-7
v. Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers dispersed through Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, elect, According to the foreknowledge of God the Father, unto the sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you and peace be multiplied. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy hath regenerated us unto a lively hope, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, unto an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that can not fade, reserved in heaven for you, Who, by the power of God, are kept by faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time. Wherein you shall greatly rejoice, if now you must be for a little time made sorrowful in divers temptations: That the trial of your faith - much more precious than gold which is tried by the fire - may be found unto praise and glory and honour at the appearing of Jesus Christ.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 16:13-19
v. And Jesus came into the quarters of Cesarea Philippi: and he asked his~
disciples, saying: Whom do men say that the Son of man is? But they said: Some~
John the Baptist, and other some Elias, and others Jeremias, or one of the~
prophets. Jesus saith to them: But whom do you say that I am? Simon Peter~
answered and said: Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus~
answering, said to him: Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jona: because flesh and~
blood hath not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in heaven. And I say to~
thee: That thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will build My Church, and the~
gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give to thee the keys of~
the kingdom of heaven. And whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth, it shall be~
bound also in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose upon earth, it shall be~
loosed also in heaven.
