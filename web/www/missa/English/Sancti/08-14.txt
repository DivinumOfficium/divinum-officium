[Lectio]
Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus
!Ecclus 24:23-31
I bud forth delights like the vine, my blossoms become fruit fair and rich. I am the mother of fair love, and of fear, and of knowledge, and of holy hope. In me is all grace of the way and of the truth, in me is all hope of life and of virtue. Come to me, all you that yearn for me, and be filled with my fruits; for my spirit is sweeter than honey, and my inheritance better to have than honey and the honeycomb. My memory is to everlasting generations. They who eat of me will hunger still, and they who drink of me will thirst for more. He who obeys me will not be put to shame, they who serve me will never fail. They who explain me shall have life everlasting.

[Graduale]
!  
V. Blessed and venerable are you, O Virgin Mary, who, without spot were made the~
Mother of the Saviour.
V. O Virgin, Mother of God, He Whom the whole world cannot contain, shut Himself~
in your womb, becoming Man.

[Offertorium]
!  
Blessed are you, O Virgin Mary, you who bore the Creator of all things; you~
brought forth Him Who made you, and you remain a Virgin forever.

[Secreta]
O Lord, may the prayer of the Mother of God, recommend our offerings to Your~
mercy, that she, whom You transported from this world, may trustingly intercede~
for our sins in Your presence.

[Postcommunio]

to the feast of God’s holy Mother, may, through the help of her intercession,~
rise from the depths of our sins.
