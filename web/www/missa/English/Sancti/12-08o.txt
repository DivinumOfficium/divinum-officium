[Oratio]
O God, Who by the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin, prepared a worthy~
dwelling for Your Son, and Who, by Your Son’s death, foreseen by You, preserved~
her from all taint, grant, we beseech You, through her intercession, that we too~
may come to You unstained by sin.
$Per Dominum

[Secreta]
Accept, O Lord, the sacrifice of salvation which we offer You on the feast of~
the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary; and grant that as we~
profess that she was kept from all taint of evil, by Your anticipating grace, so,~
through her intercession, may we be freed from all sin.
$Per Dominum

[Postcommunio]
May the sacrament we have received, O Lord our God, heal in us the wounds of~
that sin from which by a singular privilege, You kept immaculate the conception~
of blessed Mary.
