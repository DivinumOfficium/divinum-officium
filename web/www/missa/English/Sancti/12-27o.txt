[Lectio]
Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus
!Ecclus 15:1-6
He who fears God will do good; he who is practiced in the Law will come to wisdom. Like an honorable mother she will meet him, nourish him with the bread of life and understanding, and give him the water of learning to drink. She will be made strong in him, and he shall not be moved; she will hold him fast, and he shall not be put to shame. She will exalt him above his fellows; in the midst of the assembly she will open his mouth, and will fill him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding, and will clothe him with a robe of glory. The Lord our God will heap upon him a treasure of joy and gladness, and will cause him to inherit an everlasting name.

Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 21:19-24
At that time, Jesus said to Peter, Follow Me. Turning around, Peter saw~
following them the disciple whom Jesus loved, the one who, at the supper, had~
leaned back upon His breast and said, Lord, who is it that will betray You?~
Peter therefore, seeing him, said to Jesus, Lord, and what of this man? Jesus~
said to him, If I wish him to remain until I come, what is it to you? You,~
follow Me. This saying therefore went abroad among the brethren, that that~
disciple was not to die. But Jesus had not said to him, He is not to die; but~
rather, If I wish him to remain until I come, what is it to you? This is the~
disciple who bears witness concerning these things, and who has written these~
things, and we know that his witness is true.

PREFACE OF THE NATIVITY It is indeed right and just, it is proper and helpful~
for salvation always and everywhere to give thanks to You, O Lord, holy Father,~
almighty and eternal God, for by the mystery of the Word made flesh, a new light~
of Your splendor has shone before the eyes of our mind, so that, while we~
perceive God in visible form, through Him, may we be transported to love of~
things invisible. And therefore with the angels and archangels, with thrones~
and dominations, and with all the heavenly host, we sing a hymn to Your glory,~
evermore acclaiming: Holy, holy, holy. . .
