[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 21:19-24
At that time, Jesus said to Peter, Follow Me. Turning around, Peter saw following them the disciple whom Jesus loved, the one who, at the supper, had leaned back upon His breast and said, Lord, who is it that will betray You? Peter therefore, seeing him, said to Jesus, Lord, and what of this man? Jesus said to him, If I wish him to remain until I come, what is it to you? You, follow Me. This saying therefore went abroad among the brethren, that that disciple was not to die. But Jesus had not said to him, He is not to die; but rather, If I wish him to remain until I come, what is it to you? This is the disciple who bears witness concerning these things, and who has written these things, and we know that his witness is true.
