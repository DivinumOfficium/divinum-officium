Lesson from the book of Wisdom
!Wis 10:10-14
The Lord guided the just in direct ways, showed him the kingdom of God, and gave him knowledge of holy things; He prospered him in his labors and made abundant the fruit of his works, stood by him against the greed of his defrauders, and enriched him; He preserved him from foes, and secured him against ambush, and He gave him the prize for his stern struggle that he might recognize that devotion to God is mightier than all else. He did not abandon the just man when he was sold, but delivered him from sin. He went down with him into the dungeon, and did not desert him in his bonds, until He brought him the scepter of royalty and authority over his oppressors, and showed those who had defamed him false; and the Lord our God gave him eternal glory.

[Graduale]
!Ps 36:30-31
The mouth of the just tells of wisdom, and his tongue utters what is right.
V. The law of his God is in his heart, and his steps do not falter. Alleluia,~
alleluia.
!James 1:12
V. Blessed is the man who endures temptation; for when he has been tried, he~
will receive the crown of life. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 18:1-5
At that time, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the~
kingdom of heaven? And Jesus called a little child to Him, set him in their~
midst, and said, Amen I say to you, unless you turn and become like little~
children, you will not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whoever, therefore,~
humbles himself as this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of~
heaven. And whoever receives one such little child for My sake, receives Me.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 9:17
The desire of the afflicted the Lord hears; You pay heed to the strengthening of~
their hearts.

[Secreta]
Upon Your altar we heap our offerings, O Lord, that they may win mercy for us~
through the prayer of him whom You have given to help us.

ever greater degree of holiness.
