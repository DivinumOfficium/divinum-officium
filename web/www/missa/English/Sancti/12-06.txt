Lesson from the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews
!Heb 13:7-17
Brethren: Remember your superiors, who spoke to you the word of God. Consider how they ended their lives, and imitate their faith. Jesus Christ is the same, yesterday and today, yes, and forever. Do not be led away by various and strange doctrines. For it is good to make steadfast the heart by grace, not by foods, in which those who walked found no profit. We have an altar, from which they have no right to eat who serve the tabernacle. For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the Holies by the high priest for sin, are burned outside the camp; and so Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people by His Blood, suffered outside the gate. Let us therefore go forth to Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach; for here we have no permanent city, but we seek for the city that is to come. Through Him, therefore, let us offer up a sacrifice of praise always to God, that is, fruit of lips praising His name. And do not forget kindness and charity, for by such sacrifices God’s favor is obtained. Obey your superiors and be subject to them, for they keep watch as having to render an account of your souls.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 25:14-23
At that time, Jesus spoke this parable to His disciples: A man going abroad,~
called his servants and handed over his goods to them. And to one he gave five~
talents, to another two, and to another one, to each according to his particular~
ability, and then he went on his journey. And he who had received the five~
talents went and traded with them, and gained five more. In like manner, he who~
had received the two gained two more. But he who had received the one went away~
and dug in the earth and hid his master’s money. Then after a long time the~
master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. And he who had~
received the five talents came and brought five other talents, saying, ‘Master,~
you handed over to me five talents; behold, I have gained five others in~
addition.’ His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant;~
because you have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many;~
enter into the joy of your master.’ And he also who had received the two talents~
came and said, ‘Master, you handed over to me two talents; behold, I have gained~
two more.’ His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant;~
because you have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many;~
enter into the joy of your master.’

My faithfulness and My kindness shall be with him, and through My name shall his~
horn be exalted.
