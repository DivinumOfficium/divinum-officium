[Sequentia]
!May be omitted at Daily Mass
Dreaded day, that day of ire,
When the world shall melt in fire,
Told by Sibyl and David’s lyre.
_
Fright men’s hearts shall rudely shift,
As the Judge through gleaming rift
Comes each soul to closely sift.
_
Then, the trumpet’s shrill refrain,
Piercing tombs by hill and plain,
Souls to judgment shall arraign.
_
Death and nature stand aghast,
As the bodies rising fast,
Hie to hear the sentence passed.
_
Then, before Him shall be placed,
That whereon the verdict’s based,
Book wherein each deed is traced.
_
When the Judge His seat shall gain,
All that’s hidden shall be plain,
Nothing shall unjudged remain.
_
Wretched man, what can I plead?
Whom to ask to intercede,
When the just much mercy need?
_
You, O awe-inspiring Lord,
Saving e’en when unimplored,
Save me, mercy’s fount adored.
_
O sweet Jesus, mindful be,
That You came on earth for me:
Cast me not from You this day.
_
Seeking me Your strength was spent
Ransoming Your limbs were rent:
Is this toil to no intent?
_
You, awarding pains condign,
Mercy’s ear to me incline,
Ere the reckoning You assign.
_
I, felon-like, my lot bewail,
Suffused cheeks my shame unveil:
God! O let my prayer prevail.
_
Mary’s soul You fashioned white,
And did to heaven the thief invite;
Hope in me these now excite.
_
Prayers of mine in vain ascend:
You are good and will forefend,
In quenchless fire my life to end.
_
When the cursed by shame oppressed,
Enter flames at Your behest,
Call me then to join the blessed.
_
Place amid Your sheep accord,
Keep me from the tainted horde,
Set me in Your sight, O Lord.
_
Prostrate, suppliant, now no more
Unrepenting, as of yore,
Save me dying, I implore.
_
Mournful day that day of sighs,
When from dust shall man arise,
Stained with guilt his doom to know,
_
Mercy, Lord, on him bestow.
Jesus, kind! Your souls release,
Led them thence to realms of peace.
Amen.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 6:51-55.
At that time, Jesus said to the multitudes of the Jews, I am the living bread~
that has come down from heaven. If anyone eat of this bread he shall live~
forever; and the bread that I will give is My Flesh for the life of the world.~
The Jews on that account argued with one another, saying, How can this man give~
us His Flesh to eat? Jesus therefore said to them, Amen, amen, I say to you,~
unless you eat the Flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His Blood, you shall not~
have life in you. He who eats My Flesh and drinks My Blood has life everlasting~
and I will raise him up on the last day.

[Offertorium]
O Lord, Jesus Christ, King of glory, deliver the souls of all the~
faithful departed from the pains of hell and the deep pit; deliver them from the~
lion’s mouth, that hell engulf them not, nor they fall into darkness, but that~
Michael, the holy standard-bearer, bring them into the holy light * which You~
once promised to Abraham and his seed.
V. We offer You, O Lord, sacrifices and prayers of praise; accept them for those~
souls whom we this day commemorate; grant them, O Lord, to pass from death to~
the life * which You once promised to Abraham and his seed.

[Secreta]
Look mercifully, we beseech You, O Lord, upon the sacrificial gifts we offer You~
for the souls of Your servants and handmaids; and since You have given them the~
merit of Christian faith, also grant them its reward.
$Per Dominum

[Communio]
!4 Esdr 2:35; 2:34
May light eternal shine upon them, O Lord, with Your Saints forever, for You are~
kind.
V. Grant them eternal rest, O Lord; and let perpetual light shine upon them:~
with Your Saints forever, for You are kind.

[Postcommunio]
May the prayers of Your suppliants be helpful to the souls of Your servants and~
handmaids, we beseech You, O Lord, that You may free them from all sin and make~
them sharers in Your redemption.
