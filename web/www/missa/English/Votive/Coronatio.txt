[Lectio]
Lesson from the first letter of St Peter the Apostle
!1 Pet 1:1-7
Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the sojourners of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, chosen unto the sanctification of the Spirit according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, unto obedience to Jesus Christ and the sprinkling of His blood: grace and peace be given you in abundance. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who according to His great mercy has begotten us again, through the Resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, unto a living hope, unto an incorruptible inheritance - undefiled and unfading, reserved for you in heaven. By the power of God you are guarded through faith for salvation, which is ready to be revealed in the last time. Over this you rejoice; though now for a little while, if need be, you are made sorrowful by various trials, that the temper of your faith - more precious by far than gold which is tried by fire - may be found unto praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ our Lord.

Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 16:13-19
At that time, Jesus, having come into the district of Caesarea Philippi, began~
to ask His disciples, saying, Who do men say the Son of Man is? But they said,~
Some say, John the Baptist; and others, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of~
the prophets. He said to them, But who do you say that I am? Simon Peter~
answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God. Then Jesus~
answered and said, Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jona, for flesh and blood has not~
revealed this to you, but My Father in heaven; and whatever you shall bind on~
earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you shall loose on earth shall be~
loosed in heaven.
