Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus
!Sir 51:13-17.
O Lord, my God, You have exalted my dwelling place upon the earth, and I have prayed for death to pass away. I called upon the Lord, the Father of my Lord, that He would not abandon me in the day of my trouble, and in the time of the proud without help. I will ever praise Your name, and will praise it with thanksgiving; and my prayer was heard. And You saved me from destruction, and delivered me from the evil time. For this reason I thank You and I praise You, O Lord, our God.

[Evangelium]
Continuation ++ of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 13:44-52.
At that time, Jesus spoke this parable to His disciples: The kingdom of heaven~
is like a treasure hidden in a field; he who finds it hides it, and in his joy~
goes and sells all that he has and buys that field. Again, the kingdom of heaven~
is like a merchant in search of fine pearls. When he finds a single pearl of~
great price, he goes and sells all that he has and buys it. Again, the kingdom~
of heaven is like a net cast into the sea that gathered in fish of every kind.~
When it was filled, they hauled it out, and sitting down on the beach, they~
gathered the good fish into vessels, but threw away the bad. So will it be at~
the end of the world. The angels will go out and separate the wicked from among~
the just, and will cast them into the furnace of fire, where there will be the~
weeping, and the gnashing of teeth. Have you understood all these things? They~
said to Him, Yes. And He said to them, So then, every Scribe instructed in the~
kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings forth from his storeroom~
things new and old.

Martyr, we may forevermore abide in its participation.

[Evangelium1]
Continuation ++ of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 19:3-12.
At that time, there came to Jesus some Pharisees, testing Him, and saying, Is it~
lawful for a man to put away his wife for any cause? But He answered and said to~
them, Have you not read that the Creator, from the beginning, made them male and~
female, and said, ‘For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother, and~
cleave to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh’? Therefore now they are~
no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let no man~
put asunder. They said to Him, Why then did Moses command to give a written~
notice of dismissal, and to put her away? He said to them, Because Moses, by~
reason of the hardness of your heart, permitted you to put away your wives; but~
it was not so from the beginning. And I say to you, that whoever puts away his~
wife, except for immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and he who~
marries a woman who has been put away commits adultery. His disciples said to~
Him, If the case of a man with his wife is so, it is not expedient to marry. And~
He said, Not all can accept this teaching; but those to whom it has been given.~
For there are eunuchs who were born so from their mother’s womb; and there are~
eunuchs who were made so by men; and there are eunuchs who have made themselves~
so for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let him accept it who can.
