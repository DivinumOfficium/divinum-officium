[Lectio]
Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Jews
!Heb 7:23-27
Brethren: The priests were numerous, because they were prevented by death~
from continuing in office; but Jesus, because he continues forever, has an~
everlasting priesthood. Therefore He is able at all times to save those who~
come to God through Him, since He lives always to make intercession for~
them. For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy,~
innocent, undefiled, set apart from sinners, and become higher than the~
heavens. He does not need to offer sacrifices daily - as the other priests~
did - first for His own sins, and then for the sins of the people; for this~
latter He did once for all in offering up Himself, Jesus Christ our Lord.

[Graduale]
!Ps 131:16-17
Her priests I will clothe salvation, and her faithful ones shall shout merrily~
for joy.
V. In her will I make a horn to sprout forth for David; I will place a lamp for~
My anointed. Alleluia, alleluia.
!Ps 109:4
The Lord has sworn, and He will not repent: You are a priest forever, according~
to the order of Melchisedec. Alleluia.

[Tractus]

Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord: he shall delight exceedingly in his commandments.
V. His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the righteous shall be blessed.
V. Glory and wealth shall be in his house: and his justice remaineth for ever and ever.

[GradualeP]

[Evangelium]
Continuation ++ of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 24:42-47.
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples, "Watch, for you do not know at what~
hour your Lord is to come. But of this be assured, that if the householder had~
known at what hour the thief was coming, he would certainly have watched, and~
not have let his house be broken into. Therefore you also must be ready, because~
at an hour that you do not expect, the Son of Man will come. Who, do you think,~
is the faithful and prudent servant whom his master has set over his household~
to give them their food in due time? Blessed is that servant whom his master,~
when he comes, shall find so doing. Amen I say to you, he will set him over all~
his goods."

[Secreta]
