Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus
!Sir 24:14-16
Before all ages, in the beginning, He created me, and through all ages I shall not cease to be. In the holy Tent I ministered before Him, and in Sion I fixed my abode. Thus in the chosen city He has given me rest, in Jerusalem is my domain. I have struck root among the glorious people, in the portion of my God, His heritage, and my abode is in the full assembly of Saints.

!Num 17:8
The rod of Jesse has blossomed: a Virgin has brought forth God and man: God has~
given peace, reconciling in Himself the lowest with the highest. Alleluia.

At that time, as Jesus was speaking to the multitudes, a certain woman from the~

the word of God and keep it.
