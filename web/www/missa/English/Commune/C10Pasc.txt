!Sir 24:14-16
v.  From the beginning, and before the world, was I created, and unto the world to come I shall not cease to be, and in the holy dwelling place I have ministered before him.

And I took root in an honourable people, and in the portion of my God his inheritance, and my abode is in the full assembly of saints.

And from that hour, the disciple took her to his own.
