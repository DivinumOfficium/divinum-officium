[Lectio]
Lesson from the second letter of St Paul the Apostle to Timothy
!2 Tim 4:1-8
v. Dearly beloved: I charge thee, before God and Jesus Christ, who~
shall judge the living and the dead, by his coming, and his kingdom:~
Preach the word: be instant in season, out of season: reprove,~
entreat, rebuke in all patience and doctrine. For there shall be a~
time, when they will not endure sound doctrine; but, according to~
their own desires, they will heap to themselves teachers, having~
itching ears: And will indeed turn away their hearing from the truth,~
but will be turned unto fables. But be thou vigilant, labour in all~
things, do the work of an evangelist, fulfil thy ministry. Be sober.~
For I am even now ready to be sacrificed: and the time of my~
dissolution is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my~
course, I have kept the faith. As to the rest, there is laid up for me~
a crown of justice, which the Lord the just judge will render to me in~
that day: and not only to me, but to them also that love his coming.

[Evangelium]
Continuation ++ of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 5:13-19
v.  In that time Jesus said to His disciples: You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt lose its savour, wherewith shall it be salted? It is good for nothing any more but to be cast out, and to be trodden on by men. You are the light of the world. A city seated on a mountain cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, but upon a candlestick, that it may shine to all that are in the house. So let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven. Do not think that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets. I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill. For amen I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, one jot, or one tittle shall not pass of the law, till all be fulfilled. He therefore that shall break one of these least commandments, and shall so teach men, shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. But he that shall do and teach, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 91:13
v.  The just shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow up like the cedar of Libanus.
