Lesson from the book of Wisdom
!Wis 5:16-20
v. But the just shall live for evermore: and their reward is with the Lord, and the care of them with the most High. Therefore shall they receive a kingdom of glory, and a crown of beauty at the hand of the Lord: for with his right hand he will cover them, and with his holy arm he will defend them. And his zeal will take armour, and he will arm the creature for the revenge of his enemies. He will put on justice as a breastplate, and will take true judgment instead of a helmet. He will take equity for an invincible shield:

[Evangelium]
Continuation ++ of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 6:17-23
v. And coming down with them, he stood in a plain place, and the company of his~
disciples, and a very great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem,~
and the sea coast both of Tyre and Sidon, Who were come to hear him, and to be~
healed of their diseases. And they that were troubled with unclean spirits, were~
cured. And all the multitude sought to touch him, for virtue went out from him,~
and healed all. And he, lifting up his eyes on his disciples, said: Blessed are~
ye poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. Blessed are ye that hunger now: for~
you shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for you shall laugh. Blessed~
shall you be when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you, and~
shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.~
Be glad in that day and rejoice; for behold, your reward is great in heaven. For~
according to these things did their fathers to the prophets.
