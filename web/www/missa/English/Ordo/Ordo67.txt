!In Solemn Masses the priest blesses the incense, and the deacon, kneeling before the altar with his hands joined, says the Munda cor. 
Cleanse my heart and my lips, O almighty God, who didst cleanse the lips of the prophet Isaias with a burning coal, and vouchsafe, through Thy gracious mercy, so to purify me, that I may worthily announce Thy holy Gospel. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.

# Creed
!*&Credo
![:1965=May be sung or recited by the faithful in vernacular:]
!On Sundays and certain Feasts the priest recites the Creed, a summary of the Catholic Doctrine. This profession of faith was drawn up in the General Councils of Nice in 325 and Constantinople in 381 to condemn heretics who denied that Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost were God.
v. I believe in one God, the Father almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things, visible and invisible. 
And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God. And born of the Father, before all ages. God of God: Light of Light: true God of true God. Begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father, by whom all things were made. Who, for us men, and for our salvation, came down from heaven. (bows) And became incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin Mary: and was made man. He was crucified also for us, suffered under Pontius Pilate, and was buried. And the third day He rose again according to the Scriptures. And ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father. And He shall come again with glory to judge both the living and the dead, of whose kingdom there shall be no end. 
And in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of Life, proceeding from the Father and the Son. Who together, with the Father and the Son, is adored and glorified: Who spoke by the prophets. And in one, holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church. I confess one baptism for the remission of sins. And I look for the resurrection of the dead. And the life of the world to come. Amen. 	

# Offertory
!The priest turning to the people says:
P. The Lord be with you. 	
S. And with thy spirit. 	
!After saluting the people once more, the priest enters upon the Sacrifice of the Mass proper and urges the faithful to pray with him.
v. Let us pray.
![:1965=Universal prayer or prayer of the faithful is lead by the celebrant either at his chair, the altar, the lectern or the edge of the sanctuary:]
_
![:1965=The celebrant is not to say privately those parts sung or recited by the Choir or congregation; he may sing or recite along:]
&offertorium 	

!Then the priest reads the Offertory-verse, a short quotation from Holy Scripture which varies with the Mass of each day. This being finished, he offers the bread and wine, which, by virtue of the words of consecration, he is going to change into the adorable Body and Blood of Jesus Christ. He takes the paten with the host and offering it up, says:
v. Accept, O holy Father, almighty and eternal God, this unspotted host, which I, Thy unworthy servant, offer unto Thee, my living and true God, for my innumerable sins, offenses, and negligences, and for all here present: as also for all faithful Christians, both living and dead, that it may avail both me and them for salvation unto life everlasting. Amen. 	

!Making the Sign of the Cross with the paten, he places the host upon the corporal. He pours wine and water into the chalice, blessing the water before it is mixed. He pours a few drops of water into the chalice containing wine, in remembrance of the water and blood which flowed from the side of Jesus when pierced by the soldier's lance.
v. O God, who, in creating human nature, didst wonderfully dignify it, and still more wonderfully restore it, grant that, by the Mystery of this water and wine, we may be made partakers of His divine nature, who vouchsafed to be made partaker of our human nature, even Jesus Christ our Lord, Thy Son, who with Thee, liveth and reigneth in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God: world without end. Amen. 	

!*D
!In Masses for the Dead, the foregoing prayer is said, but the water is not blessed.

!Then the priest takes the chalice, and offers it, saying:
v. We offer unto Thee, O Lord, the chalice of salvation, beseeching Thy clemency, that it may ascend before Thy divine Majesty, as a sweet savor, for our salvation, and for that of the whole world. Amen. 	
!The priest makes the Sign of the Cross with the chalice, places it upon the corporal, and covers it with the pall. Then, with his hands joined upon the Altar, and slightly bowing down, he says:
v. Accept us, O Lord, in the spirit of humility and contrition of heart, and grant that the sacrifice which we offer this day in Thy sight may be pleasing to Thee, O Lord God. 	
!Raising his eyes towards heaven, extending and then joining his hands, the priest makes the Sign of the Cross over the host and the chalice, while he invokes the Holy Spirit.
v. Come, O almighty and eternal God, the Sanctifier, and bless + this Sacrifice, prepared for the glory of Thy holy Name. 	

!*S
# Incense
!At Solemn Masses, the priest now blesses incense, saying the following prayers:
v. May the Lord, by the intercession of blessed Michael the Archangel, who standeth at the right side of the altar of incense, and of all His Elect, vouchsafe to bless + this incense and receive it as an odor of sweetness: through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. 	
!Receiving the thurible from the deacon, the priest incenses the bread and the wine, while he says:
v. May this incense, which Thou hast blessed, O Lord, ascend to Thee, and may Thy mercy descend upon us. 	
!Then he incenses the altar, saying:
!Ps. 140, 2-4. 
v. Let my prayer, O Lord, be directed as incense in Thy sight: the lifting up of my hands as an evening sacrifice. 	
Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth, and a door round about my lips. May my heart not incline to evil words, to make excuses for sins. 	
!Giving the censor to the deacon, he says:
v. May the Lord enkindle within us the fire of His love, and the flame of everlasting charity. Amen. 	
!The priest is then incensed by the deacon, who then incenses the others in order.

!The priest washes his fingers to symbolize the great purity and inner cleanliness of those who offer or participate in this great Sacrifice.
!Psalm 25. 6-12
I will wash my hands among the innocent: and I will compass Thine altar, O Lord That I may hear the voice of praise: and tell of all Thy wonderous works. I have loved, O Lord, the beauty of Thy house and the place where Thy glory dwelleth. Take not away my soul, O God, with the wicked: nor my life with blood-thirsty men. In whose hands are iniquities, their right hand is filled with gifts. But I have walked in my innocence: redeem me, and have mercy on me. My foot hath stood in the direct way, in the churches I will bless Thee, O Lord. 	
&Gloria

!Bowing down before the middle of the alter, the priest, with joined hands, says:
v. Receive, O holy Trinity, this oblation which we make to Thee, in memory of the Passion, Resurrection and Ascension of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in honor of Blessed Mary, ever Virgin, blessed John the Baptist, the holy Apostles Peter and Paul, and of all the Saints, that it may avail unto their honor and our salvation, and may they vouchsafe to intercede for us in heaven, whose memory we celebrate on earth. Through the same Christ our Lord. Amen. 	

!The priest turning towards the people, extending, then joining his hands, says audibly:
P. Brethren, pray that my Sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the Father almighty. 	
!The server answers:
S. May the Lord receive the Sacrifice from thy hands, to the praise and glory of His Name, to our benefit and that of all His holy Church. 	
!The priest answers in a low voice:
P. Amen. 	
!Then, with outstretched hands, he recites the Secret Prayers, not beginning with Oremus. The Secret Prayers vary with the Mass, and are found in the Mass of the Day. These being finished, the priest says or sings: P. World without end. S. Amen.

# Preface
!The priest begins the preface, a call to render thanks to God the Father, through Jesus Christ, in union with all the heavenly spirits. The prayer of thanksgiving and praise varies with inportant Feasts. There are at the present time 15 different prefaces which are given in the Ordinary of the Mass. The priest begins the Preface, holding his hands over the altar:
P. The Lord be with you. 	
S. And with thy spirit. 	
P. Lift up your hearts. 	
S. We have lifted them up to the Lord. 	
P. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.

(Extending his hands, he proceeds)~

![:Priest recites silently:]
v. May the performance of my homage be pleasing to Thee, O holy Trinity: and grant that the Sacrifice which I, though unworthy, have offered up in the sight of Thy Majesty, may be acceptable to Thee, and through Thy mercy, be a propitiation for me, and for all those for whom I have offered it. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.
