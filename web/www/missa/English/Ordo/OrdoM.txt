Through our Lord Jesus Christ Thy Son, Who liveth and reigneth with Thee in the unity of the same Holy Spirit, God: through all the ages of ages.  Amen.

By Whom all things were made which are in heaven and which are on earth.  Who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from heaven.  And became incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the Virgin Mary, and was made man.  He suffered under Pontius Pilate.  Was buried; the third day he arose.  He ascended into heaven: sitteth at the right hand of God the Father almighty.  Whence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.  Of Whose kingdom there shall be no end.  And in the Holy Spirit the Lord and Giver of life, both proceeding from the Father and the Son.  With the Father and the Son to be worshipped and conglorified.  Who spake by the Prophets: and one Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church.  I confess one Baptism for the remission of sins.  I wait for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the Age to come.

v. HAIL for ever, most holy Flesh of Christ: unto eternity the highest sweetness.
![Here he makes the sign of the Cross with the Host and receives the particle which he holds in his hand.  Then he veils the chalice, and goes to the paten: and he consumes all the particles in order.  And then he takes the paten and holds it over the chalice, and cleans it thoroughly with his thumb, and then says:]
v. HAIL for ever, heavenly Drink: to me before all things and above all things, Thou art sweet.
v. MAY the Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ keep my body and soul unto eternal life.  Amen.

![The Priest goes to the right horn of the Altar and says:]
v. MAY the Body of our Lord Jesus Christ which we have taken, and His holy Blood which we have drunk, cling to our bowels, O eternal, almighty God: that it may not come unto our judgment, nor our condemnation, but be profitable to us for salvation, and for the healing of our souls unto life eternal.  Amen. 
v. BY Thy mercy, O our God, Who art blessed, and livest, and rulest all things unto ages of ages. 
R. Amen.

V. The Lord be always with you.
R. And with thy spirit.
P.  THE solemnities are accomplished in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ: may our vow be accepted with peace.

Ant. HAIL, Queen of mercy, our life, our sweetness, and our hope, hail!  To thee do we cry, banished children of Eve.  To thee do we breathe forth mourning and weeping in this valley of tears.  Turn then, O our advocate, those thine eyes of mercy towards us.  And after this exile, show unto us the blessed Fruit of thy womb, Jesus.  O clement: O loving: O sweet Ever-Virgin Mary.
V. After childbirth thou didst remain a Virgin.
R. Mother of God, intercede for us.
