[Oratio]
 O God, from whom Judas received the punishment of his guilt, and the thief the reward of his confession: grant unto us the full fruit of Thy clemency; that even as in His Passion, our Lord Jesus Christ gave to each a retribution according to his merits, so having taken away our old sins, He may bestow upon us the grace of His Resurrection. Who with Thee liveth and reigneth in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God, world without end.

Lesson from the first letter of blessed Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians
!1 Cor 11:20-32.
Brethren, When you come therefore into one place, it is not now to eat the Lord's supper. For every one taketh before his own supper to eat. And one indeed is hungry and another is drunk. What, have you not houses to eat and to drink in? Or despise ye the church of God and put them to shame that have not? What shall I say to you? Do I praise you? In this I praise you not. For I have received of the Lord that which I also delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which He was betrayed, took bread, and giving thanks, broke and said: Take ye and eat: This is My Body, which shall be delivered for you. This do for the commemoration of Me. In like manner also the chalice, after He had supped, saying: This chalice is the new testament in My Blood. This do ye, as often as you shall drink, for the commemoration of Me. For as often as you shall eat this bread and drink the chalice, you shall show the death of the Lord, until He come. Therefore, whosoever shall eat this bread, or drink the chalice of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the Body and the Blood of the Lord. But let a man prove himself; and so let him eat of that bread and drink of the chalice. For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, not discerning the Body of the Lord. Therefore are there many infirm and weak among you: and many sleep. But if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But whilst we are judged, we are chastised by the Lord, that we be not condemned with this world.  	
 
[Graduale]
!Fl 2:8-9
Christ became obedient for us unto death, even to the death of the cross. 
V. For which cause God also exalted Him and hath given Him a Name which is above all names.

[Evangelium]
Continuation ++ of the holy Gospel according to John
!Jo 13:1-15
 Before the festival-day of the Pasch, Jesus knowing that His hour was come, that He should pass out of this world to the Father, having loved His own who were in the world. He loved them unto the end. And when supper was done the devil having now put into the heart of Judas, the son of Simon the Iscariot, to betray Him, knowing that the Father had given Him all things into His hands and that He came from God and goeth to God: He riseth from supper and layeth aside His garments and, having taken a towel, girded Himself. After that, He putteth water into a basin and began to wash the feet of the disciples and to wipe them with the towel wherewith He was girded. He cometh therefore to Simon Peter. And Peter saith to Him: Lord, dost Thou wash my feet? Jesus answered and said to him: What I do, thou knowest not now: but thou shalt know hereafter. Peter saith to Him: Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him: If I wash thee not, thou shalt have no part with Me. Simon Peter saith to Him: Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head. Jesus saith to him: He that is washed needeth not but to wash his feet, but is clean wholly. And you are clean, but not all. For He knew who he was that would betray Him; therefore He said: You are not all clean. Then after He had washed their feet and taken His garments, being set down again, He said to them: Know you what I have done to you? You call Me Master and Lord. And you say well; for so I am. If then I being your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that as I have done to you, so you do also.

!!Pange Lingua
v. Sing, my tongue, the Saviour's glory:
Of His Flesh the mystery sing;
Of His Blood all price exceeding.
Shed by our immortal King.
Destined for the world's redemption
From a noble womb to spring. 
_  
v. Of a pure and spotless Virgin,
Born for us on earth below,
He, as Man with man conversing,
Stayed the seeds of truth to sow,
Then He closed in solemn order
Wondrously His life of woe. 	
_
On the night of His last supper,
Seated with His chosen band,
He, the paschal victim eating,
First fulfills the Law's command;
Then as food to all His brethren
Gives himself with His own hand. 	
_
v. Word made Flesh, the bread of nature,
By His words to Flesh He turns;
Wine into His Blood He changes:
What though sense no change discerns,
Only be the heart in earnest,
Faith her lesson quickly learns. 	
_
v. Down in adoration falling,
Lo, the Sacred Host we hail,
Lo, o'er ancient forms departing
Newer rites of grace prevail;
Faith for all defects supplying,
Where the feeble senses fail. 
_
v. To the everlasting Father
And the Son who reigns on high
With the Holy Ghost proceeding
Forth from each eternally,
Be salvation, honor, blessing,
Might and endless majesty.
Amen.

!Antiphone
!Sl 21:19
Ant. They parted my garments amongst them, and upon my vesture they cast lots.
v. My God, my God, look upon me: why hast Thou forsaken me? Far from my salvation are the words of my sins.
O my God, I shall cry by day and Thou wilt not hear: and by night, and it shall not be reputed as folly in me.
But Thou dwellest in holiness, O Thou Praise of Israel.
In Thee our fathers have hoped: they have hoped, and Thou hast delivered them.
They cried unto Thee, and were delivered: they trusted in Thee, and were not confounded.  	
But I am a worm and no man: a reproach of men, and the outcast of the people.
All they that saw me have laughed me to scorn: they have spoken with the lips, and wagged their head.
He trusted the Lord, let Him rescue him: let Him deliver him, seeing He delighteth in him. 
For Thou art He that hast drawn em out of the womb: my hope from the breasts of my mother. I was cast upon Thee from the womb.
From my mother's womb thou art my God: depart not from me.
For tribulation is very near; for there is none to help me.
Many calves have surrounded me: fat bulls have besieged me.  	
They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion.
I am poured out like water, and all my bones are scattered.
My heart is like melting wax in the midst of my bowels.
My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws: and Thou hast brought me into the dust of death.  	
For many dogs have compassed me: the council of the malignant have beseiged me.
They pierced my hands and my feet: they have told all my bones.  	
They look and stare upon me. They part my garments among them, and upon my vesture do they cast lots.
But Thou, O Lord, remove not Thy help to a distance from me: look towards my defense.
 O God, deliver my soul from the sword: my darling from the power of the dog!
 Save me from the lion's mouth: and my affliction from the horns of the unicorns.
 I will declare Thy Name unto my brethren: in the midst of the church will I praise Thee.
Ye that fear the Lord, praise Him: all ye seed of Jacob, glorify Him.
 Let all the seed of Israel fear Him. Because He hath not slighted nor despised the supplication of the poor man.  	
 Neither hath He hid His face from me: but when I cried unto Him, He heard me.
 With Thee is my praise in the great church: I will pay my vows in the sight of them that fear Him.  	
The poor shall eat and be filled, and they shall praise the Lord that seek Him: their hearts shall live for ever and ever.
All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto the Lord.  	
And all the kindreds of the Gentiles shall adore in His sight.  	
For the kingdom is the Lord's: and He shall have dominion over the nations.
 All the fat ones of the earth have eaten and have adored: all they that go down to the earth shall fall before Him.
 My soul also shall live unto Him: and my seed shall serve Him.
 The generation to come shall tell it unto the Lord: and the heavens shall declare His righteousness unto a people that shall be born, whom the Lord hath made.
Ant. They parted my garments amongst them, and upon my vesture they cast lots.
My God, my God, look upon me: why hast Thou forsaken me? Far from my salvation are the words of my sins.

!!Washing of the feet
!  At a convenient hour, after the unclothing of the altars, a signal is given with the clapper, and the clergy assemble for the Maundy or the Washing of the feet. The prelate or superior wears a purple stole and cope over his amice and alb, and with the deacon and subdeacon vested in white dalmatics, comes to the appointed place. The celebrant puts incense into the thurible, served by the deacon. Then the deacon, holding the Gospel book before his breast, kneels before the celebrant and asks a blessing; having received it, while two acolytes stand by with lighted candles, and the subdeacon holds the book, he makes the Sign of the Cross over teh book and incenses it and sings, in the usual way, the Gospel of the Mass: Before the festival-day, as above. After this the subdeacon takes the Gospel book open to the officiating priest to kiss, and the deacon incenses him as usual. Then the celebrant removes his cope, girds himself with a cloth, and assisted by his ministers, begins the washing of the feet of twelve clerks or twelve poor people chosen for the ceremony. While the subdeacon holds the right foot of each of those whose feet are to be washed, the celebrant, kneeling before him, washes the foot, wipes and kisses it, the deacon handing him a towel for the wiping. Meanwhile the following chants are sung by the choir.
