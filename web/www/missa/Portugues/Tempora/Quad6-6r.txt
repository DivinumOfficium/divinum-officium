[Prelude]
!! The Blessing of the New Fire

! At the appointed hour, the altar is prepared, but candles are not lit until the beginning of Mass. Meanwhile, fire is struck from a flint, and coals are enkindled from it. The celebrant vests in amice, alb, cincture, stole, and violet cope (the chasuble is not substituted); the sacred ministers vest in amice, alb, and cincture. The deacon vests in stole and dalmatic, the subdeacon vests in tunic of the same color. The ministers (and servers) with processional cross, holy water, and incense proceed to the doors, whether outside or in the entry to the church, whichever allows the greatest number of people to follow the Sacred Rites. The celebrant then blesses the new fire, saying in Ferial Tone B (or in the ancient simple tone) with hands joined:
V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with thy spirit.
v. Let us pray.
O God, Who hast bestowed on the faithful the fire of Thy brightness by Thy Son, Who is the Cornerstone, hallow this new fire produced from a flint that it may be profitable to us: and grant that during this Paschal festival we may be so inflamed with heavenly desires, that with pure minds we may come to the solemnity of perpetual light. Through the same Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
! Then he sprinkles the fire thrice, in silence. An acolyte (or one of the ministers) takes a blessed coal and places it in the thurible; the celebrant then puts incense in the thurible, blessing it as usual, then he incenses the fire thrice.
_
_
!! The Blessing of the Paschal Candle
! An acolyte (or one of the ministers) carries the paschal candle to the blessed new fire and stands in front of the celebrant, who inscribes a cross between the openings into which grains of incense will be placed. Above the cross, he inscribes the Greek letter Alpha, and under the cross, he inscribes the Greek letter Omega. Between the arms of the cross, he inscribes the four numbers of the current year, while saying in an audible voice:
r. Christ yesterday and today
r. The Beginning and End
r. Alpha
r. and Omega.
r. His are the times
r. and the ages.
r. To Him be glory and empire
r. through all eternal ages.
_
! With the incision of the cross and other symbols done, the deacon (or another minister) presents five grains of incense to the celebrant. If the grains have not been previously blessed, the celebrant sprinkles them thrice with holy water, and incenses them thrice, in silence. Then he inserts the five grains into their openings, while saying audibly:
r. Through His holy
r. and glorious wounds
r. may Christ the Lord
r. preserve
r. and keep us. Amen.
! Then the deacon (or another minister) offers the celebrant a taper, lit from the new fire. The celebrant lights the Paschal candle and says audibly:
v. May the light of Christ, gloriously risen
Dispel the darkness of the heart and mind.
_
! The celebrant quickly lights the Paschal candle and sings in Ferial Tone B (or the simple ancient tone) with hands joined:
V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with thy spirit.
v. Let us pray.
May the abundant outpouring of Thy + blessing, we beseech Thee, almighty God, descend upon this incense: and do Thou, O invisible Regenerator, lighten this nocturnal brightness, that not only the sacrifice that is offered this night may shine by the secret mixture of Thy light: but also into whatever place anything of this mysterious sanctification shall be brought, there the power of Thy Majesty may be present and all the malicious artifices of Satan may be defeated. Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
_
! Meanwhile, all the lights in the church are put out. The clerics and people are given candles, which will be carried in procession and lit from the Paschal candle.
_
_
!! The Procession with the Paschal Candle
! The celebrant again puts incense into the thurible; after which the deacon, having laid aside his violet vestments, puts on a white stole and dalmatic, takes the Paschal candle. The procession is made in the following order: thurifer, subdeacon with cross, deacon with lit Paschal candle, celebrant, clerics according to their rank and precedence, then the people.  If there is no deacon, the following simple rite may be used: the priest, having laid aside his violet vestments, puts on a white stole and dalmatic. He again puts incense into the thurible and takes the Paschal candle. The procession is made in the following order: thurifer, crucifer, priest with lit Paschal candle, the other servers, then the people. When the deacon or celebrant comes to the threshold of the Church, he stands and sings alone:
V. The light of Christ.
! at which everyone else, except the subdeacon or crucifer and thurifer,
genuflects toward the Paschal candle, singing in response:
R. Thanks be to God.
! All rise, and the celebrant or a server representing him lights his candle from the Paschal candle. The procession proceeds to the middle of the church, where the deacon or celebrant sings in the same mode on a higher pitch:
V. The light of Christ.
! at which everyone, as before, genuflects and responds:
R. Thanks be to God.
! The the other clerics or servers light their candles from the Paschal candle. The procession continues to the front of the altar, in the middle of the sanctuary, and again the verse is sung on a higher pitch:
V. The light of Christ.
! and a third time, everyone, as before, genuflects and responds:
R. Thanks be to God.
! The people's candles are lit from the Paschal candle, which light up the church.
_
_
!! The Singing of the Paschal Proclamation
! After a reverence has been made toward the altar, the thurifer stands near the credence; and the subdeacon with the processional cross stands on the Gospel side in front of the lectern, facing it for the singing of the Paschal proclamation. The celebrant goes to his place in the sanctuary, on the epistle side; and the clerics take their places on benches or stools. The deacon places the Paschal candle in a small supporting base in the middle of the choir, and, after the celebrant has placed incense in the thurible, receives the book and asks for the blessing, as usual.

Sir, give me Thy blessing.
C. May the Lord be on thy heart and on thy lips, that thou mayest worthily and fittingly proclaim His Paschal praise.
R. Amen.

!If there is no deacon, the following simple rite may be used: the thurifer stands next to the credence in the sanctuary, the crucifer stands on the Gospel side in front of the lectern, facing it. The celebrant places the Paschal candle in its supporting base in the middle of the sanctuary and goes to the sedilia; the other servers go to their usual places. After placing incense into the thurible, the celebrant receives the book from the master of ceremonies. The celebrant genuflects on the bottom step of the footpace, on the epistle side, and says in a low voice: O Lord, give me Thy blessing. May the Lord be on my heart and on my lips, that I mayest worthily and fittingly proclaim His Paschal praise.
_
! After this, the deacon or celebrant goes to the lectern, which is completely covered with a white drape. He places the book on the lecturn and incenses it; then he circles the Paschal candle, incensing it. Then all rise and remain standing, as they usually do when the Gospel is proclaimed at Mass, while the deacon sings or the celebrant sings or reads the Paschal proclamation, having before him the Paschal candle and the processional cross, toward the left (liturgical north) side of the church. All hold lit candles in their hands until the end of the Paschal proclamation.
v. Let the angelic choirs of Heaven now rejoice; let the divine Mysteries rejoice; and let the trumpet of salvation sound forth the victory of so great a King. Let the earth also rejoice, made radiant by such splendor; and, enlightened with the brightness of the eternal King, let it know that the darkness of the whole world is scattered. Let our mother the Church also rejoice, adorned with the brightness of so great a light; and let this temple resound with the loud acclamations of the people.  Wherefore I beseech you, most beloved brethren, who are here present in the wondrous brightness of this holy light, to invoke wtih me the mercy of almighty God. That He who has vouchsafed to admit me among the Levites, without any merits of mine, would pour forth the brightness of His light upon me, and enable me to perfect the praise of this wax candle.  Through our Lord Jesus Christ His Son, Who with Him and the Holy Ghost liveth and reigneth one God for ever and ever. R. Amen.
V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with thy spirit.
V. Lift up thy hearts.
R. We have them lifted up to the Lord.
V. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God..
R. It is meet and just.
v. It is truly meet and right to proclaim with all our heart and all the affection of our mind, and with the ministry of our voices, the invisible God, the Father almighty, and His only-begotten Son our Lord Jesus Christ, who repaid for us to His eternal Father the debt of Adam, and by the merciful shedding of His Blood, cancelled the debt incurred by original sin. For this is the Paschal Festival; in which that true Lamb is slain, with Whose Blood the doorposts of the faithful are consecrated. This is the night in which Thou didst formerly cause our forefathers, the children of Israel, when brought out of Egypt, to pass through the Red Sea with dry foot. This, therefore, is the night which dissipated the darkness of sinners by the light of the pillar.  This is the night which at this time throughout the world restores to grace and unites in sanctity those that believe in Christ, and are separated from the vices of the world and the darkness of sinners.  This is the night in which, destroying the chains of death, Christ arose victorious from the grave. For it would have profited us nothing to have been born, unless redemption had also been bestowed upon us. O wondrous condescension of Thy mercy towards us! O inestimable affection of love: that Thou mightest redeem a slave, Thou didst deliver up Thy Son! O truly needful sin of Adam, which was blotted out by the death of Christ! O happy fault, that merited to possess such and so great a Redeemer! O truly blessed night, which alone deserved to know the time and hour when Christ rose again from hell! This is the night of which it is written: And the night shall be as clear as the day; and the night is my light in my delights.  Therefore the hallowing of this night puts to flight all wickedness, cleanses sins, and restores innocence to the fallen, and gladness to the sorrowful. It drives forth hatreds, it prepares concord, and brings down haughtiness.

Wherefore, in this sacred night, receive, O holy Father, the evening sacrifice of this incense, which holy Church renders to Thee by the hands of Thy ministers in the solemn offering of this wax candle, made out the work of bees.  Now also we know the praises of this pillar, which the shining fire enkindles to the honor of God. Which fire, although divided into parts, suffers no loss from its light being borrowed. For it is nourished by the melting wax, which the mother bee produced for the substance of this precious light.  O truly blessed night, which plundered the Egyptians and enriched the Hebrews! A night in which heavenly things are united to those of earth, and things divine to those which are of man.

We beseech Thee, therefore, O Lord, that this wax candle hallowed in honor of Thy Name, may continue to burn to dissipate the darkness of this night. And being accepted as a sweet savor, may be united with the heavenly lights. Let the morning star find its flame alight. That star, I mean, which knows no setting. He Who returning from hell, serenely shone forth upon mankind.  We beseech Thee therefore, O Lord, that Thou wouldst grant peaceful times during this Paschal Festival, and vouchsafe to rule, govern, and keep with Thy constant protection us Thy servants, and all the clergy, and the devout people, together with our most holy Father, Pope N., and our Bishop N.. Have regard, also, for those who reign over us, and, grant them Thine ineffable kindness and mercy, direct their thoughts in justice and peace, that from their earthy toil, they may come to their heavenly reward with all Thy people.  Through the same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, who with Thee liveth and reigneth in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God: World without end. R. Amen.
! After the Paschal proclamation is completed, all extinguish their candles and are seated.

!!The Readings
! The deacon, at the sedilia or some other appropriate place, lays aside his white vestments and again vests in violet. The subdeacon, giving the processional cross to the master of ceremonies, returns to his place. An acolyte removes the white drape from the lecturn, or places another undecorated lecturn in front of it.  The lectors in choir dress make a reverence toward the altar, then go to the lecturn and read the readings, facing the Paschal candle, which is to the right hand (the Gospel side) of the altar, toward the left side (liturgical north) of the church. The readings are read without title, and the response Deo gratias is not made. All are seated and listen. If there is no deacon, the following simple rite may be used: the celebrant returns to the sedilia. With the assistance of the servers, he removes the white dalmatic and stole, and again puts on the violet stole and chasuble. The crucifer places the processional cross near the credence table on the epistle side. The servers remove the white drape from the lecturn, or place another undecorated lecturn in an opportune place in front of it. Wearing the violet chasuble, the celebrant returns to the lecturn for the recitation of the readings. -- If a suitable lector is present, he may recite the readings, wearing the cotta. In this case, the celebrant is seated and listens. The readings are read without title, and the response Deo gratias is not made. They are read from the middle of the sanctuary, by either the celebrant or a lector, facing the Paschal candle, which is to the right hand (the Gospel side) of the altar, toward the left side (liturgical north) of the church. The servers and people are seated and listen.
!THE FIRST READING 
!Gen. 1:1-31; 2:1-2
In the beginning, God created heaven and earth. And the earth was void and empty, and darkness was upon the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God moved over the water. And God said: Be light made. And light was made. And God saw the light that it was good: and He divided the light from the darkness. And He called the light Day, and the darkness Night: and there was evening and morning, one day. And God said: Let there be a firmament made amidst the waters: and let it divide the waters from the waters. And God made a firmament, and divided the waters that were under the firmament from those that were above the firmament. And it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven: and the evening and morning were the second day. God also said: Let the waters that are under the heaven be gathered together into one place; and let the dry land appear. And it was so done. And God called the dry land Earth: and the gathering together of the waters He called Seas. And God saw that it was good. And He said: Let the earth bring forth his green herb, after its kind, which may have seed in itself upon the earth. And it was so done. And the earth brought forth the green herb, and such as tieldeth seed according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. And the evening and morning were the third day. And God said: Let there be lights made in the firmament of heaven to divide the day and the night, and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years.: to shine in the firmament of heaven. and to give light to the earth. And it was so done. And God made two great lights: a greater light to rule the day; and a lesser light to rule the night: and the stars. And He set them in the firmament of heaven, to shine upon the earth, and to rule the day and the night, and to divide the earth, and to rule the day and the night, and to divide the light and the darkness. And God saw that it was good. And the evening and morning were the fourth day. God also said: Let het waters bring forth the creeping creature having life, and the fowl that may fly over the earth under the firmament of heaven. And God created the great whales, and every living thing and moving creature which the waters brought forth, according to their kinds, and every winged fowl according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. And He blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply, and fill the waters of the sea: and let the birds be multiplied upon the earth. And the evening and the morning were the fifth day. And God said: Let the earth bring forth the living creature in its kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth according to their kinds. And it was so done. And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds, and cattle, and every thing and every thing that creepeth on the earth after its kind. And God saw that it was good. And He said: Let us make man to His own image and likeness: and let him have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and the beasts, and the whole earth, and every creeping creature that moveth upon the earth. And God created man to His own image: to the image of God He created him, male and female He created them. And God blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it, and rule over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and all living creatures that move upon the earth. And God said: Behold, I have given you every herb-bearing seed upon the earth, and all trees that have in themselves seed of their own kind to be your meat: and to all the beasts of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to all that move upon the earth, and wherein there is life, that they may have to feed upon. And it was so done. And God saw all the things that He had made, and they were very good. And the evening and morning were the sixth day. So the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the furniture of them. And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had made: and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done.
_`
! All stand for the prayer. The people genuflect along with the celebrant, who then sings the following prayer with hands joined in ferial tone A (or the ancient solemn tone), while an acolyte holds the book before him.
v. Let us pray. 
V. Let us kneel. 
R. Arise.
O God, who hast wonderfully created man, and more wonderfully restored him: grant us, we beseech Thee, to stand firm with strong minds against the allurements of sin, that we may deserve to arrive at everlasting joys.

!THE SECOND READING 
!Exo. 14:24-31; 15:1
In those days, it came to pass in the morning watch, and behold the Lord looking upon the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire, and of the cloud, slew their host: and overthrew the wheels of the chariots, and they were carried into the deep. And the Egyptians said: Let us flee from Israel: for the Lord fighteth for them against us. And the Lord said to Moses: Stretch forth thy hand over the sea, that the waters may com again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots and horsemen. And when Moses had stretched forth his hand towards the sea, it returned at the first break of day to the former place: and as the Egyptians were fleeing away the waters came upon them, and the Lord shut them up in the middle of the waves. And the waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen of all the army of Pharao, who had come into the sea after them: neither did there so much as one of them remain. But the children of Israel marched through the midst of the sea upon dry land, and the waters were to them as a wall on the right hand and the left: and the Lord delivered Israel on that day out of the hand of the Egyptians. And they saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore, and the mighty hand of the Lord had used against them: and the people feared the Lord, and they believed the Lord, and Moses His servant. Then Moses and the children of Israel sung this canticle to the Lord, and said:
_`

!Exod 15:1-2
Let us sing to the Lord, for He is gloriously honored: the horse and the rider He hath thrown into the sea: He has become my Helper and Protector unto salvation.

V. He is the Lord that destroys wars: the Lord is His Name.
_`
v. Let us pray. 
V. Let us kneel. 
R. Arise.
O God, Whose ancient miracles we see shining also in our days, whilst by the water of regeneration Thou dost operate for the salvation of the Gentiles, that which by the power of Thy right hand Thou didst confer upon one people, by delivering them from the Egyptian persecution: grant that all the nations of the world may become the children of Abraham, and partake of the dignity of the people of Israel.

!Is 4:2-6
In that day the bud of the Lord shall be in magnificence and glory, and the fruit of the earth shall be high, and a great joy to them that shall have escaped of Israel. And it shall come to pass, that every one that shall be left in Sion, and that shall remain in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, every one that is written in life in Jerusalem. If the Lord shall wash away the filth of the daughters of Sion, and shall wash away the blood of Jerusalem out of the midst thereof, by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning. And the Lord will create upon every place of mount Sion, and where he is called upon, a cloud by day, and a smoke and the brightness of a flaming fire in the night: for over all the glory shall be a protection. And there shall be a tabernacle for a shade in the daytime from the heat, and for a security and covert from the whirlwind, and from rain.

!THE FOURTH READING 
!Deut. 31:22-30
In those days: Moses therefore wrote the canticle, and taught it to the children of Israel. And the Lord commanded Josue the son of Nun, and said: Take courage, and be valiant: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I have promised, and I will be with thee. Therefore after Moses had wrote the words of this law in a volume, and finished it: he commanded the Levites, who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, saying: Take this book, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God: that it may be there for a testimony against thee. For I know thy obstinacy, and thy most stiff neck. While I am yet living, and going in with you, you have always been rebellious against the Lord: how much more when I shall be dead? Gather unto me all the ancients of your tribes, and your doctors, and I will speak these words in their hearing, and will call heaven and earth to witness against them. For I know that, after my death, you will do wickedly, and will quickly turn aside form the way that I have commanded you: and evils shall come upon you in the latter times, when you shall do evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him by the works of your hands. Moses therefore spoke, in the hearing of the whole assembly of Israel, the words of this canticle, and finished it even to the end:
_`
!CANTICLE 
!Deut 32:1-4
Hear, O ye heavens, the things I speak, let the earth give ear to the words of my mouth. 
V. Let my doctrine gather as the rain, let my speech distill as the dew, as a shower upon the herb. 
V. And as drops upon the grass: because I will invoke the name of the Lord. 
V. Give ye magnificence to our God: The works of God are perfect, and all his ways are judgments. 
V. God is faithful and without any iniquity, he is just and right.

v. Let us pray.
V. Let us kneel.
R. Arise.
O God, the exaltation of the humble, and the strength of the righteous, Who, by Thy holy servant Moses, wast pleased so to instruct Thy people by the singing of Thy sacred canticle, that the renewal of the law should be also our guidance: show forth Thy power to all the multitude of Gentiles justified by Thee, and by mitigating Thy terror grant them joy: that, all sins being blotted out by Thy remission, the threatened vengeance may give way to salvation.

!! The Blessing of the Baptismal Water
! After the invocation 'Omnes Sancti et Sanctae Dei' is made, all rise. The cantors, if the litany has been sung, return to their places. After a reverence has been made toward the altar, the celebrant and ministers come to the place where the baptismal water will be blessed.  The sacred ministers and servers should be placed -- in whatever way may be fitting -- around the vessel containing the water in this manner:  a) The celebrant stands in the sight of the people, having before him the vessel of water. The Paschal Candle is on his right, and a subdeacon or another cleric (or a server) with a cross on his left. b) The sacred ministers (or the servers) stand on both sides near the celebrant, that they may assist in whatever way needed for the ceremony. c) An acolyte (or a server) stands facing the celebrant with a Missal, unless a lecturn may be brought up. Then, in ferial tone A (or the ancient simple tone) the celebrant says with joined hands:
V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with thy spirit.
v. Let us pray 
Almighty and everlasting God, be present at these Mysteries of Thy great kindness, be present at these Sacraments: and send forth Thy Spirit of adoption to regenerate the new people, whom the font of baptism brings forth; that what is to be done by our humble ministry may be accomplished by the effect of Thy power. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who liveth and reigneth in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God:
! Raising his voice to the tone of the preface, and joining his hands, he continues:
v. World without end.
R. Amen.
V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with thy spirit.
V. Lift up thy hearts.
R. We have them lifted up to the Lord.
V. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God..
R. It is meet and just.
v. It is meet and just, right and availing unto salvation, to give Thee thanks always and in all places, O holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God, Who, by Thine ineffable power dost wonderfully produce the effect of Thy Sacraments: and though we are unworthy to perform such great mysteries: yet, as Thou dost not abandon the gifts of Thy grace, so Thou inclinest the ears of Thy goodness, even to our prayers. O God, Whose Spirit in the very beginning of the world moved over the waters, that even then the nature of water might receive the virtue of sanctification. O God, Who by water didst wash away the crimes of the guilty world, and by the pouring out of the deluge didst give a figure of regeneration, that one and the same element might in a mystery be the end of vice and the beginning of virtue. Look, O Lord, on the face of Thy Church, and multiply in her Thy regenerations, who by the streams of Thine abundant grace fillest Thy city with joy, and openest the font of Baptism all over the world for the renewal of the Gentiles: that by the command of Thy Majesty she may receive the grace of Thine only Son from the Holy Ghost.
! Here the celebrant, with outstretched hand, divides the water in the form of a cross, and wiping his hand with a towel, says:
v. May He by a secret mixture of His divine virtue render this water fruitful for the regeneration of men, to the end that a heavenly offspring, conceived by sanctification, may emerge from the immaculate womb of this divine font, reborn a new creature: and may all, however distinguished either by sex in body, or by age in time, be brought forth to the same infancy by grace, their mother. Therefore may all unclean spirits, by Thy command, O Lord, depart far from hence: may the whole malice of diabolical deceit be entirely banished: may no power of the enemy prevail here: let him not fly about to lay his snares; may he not creep in by stealth: may he not corrupt with his poison.
v. May this holy and innocent creature be free from all the assaults of the enemy, and purified by the destruction of all his wickedness. May it be a living fountain, a regenerating water, a purifying stream: that all those that are to be washed in this saving bath may obtain, by the operation of the Holy Ghost, the grace of a perfect cleansing.
! He makes the Sign of the Cross over the water three times, and continues:
v. Therefore, I bless thee, O creature of water, by the living + God, by the true + God, by the holy + God: by that God Who, in the beginning, separated thee by His Word from the dry land, Whose Spirit moved over thee.
! Here he divides the water and casts some toward the four corners of the earth, saying:
v. Who made thee flow from the fountain of paradise and commanded thee to water the whole earth with thy four rivers. Who, changing thy bitterness in the desert into sweetness made thee fit to drink, and produced thee out of a rock to quench the thirsty people. I bless + thee also by our Lord Jesus Christ, His only Son: Who in Cana of Galilee changed thee into wine by a wonderful miracle of His power. Who walked upon thee with dry foot, and was baptized in thee by John in the Jordan. Who made thee flow out of His side together with His Blood, and commanded His disciples that such as believed should be baptised in thee, saying: Go, teach all nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
! He changes his voice and proceeds in the tone of the Lesson.
v.Do thou, almighty God, mercifully assist us who observe this commandment: do Thou graciously inspire us.
! He breathes on the water three times in the shape of the Cross.
v. Do Thou with Thy mouth bless these clear waters: that besides their natural virtue of cleansing the body, they may also prove efficacious for the purifying of the soul.
! He lowers the Paschal candle into the water, and sings in the tone of the Preface:
v. May the virtue of the Holy Ghost descend into all the water of this font.
! Withdrawing the candle from the water, he lowers it again to a greater depth and repeats in a higher tone 
v. May the virtue of the Holy Ghost descend into all the water of this font.
 Withdrawing it yet again, he again lowers it to the bottom of the vessel, repeating in yet a higher tone 
v. May the virtue of the Holy Ghost descend into all the water of this font.
! Then breathing upon the water three times in the form of the Greek letter &Psi;, he repeats the following verse three times:
v. And make the whole substance of this water fruitful for regeneration.
v. And make the whole substance of this water fruitful for regeneration.
v. And make the whole substance of this water fruitful for regeneration.
! Here the Paschal candle is taken out of the water, and he continues:
v. Here may the stains of all sins be washed out; here may human nature, created in v. Here may the stains of all sins be washed out; here may human nature, created in v. Here may the stains of all sins be washed out; here may human nature, created in Thine image, and reformed to the honor of its Author, be cleansed from all the filth of the old man: that all who receive the Sacrament of regeneration, may be born again new children of true innocence. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son: Who shall come to judge the living and the dead, and the world by fire. R. Amen.
_
_
! Then one of the clerics or a server withdraws some of the blessed water into a vessel, which will be used for the sprinkling of the faithful after the renewal of baptismal vows, and for the sprinkling of homes and other places. This done, the celebrant who blessed the water pours the Oil of Catechumens into the water in the shape of the Cross, saying in an audible voice:
v. May this font be sanctified and made fruitful by the Oil of salvation, for those who are born anew therein unto life everlasting. 
R. Amen.
! Then he pours Holy Chrism into the water in the shape of the Cross, saying:
v. May the infusion of the Chrism of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Ghost the Comforter, be made in the Name of the Holy Trinity. R. Amen.
! Then he takes both the vials of the Oil of Catechemens and the Holy Chrism, and pours them both into the water three times in the shape of the Cross, saying:
v. May this mixture of the Chrism of sanctification, and of the Oil of unction, and of the water of Baptism, be made to the Name of the + Father, + and of the Son, and of the Holy + Ghost. 
R. Amen.
_
! He then mixes the Oil and Chrism with the water. If there are any to be baptized, the Sacrament of Baptism here follows in the usual manner, according to Title II of the Rituale Romanum. If there are many to be baptized, certain alterations may be made so that the Baptismal rite is performed collectively rather than individually. If a bishop with jurisdiction is present, the neophytes may then receive the Sacrament of Confirmation. The blessing having been given, and the neophytes (if any) having been baptized, the baptismal water is now carried in solemn procession to the baptistry. The celebrant puts incense into the thurible, and the procession is formed in the following order:  a.) the thurifer precedes with the thurible  b.) the subdeacon of the Cross or crucifer with processional cross  c.) the clergy or servers  d.) the subdeacon and deacon or servers carrying the baptismal water  e.) finally, the celebrant, with covered head The Paschal candle remains in its place. During the procession, the following hymn is sung:
!Sl 41:2-4
v. As the hart panteth after the fountains of water, so my soul panteth after Thee, O God. 
V. My soul hath thirsted for the living God: when shall I come and appear before the face of God? 
V. My tears have become my bread day and night, while they say to me daily: Where is thy God?
_
! The baptismal water is poured into the font, and the celebrant with hands joined sings in ferial tone A (or the ancient simple tone):
V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with thy spirit.
v. Let us pray.
O Almighty and everlasting God, look mercifully on the devotion of Thy people about to be reborn, who like the hart pant after the fountain of Thy waters: and mercifully grant that the thirst of their faith may, by the Sacrament of Baptism, hallow their souls and bodies. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, who with Thee liveth and reigneth in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God, world without end. 
R. Amen.
_
! If the baptistry is separate from the body of the Church, it may be preferable to bless the baptismal water in the font in the Baptistry. If this is the case, the clergy and servers form a procession when the cantors sing 'Sancta Trinitas, unus Deus', miserere nobis in the Litanies. The cantors remain in the sanctuary singing the Litany, if necessary repeating it from the line 'Sancta Maria, ora pro nobis', and the psalm 'Sicut cervus desiderat follows'. Upon arrival at the entrance to the baptistry, the celebrant says the prayer 'Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, respice propitius', the font is filled, and the blessing occurs as described above. Afterwards, the clergy and servers return to the church in silence.
_
_
!! The Renewal of Baptismal Promises
! The blessing of baptismal water being done, it is poured into the font, and the renewal of baptismal promises commences. If there is no blessing of baptismal water, the renewal of baptismal promises is done following the first part of the litany. It is fitting that everyone hold lit candles in their hands, except the celebrant and the sacred ministers or servers. The celebrant, at the sedile, removes his violet chasuble and puts on a white stole and cope, unless these have already been put on for the baptismal ceremony. Meanwhile the acolyte or server lights all candles held by the people from the Paschal Candle. The celebrant puts incense into the thurible and proceeds to the with the sacred ministers or servers to the front of the altar. After he has made a reverence, he incenses the Pascal Candle. Then he stands in front of the candle, facing the people, or from the ambo or pulpit, proceeds with the renewal of baptismal promises.  All stand, holding lit candles.
v. On this most sacred night, dearly beloved brethren, Holy Mother Church, recalling the death and burial of Our Lord Jesus Christ, returneth His love by keeping vigil; and aboundeth with joy at celebrating His glorious Resurrection.
v. But because, as the Apostle teaches, we are baptised into His death and buried together with Christ: and as Christ rose again from the dead, so we too must walk in newness of life; knowing that our old man hath been crucified together with Christ so that we shall no longer be in servitude to sin. Let us therefore look upon ourselves therefore as dead indeed to sin but living to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
v. Therefore, dearly beloved brethren, the Lenten observance now completed, let us renew the promises of baptism by which formerly we renounced Satan and his works, and the world likewise, the enemy of God; and by which we promised to serve God faithfully in the Holy Catholic Church. Therefore:
S. Do you renounce Satan?
A. We do renounce him.
S. And all his works?
A. We do renounce them.
S. And all his pomps?
A. We do renounce them.
S. Do you believe in God the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth?
A. We do believe.
S. Do you believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was born into this world and who suffered for us?
A. We do believe.
S. Do you also believe in the Holy Ghost, the holy Catholic Church, the Communionion of Saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting?
A. We do believe.
S. And now let us pray together as one, just as our Lord Jesus Christ taught us to pray:
A. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
S. And may God almighty, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath regenerated us by water and the Holy Ghost, and who hath given us remission of sins, may He by His grace keep us in the same Christ Jesus our Lord to life everlasting.
A. Amen.
_
! Then the celebrant spinkles the people with the blessed baptismal water which he had earlier drawn. If the blessing of the baptismal water did not take place, he spinkles them with regular holy water. The above exhortation and renewal of baptismal promises may be done, in all places, in the vernacular language; however, the translation must be approved by the Ordinary. The people extinguish their candles and put them down, then kneel for the second part of the litany.
_
_
!!IX. Second Part of the Litany
! After the renewal of baptismal promises, if there are cantors or clerics present to sing the litany, the celebrant and sacred ministers or servers reverence the altar, then retire to the sacristy. If there are no cantors, the celebrant himself kneels before the altar on the lowest step, on the epistle side, and sings or recites the litany, beginning with the verse Propitius esto unto the end. The people make the responses. After the litany is completed, the celebrant and servers retire to the sacristy. In the sacristy, the celebrant puts on a white chasuble for the celebration of solemn Mass. Meanwhile, the servers return the Paschal candle into its holder on the Gospel side. They prepare the altar by removing the violet cover, lighting candles, and placing relics and flowers thereupon.
V. Be merciful. R. Spare us, O Lord.
V. Be merciful. R. Graciously hear us, O Lord.
_
V. From all evil. R. Deliver us, O Lord.
V. From all sin. R. Deliver us, O Lord.
V. From everlasting death. R. Deliver us, O Lord.
V. Through the mystery of Thy holy incarnation. R. Deliver us, O Lord.

V. Through Thy Nativity. R. Deliver us, O Lord.
V. Through Thy Baptism and holy fasting. R. Deliver us, O Lord.
V. Through Thy Cross and Passion. R. Deliver us, O Lord.
V. Through Thy Death and Burial. R. Deliver us, O Lord.
V. Through Thy holy Resurrection. R. Deliver us, O Lord.
V. Through Thy wonderful Ascension. R. Deliver us, O Lord.
V. Through the coming of the Holy Ghost, the Paraclete. R. Deliver us, O Lord.
V. In the day of judgement. R. Deliver us, O Lord.
_
V. We sinners. R. Beseech Thee to hear us.
V. That Thou wouldst spare us. R. We beseech Thee to hear us.
V. That Thou wouldst vouchsafe to govern and preserve Thy holy Church. R. We beseech Thee to hear us.
V. That Thou wouldst vouchsafe to preserve our Apostolic Prelate, and all orders of the Church in holy religion. R. We beseech Thee to hear us.
V. That Thou wouldst vouchsafe to hunble the enemies of holy Church. R. We beseech Thee to hear us.
V. That Thou wouldst vouchsafe to give peace and true concord to Christian kings and princes. R. We beseech Thee to hear us.
V. That Thou wouldst vouchsafe to confirm and preserve us in Thy holy service. R. We beseech Thee to hear us.
V. That Thou wouldst render eternal blessings to all our benefactors. R. We beseech Thee to hear us.
V. That Thou wouldst vouchsafe to give and preserve the fruits of the earth. R. We beseech Thee to hear us.
V. That Thou wouldst vouchsafe to grant eternal rest to all the faithful departed. R. We beseech Thee to hear us.
V. That Thou wouldst vouchsafe to hear us. R. We beseech Thee to hear us.
_
V. Lamb of God, who takest away the sins of the world. R. Spare us, O Lord.
V. Lamb of God, who takest away the sins of the world. R. Graciously hear us, O Lord.
V. Lamb of God, who takest away the sins of the world. R. Have mercy on us.
V. Christ, hear us.
R. Christ, graciously hear us.
_
_
!!Holy Mass

! At the end of the litany, the cantors solemnly intone the 'Kyrie, eleison' as the celebrant and the sacred ministers or servers come to the altar. The celebrant reverences the altar and, omitting the psalm 'Judica me, Deus' and the public confession, ascends the altar. Omitting the usual prayer, he kisses the center of the altar, then he blesses and imposes incense and incenses the altar in the usual manner. In the simple rite, if Mass is to be sung, incense may be used in the same manner as in solemn Mass.
! The celebrant blesses incense, saying:
v. Be thou blessed + by Him in whose honour thou shalt be burned. Amen.
_
_
!!Kyrie
! Then, standing at the middle of the altar, the celebrant immediately recites the 'Kyrie eleison' in the usual manner. 
P. Lord, have mercy.
S. Lord, have mercy.
P. Lord, have mercy.
S. Christ, have mercy.
P. Christ, have mercy.
S. Christ, have mercy.
P. Lord, have mercy.
S. Lord, have mercy.
P. Lord, have mercy. 
_
_
!!Gloria
! Then he intones the 'Gloria in excelsis'. The churchbells are tolled, the organ is played, and, if deemed suitable, handbells are rung inside the church. The images and statues in the church are uncovered at this point.
v. Glory be to God on high, and on earth peace to men of good will. We praise Thee. We bless Thee. We adore Thee. We glorify Thee. We give Thee thanks for Thy great glory. O Lord God, heavenly King, God the Father almighty. O Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son. O Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father. Who takest away the sins of the world, have mercy on us. Who takest away the sins of the world, receive our prayer. Who sittest at the right hand of the Father, have mercy on us. For Thou only are holy. Thou only art the Lord. Thou only art most high, O Jesus Christ. Together with the Holy Ghost in the glory of God the Father. Amen. 
_
_
!!COLLECT
! After the singing of the Gloria is complete, the celebrant chants the Collect in the festive tone (or in the ancient solemn tone):
V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with thy spirit.
v. Let us pray 
O God, who dost illuminate this most holy night by the glory of the Lord's Resurrection, preserve in the new children of Thy family the spirit of adoption which Thou hast given; that renewed in body and mind, they may render to Thee a pure service. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, who liveth and reigneth with Thee in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God, world without end. 
R. Amen.
_
_
!!EPISTLE 
! In the simple rite, if Sung Mass is celebrated, a lector wearing a cotta may sing the epistle. The celebrant, standing at the altar, listens.
Lesson from the Epistle of Blessed Paul the Apostle to the Colossians. 
!Col 3:1-4
Brethren, if you be risen with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God: mind the things that are above, not the things that are upon the earth. For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ should appear, who is your life, then you also shall appear with Him in glory.
$Deo gratias
_
_
! After the Epistle, all rise and the celebrant intones:
V. Allleuia.
! The choir repeats:
R. Alleluia.
_`
! The celebrant and choir repeat the Alleluia twice more, each time at a higher tone.
V. Allleuia.
R. Alleluia.
_`
V. Allleuia.
R. Alleluia.
_`
! Afterward, the choir continues:
!Sl. 117, 1
V. Give praise to the Lord for He is good: for His mercy endureth forever.
!Sl 116
V. O praise the Lord, all ye nations, and praise Him all ye people.
V. For His mercy is confirmed upon us: and the truth of the Lord remaineth forever.
_
_
!!GOSPEL 
! In Solemn Masses the priest blesses the incense, and the deacon, kneeling before the altar with his hands joined, says the Munda cor.
Cleanse my heart and my lips, O almighty God, who didst cleanse the lips of the prophet Isaias with a burning coal, and vouchsafe, through Thy gracious mercy, so to purify me, that I may worthily announce Thy holy Gospel. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.
! Afterwards he takes the book from the altar, and again kneeling down before the priest, asks his blessing, saying:
D. Sir, give me thy blessing.
! The priest answers:
P. The Lord be in thy heart and on thy lips, that thou mayest worthily and in a becoming manner, proclaim His holy Gospel.
v. In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
! Then, turning back to towards the book, with his hands joined, the priest -- at Solemn Masses the deacon -- says:
P. The Lord be with you.
S. And with thy spirit.
Continuation of the holy Gospel according to St. Matthew. 
!Mt 28:1-7
And in the end of the Sabbath, when it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalen and the other Mary to see the sepulchre. And behold there was a great earthquake. For an Angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and coming, rolled back the stone and sat upon it: and his countenance was as lightening and his raiment as snow. And for fear of him the guards were struck with terror and became as dead men. And the Angel answering, said to the women: Fear not you: for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified: He is not here: for His is risen, as He said. Come and see the place where the Lord was laid. And going quickly, tell ye His disciples that He is risen: and behold He will go before you into Galilee: there you shall see Him. Lo, I have foretold it to you.
_
_
&DominusVobiscum
v. Let us pray.
! Neither Creed nor Offertory-verse is said, but the 'Gloria Patri' is said following the Lavabo. He takes the paten with the host and offering it up, says:
v. Accept, O holy Father, almighty and eternal God, this unspotted host, which I, Thy unworthy servant, offer unto Thee, my living and true God, for my innumerable sins, offenses, and negligences, and for all here present: as also for all faithful Christians, both living and dead, that it may avail both me and them for salvation unto life everlasting. Amen.
_
_
! Making the Sign of the Cross with the paten, he places the host upon the corporal. He pours wine and water into the chalice, blessing the water before it is mixed. He pours a few drops of water into the chalice containing wine, in remembrance of the water and blood which flowed from the side of Jesus when pierced by the soldier's lance.
v. O God, who, in creating human nature, didst wonderfully dignify it, and still more wonderfully restore it, grant that, by the Mystery of this water and wine, we may be made partakers of His divine nature, who vouchsafed to be made partaker of our human nature, even Jesus Christ our Lord, Thy Son, who with Thee, liveth and reigneth in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God: world without end. Amen.
_
_
! Then the priest takes the chalice, and offers it, saying:
v. We offer unto Thee, O Lord, the chalice of salvation, beseeching Thy clemency, that it may ascend before Thy divine Majesty, as a sweet savor, for our salvation, and for that of the whole world. Amen.
! The priest makes the Sign of the Cross with the chalice, places it upon the corporal, and covers it with the pall. Then, with his hands joined upon the Altar, and slightly bowing down, he says:
v. Accept us, O Lord, in the spirit of humility and contrition of heart, and grant that the sacrifice which we offer this day in Thy sight may be pleasing to Thee, O Lord God.
! Raising his eyes towards heaven, extending and then joining his hands, the priest makes the Sign of the Cross over the host and the chalice, while he invokes the Holy Spirit.
v. Come, O almighty and eternal God, the Sanctifier, and bless + this Sacrifice, prepared for the glory of Thy holy Name.
_
_
!!Incense
! At Solemn Masses, the priest now blesses incense, saying the following prayers:
v. May the Lord, by the intercession of blessed Michael the Archangel, who standeth at the right side of the altar of incense, and of all His Elect, vouchsafe to bless + this incense and receive it as an odor of sweetness: through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
! Receiving the thurible from the deacon, the priest incenses the bread and the wine, while he says:
v. May this incense, which Thou hast blessed, O Lord, ascend to Thee, and may Thy mercy descend upon us.
! Then he incenses the altar, saying:
!Sl. 140, 2-4.
v. Let my prayer, O Lord, be directed as incense in Thy sight: the lifting up of my hands as an evening sacrifice.
Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth, and a door round about my lips. May my heart not incline to evil words, to make excuses for sins.
! Giving the censor to the deacon, he says:
v. May the Lord enkindle within us the fire of His love, and the flame of everlasting charity. Amen.
! The priest is then incensed by the deacon, who then incenses the others in order.
_
_
! The priest washes his fingers to symbolize the great purity and inner cleanliness of those who offer or participate in this great Sacrifice.
!Slalm 25. 6-12
v. I will wash my hands among the innocent: and I will compass Thine altar, O Lord That I may hear the voice of praise: and tell of all Thy wonderous works. I have loved, O Lord, the beauty of Thy house and the place where Thy glory dwelleth. Take not away my soul, O God, with the wicked: nor my life with blood-thirsty men. In whose hands are iniquities, their right hand is filled with gifts. But I have walked in my innocence: redeem me, and have mercy on me. My foot hath stood in the direct way, in the churches I will bless Thee, O Lord.
&Gloria
_
_
! Bowing down before the middle of the alter, the priest, with joined hands, says:
v. Receive, O holy Trinity, this oblation which we make to Thee, in memory of the Passion, Resurrection and Ascension of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in honor of Blessed Mary, ever Virgin, blessed John the Baptist, the holy Apostles Peter and Paul, and of all the Saints, that it may avail unto their honor and our salvation, and may they vouchsafe to intercede for us in heaven, whose memory we celebrate on earth. Through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.
_
_
! The priest kisses the altar and, turning towards the people, extending, then joining his hands, says audibly:
P. Brethren, pray that my Sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the Father almighty.
! The server answers:
S. May the Lord receive the Sacrifice from thy hands, to the praise and glory of His Name, to our benefit and that of all His holy Church.
! The priest answers in a low voice:
P. Amen.
! Then, with outstretched hands, he recites the Secret Prayers, not beginning with Oremus. The Secret Prayers vary with the Mass, and are found in the Mass of the Day. These being finished, the priest says or sings: P. World without end. S. Amen. 
!SECRET
Accept, we beseech Thee, O Lord, the prayers of Thy people together with the sacrifice they offer: that what has begun by the Paschal Mysteries, may by Thine arrangement result in our eternal healing.
$Per Dominum
_

!!PREFACE
! The priest begins the preface, a call to render thanks to God the Father, through Jesus Christ, in union with all the heavenly spirits. The prayer of thanksgiving and praise varies with inportant Feasts. There are at the present time 15 different prefaces which are given in the Ordinary of the Mass. The priest begins the Preface, holding his hands over the altar:
P. The Lord be with you.
S. And with thy spirit.
P. Lift up your hearts.
S. We have lifted them up to the Lord.
P. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
S. It is meet and just. 
! Preface for Easter
v. It it truly meet and just, right and for our salvation, at all times to praise Thee, O Lord, but more gloriously especially this night when Christ our Pasch was sacrificed. For He is the Lamb Who hath taken away the sins of the world: Who by dying hath destroyed our death: and by rising again hath restored us to life. And therefore with Angels and Archangels, with Thrones and Dominations, and with all the hosts of the heavenly army, we sing the hymn of Thy glory, evermore saying:
_
v. Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Sabaoth! Heaven and earth are full of Thy glory! Hosanna in the highest! Blessed is He that cometh in the Name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!
_

Be mindful, O Lord, of Thy servants and handmaidens, N. et N. wait10 (The priest joins his hands and prays silently for those for whom he intends to pray. Then extending his hands, he proceeds:) and of all here present, whose faith and devotion are known unto Thee, for whom we offer, or who offer up to Thee, this sacrifice of praise for themselves, their families and friends, for the redemption of their souls, for the health and salvation they hope for; and who now pay their vows to Thee, the everlasting, living and true God.

_
! After pronouncing the words of the Consecration, the priest, kneeling, adores the Sacred Host; rising, he elevates It. -- Look up at the Sacred Host, with faith, piety, and love, saying: "My Lord and my God." -- and then placing It on the corporal, again adores It. After this he never disjoins his fingers and thumbs, except when he is to take the Host, until after the washing of his fingers.

v. O Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, who, according to the will of Thy Father, with the cooperation of the Holy Ghost, hast by Thy death given life to the world; deliver me by this Thy most sacred Body and Blood, from all my iniquities and from all evils; and make me always cleave to Thy commandments, and suffer me never to be separated from Thee, Who livest and reignest, with the same God the Father and the Holy Ghost, God, world without end. Amen.
_
_
v. Let not the partaking of Thy Body, O Lord, Jesus Christ, which I, though unworthy, presume to receive, turn to my judgment and condemnation; but let it, through Thy mercy, become a safeguard and remedy, both for soul and body; Who with God the Father, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, livest and reignest God, world without end. Amen.
_
_
! The priest genuflects, rises and says:
v. I will take the Bread of heaven, and will call upon the Name of the Lord.
! Slightly inclining, he takes both halves of the Host between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand, and the paten between the same forefinger and the middle one; then striking his breast with his right hand, and raising his voice a little, he says three times devoutly and humbly:
V. Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldst enter under my roof; say but the word, and my soul shall be healed.
V. Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldst enter under my roof; say but the word, and my soul shall be healed.
V. Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldst enter under my roof; say but the word, and my soul shall be healed.

! Then with his right hand, making the Sign of the Cross with the Host over the paten, he says:
v. The Body of our Lord Jesus Christ preserve my soul unto life everlasting. Amen.
! He then reverently receives both halves of the Host, joins his hands, and meditates a short time.
_
_
! Then he uncovers the Chalice, genuflects, collects whatever fragments may remain on the corporal, and purifies the paten over the Chalice, saying:
v. What return shall I make to the Lord for all He has given to me? I will take the chalice of salvation, and call upon the Name of the Lord. Praising I will call upon the Lord, and I shall be saved from my enemies.
! The priest takes the Chalice and making the Sign of the Cross with it, says:
v. The Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ preserve my soul unto life everlasting. Amen.

! Then he holds out the Chalice to the server -- in Solemn Masses to the deacon -- who pours wine into it for the first ablution, then the priest proceeds:
