#summary Describes the office descriptor data structure.
= Introduction =

Office descriptors are the data structures used internally to describe a single office (as opposed to the office of a day, which might consist of one office with a commemoration of others). The entries in [CalendarFiles calendar files] can be thought of as dehydrated forms of office descriptors, which when parsed are arranged into the structure described here, with the inclusion of all sorts of derived data.

= The structure =

Each descriptor is a hash with (some of) the following values. Often the values will be specified by symbolic constants, and typically only a few representative possibilites will be listed here. For full lists, see `Calendar/Definitions.pm`.

== `category` ==

E.g. `FESTAL_OFFICE` or `SUNDAY_OFFICE`.

== `common_ref` ==

A cache of the common for the office, as loaded by `office_string`. Intended for use by `get_office_part_from_common`. See also `office_ref`.

== `office_ref` ==

A cache of the office file, as loaded by `office_string`. Intended for use by `get_office_part`.

== `rank` ==

== `rankord` ==

An integer representing the rank in some ordered fashion. Smaller is better.

== `standing` ==

`GREATER_PRIVILEGED_DAY`, `GREATER_DAY` or `LESSER_DAY`.
