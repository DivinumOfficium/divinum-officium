#summary Proposal for module structure
#labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

To help keep the project maintainable, we should refactor a lot of the code into modules.

= Modules =

Everything should live in the `DivinumOfficium` namespace, the directory for which should live in `cgi-bin/`.

== Hierarchy ==

Incomplete!

  * `Calendar`
    * `Data`
  * `Mass`
  * `Office`
    * `LaudsAndVespers`
  * `Output`
    * `HTML`
  * `Scripting`

= Tests =

Each module should be provided with a set of unit tests. The should reside in the `t/` directory.
