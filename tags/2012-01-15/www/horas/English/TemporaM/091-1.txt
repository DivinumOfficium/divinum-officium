From the book of Job
!Job 1:13-16
13 Now upon a certain day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking~
wine in the house of their eldest brother,
14 There came a messenger to Job, and said: The oxen were ploughing, and the~
asses feeding beside them,
15 And the Sabeans rushed in, and took all away, and slew the servants with the~
sword, and I alone have escaped to tell thee.
16 And while he was yet speaking, another came, and said: The fire of God fell~
from heaven, and striking the sheep and the servants, hath consumed them, and I~
alone have escaped to tell thee.

[Responsory1]
R. My harp is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.
* Let me alone, O Lord, for my days are vanity.
V. My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.
R. Let me alone, O Lord, for my days are vanity.

!Job 1:17-19
17 And while he also was yet speaking, there came another, and said: The~
Chaldeans made three troops, and have fallen upon the camels, and taken them,~
moreover they have slain the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped~
to tell thee.
18 He was yet speaking, and behold another came in, and said: thy sons and~
daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their elder brother:
19 A violent wind came on a sudden from the side of the desert, and shook the~
four corners of the house, and it fell upon thy children and they are dead, and I~
alone have escaped to fell thee.

[Responsory2]
R. O that my sins, whereby I have deserved wrath
* And the calamity whereunder I suffer, were laid in the balances together.
V. For now it would appear heavier than the sand of the sea, therefore also my~
words are full of sorrow.
R. And the calamity, whereunder I suffer, were laid in the balances together.

!Job 1:20-22
20 Then Job rose up, and rent his garments, and having shaven his head fell~
down upon the ground and worshipped,
21 And said: Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return~
thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away: as it hath pleased the~
Lord so is it done: blessed be the name of the Lord.
22 In all these things Job sinned not by his lips, nor spoke he any foolish~
thing against God.
