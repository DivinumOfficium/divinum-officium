Lesson from the first book of Samuel
!1 Sam 18:6-8
6 Now when David returned, after be slew the Philistine, the women came out of~
all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with timbrels~
of joy, and cornets.
7 And the women sung as they played, and they said: I Saul slew his thousands,~
and David his ten thousands.
8 And Saul was exceeding angry, and this word was displeasing in his eyes, and~
he said: They have given David ten thousands, and to me they have given but a~
thousand; what can he have more but the kingdom?

!1 Sam 18:9-13
9 And Saul did not look on David with a good eye from that day and forward.
10 And the day after the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied~
in the midst of his house. And David played with his hand as at other times. And~
Saul held a spear in his hand,
11 And threw it, thinking to nail David to the wall: and David stept aside out~
of his presence twice.
12 And Saul feared David, because the Lord was with him, and was departed from~
himself.
13 Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him a captain over a thousand~
men, and he went out and came in before the people.

!1 Sam 18:14-17
14 And David behaved wisely in all his ways, and the Lord was with him.
15 And Saul saw that he was exceeding prudent, and began to beware of him.
16 But all Israel and Juda loved David, for he came in and went out before them.
17 And Saul said to David: Behold my elder daughter Merob, her will I give thee~
to wife: only be a valiant man, and fight the battles of the Lord. Now Saul said~
within himself: Let not my hand be upon him, but let the hands of the~
Philistines be upon him.
