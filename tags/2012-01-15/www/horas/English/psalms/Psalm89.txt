89:1 (A prayer of Moses the man of God.) Lord, thou hast been our refuge from generation to generation.
89:2 Before the mountains were made, or the earth and the world was formed; from eternity and to eternity thou art God.
89:3 Turn not man away to be brought low: and thou hast said: Be converted, O ye sons of men.
89:4 For a thousand years in thy sight are as yesterday, which is past. And as a watch in the night,
89:5 Things that are counted nothing, shall their years be.
89:6 In the morning man shall grow up like grass; in the morning he shall flourish and pass away: in the evening he shall fall, grow dry, and wither.
89:7 For in thy wrath we have fainted away: and are troubled in thy indignation.
89:8 Thou hast set our iniquities before thy eyes: our life in the light of thy countenance.
89:9 For all our days are spent; and in thy wrath we have fainted away. Our years shall be considered as a spider:
89:10 The days of our years in them are threescore and ten years. But if in the strong they be fourscore years: and what is more of them is labour and sorrow. For mildness is come upon us: and we shall be corrected.
89:11 Who knoweth the power of thy anger, and for thy fear
89:12 Can number thy wrath? So make thy right hand known: and men learned in heart, in wisdom.
89:13 Return, O Lord, how long? and be entreated in favour of thy servants.
89:14 We are filled in the morning with thy mercy: and we have rejoiced, and are delighted all our days.
89:15 We have rejoiced for the days in which thou hast humbled us: for the years in which we have seen evils.
89:16 Look upon thy servants and upon their works: and direct their children.
89:17 And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us: and direct thou the works of our hands over us; yea, the work of our hands do thou direct.
