(Canticle of_David * 1 Chron. 29:10-16) 
29:10 Blessed art thou, O Lord the God of Israel, our father * from eternity to eternity. 
29:11 Thine, O Lord, is magnificence, and power, * and glory, and victory: 
29:12 and to thee is praise: * for all that is in heaven, and in earth, is thine: 
29:13 Thine is the kingdom, O Lord, * and thou art above all princes. 
29:14 Thine are riches, and thine is glory, * thou hast dominion over all, 
29:15 In thy hand is power and might: * in thy hand greatness, and the empire of all things. 
29:16 Now therefore our God we give thanks to thee, * and we praise thy glorious name.
