85:1 Incline thy ear, O Lord, and hear me: * for I am needy and poor.
85:2 Preserve my soul, for I am holy: * save thy servant, O my God, that trusteth in thee.
85:3 Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I have cried to thee all the day. * Give joy to the soul of thy servant, for to thee, O Lord, I have lifted up my soul.
85:4 For thou, O Lord, art sweet and mild: * and plenteous in mercy to all that call upon thee.
85:5 Give ear, O Lord, to my prayer: * and attend to the voice of my petition.
85:6 I have called upon thee in the day of my trouble: * because thou hast heard me.
85:7 There is none among the gods like unto thee, O Lord: * and there is none according to thy works.
85:8 All the nations thou hast made shall come and adore before thee, O Lord: * and they shall glorify thy name.
85:9 For thou art great and dost wonderful things: * thou art God alone.
85:10 Conduct me, O Lord, in thy way, and I will walk in thy truth: * let my heart rejoice that it may fear thy name.
85:11 I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with my whole heart, * and I will glorify thy name for ever:
85:12 For thy mercy is great towards me: * and thou hast delivered my soul out of the lower hell.
85:13 O God, the wicked are risen up against me, and the assembly of the mighty have sought my soul: * and they have not set thee before their eyes.
85:14 And thou, O Lord, art a God of compassion, and merciful, * patient, and of much mercy, and true.
85:15 O look upon me, and have mercy on me: * give thy command to thy servant, and save the son of thy handmaid.
85:16 Shew me a token for good: that they who hate me may see, and be confounded, * because thou, O Lord, hast helped me and hast comforted me.
