48:1 Hear these things, all ye nations: * give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world.
48:2 All you that are earthborn, and you sons of men: * both rich and poor together.
48:3 My mouth shall speak wisdom: * and the meditation of my heart understanding
48:4 I will incline my ear to a parable; * I will open my proposition on the psaltery.
48:5 Why shall I fear in the evil day? * the iniquity of my heel shall encompass me.
48:6 They that trust in their own strength, * and glory in the multitude of their riches,
48:7 No brother can redeem, nor shall man redeem: * he shall not give to God his ransom,
48:8 Nor the price of the redemption of his soul: * and shall labour for ever, and shall still live unto the end.
48:9 He shall not see destruction, when he shall see the wise dying: * the senseless and the fool shall perish together:
48:10 And they shall leave their riches to strangers: * and their sepulchres shall be their houses for ever.
48:11 Their dwelling places to all generations: * they have called their lands by their names.
48:12 And man when he was in honour did not understand; * he is compared to senseless beasts, and is become like to them.
48:14 This way of theirs is a stumbling block to them: * and afterwards they shall delight in their mouth.
48:15 They are laid in hell like sheep: * death shall feed upon them.
48:16 And the just shall have dominion over them in the morning; * and their help shall decay in hell from their glory.
48:17 But God will redeem my soul from the hand of hell, * when he shall receive me.
48:18 Be not thou afraid, when a man shall be made rich, * and when the glory of his house shall be increased.
48:19 For when he shall die he shall take nothing away; * nor shall his glory descend with him.
48:20 For in his lifetime his soul will be blessed: * and he will praise thee when thou shalt do well to him.
48:21 He shall go in to the generations of his fathers: * and he shall never see light.
48:21 Man when he was in honour did not understand: * he hath been compared to senseless beasts, and made like to them.
