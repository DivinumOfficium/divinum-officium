6:1 Lord, rebuke me not in thy indignation, * nor chastise me in thy wrath.
6:2 Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am weak: * heal me, O Lord, for my bones are troubled.
6:3 And my soul is troubled exceedingly: * but thou, O Lord, how long?
6:4 Turn to me, O Lord, and deliver my soul: * O save me for thy mercy’s sake.
6:5 For there is no one in death, that is mindful of thee: * and who shall confess to thee in hell?
6:6 I have laboured in my groanings, every night I will wash my bed: * I will water my couch with my tears.
6:7 My eye is troubled through indignation: * I have grown old amongst all my enemies.
6:8 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity: * for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping.
6:9 The Lord hath heard my supplication: * the Lord hath received my prayer.
6:10 Let all my enemies be ashamed, and be very much troubled: * let them be turned back, and be ashamed very speedily.
