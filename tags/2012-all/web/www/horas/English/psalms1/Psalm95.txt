95:1 Sing ye to the Lord a new canticle: * sing to the Lord, all the earth.
95:2 Sing ye to the Lord and bless his name: * shew forth his salvation from day to day.
95:3 Declare his glory among the Gentiles: * his wonders among all people.
95:4 For the Lord is great, and exceedingly to be praised: * he is to be feared above all gods.
95:5 For all the gods of the Gentiles are devils: * but the Lord made the heavens.
95:6 Praise and beauty are before him: * holiness and majesty in his sanctuary.
95:7 Bring ye to the Lord, O ye kindreds of the Gentiles, bring ye to the Lord glory and honour: * bring to the Lord glory unto his name.
95:8 Bring up sacrifices, and come into his courts: * adore ye the Lord in his holy court.
95:9 Let all the earth be moved at his presence. * Say ye among the Gentiles, the Lord hath reigned.
95:10 For he hath corrected the world, which shall not be moved: * he will judge the people with justice.
95:11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad, let the sea be moved, and the fulness thereof: * the fields and all things that are in them shall be joyful.
95:12 Then shall all the trees of the woods rejoice before the face of the Lord, because he cometh: * because he cometh to judge the earth.
95:13 He shall judge the world with justice, * and the people with his truth.
