(Canticle of_Isaias * Isa 12:1-7)
12:1 I will give thanks to thee, O Lord, for thou wast angry with me: * thy wrath is turned away, and thou hast comforted me.
12:2 Behold, God is my saviour, * I will deal confidently, and will not fear:
12:3 Because the Lord is my strength, and my praise, * and he is become my salvation.
12:4 You shall draw waters with joy out of the saviour’s fountains: * And you shall say in that day: Praise ye the Lord, and call upon his name:
12:5 Make his works known among the people: * remember that his name is high.
12:6 Sing ye to the Lord, for he hath done great things: * shew this forth in all the earth.
12:7 Rejoice, and praise, O thou habitation of Sion: * for great is he that is in the midst of thee the Holy One of Israel.
