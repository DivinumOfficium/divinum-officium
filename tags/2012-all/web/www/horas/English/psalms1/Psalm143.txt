143:1 Blessed be the Lord my God, who teacheth my hands to fight, * and my fingers to war.
143:2 My mercy, and my refuge: * my support, and my deliverer:
143:3 My protector, and I have hoped in him: * who subdueth my people under me.
143:4 Lord, what is man, that thou art made known to him? * or the son of man, that thou makest account of him?
143:5 Man is like to vanity: * his days pass away like a shadow.
143:6 Lord, bow down thy heavens and descend: * touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
143:7 Send forth lightning, and thou shalt scatter them: * shoot out thy arrows, and thou shalt trouble them.
143:8 Put forth thy hand from on high, take me out, and deliver me from many waters: * from the hand of strange children:
143:8 Whose mouth hath spoken vanity: * and their right hand is the right hand of iniquity.
143:9 To thee, O God, I will sing a new canticle: * on the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings I will sing praises to thee.
143:10 Who givest salvation to kings: * who hast redeemed thy servant David from the malicious sword: Deliver me,
143:11 And rescue me out of the hand of strange children; whose mouth hath spoken vanity: * and their right hand is the right hand of iniquity:
143:12 Whose sons are as new plants * in their youth:
143:13 Their daughters decked out, * adorned round about after the similitude of a temple:
143:14 Their storehouses full, * flowing out of this into that.
143:15 Their sheep fruitful in young, abounding in their goings forth: * their oxen fat.
143:15 There is no breach of wall, nor passage, * nor crying out in their streets.
143:15 They have called the people happy, that hath these things: * but happy is that people whose God is the Lord.
