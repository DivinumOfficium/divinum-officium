80:1 Rejoice O God our helper: * sing aloud to the God of Jacob.
80:2 Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel: * the pleasant psaltery with the harp.
80:3 Blow up the trumpet on the new moon, * on the noted day of your solemnity.
80:4 For it is a commandment in Israel, * and a judgment to the God of Jacob.
80:5 He ordained it for a testimony in Joseph, when he came out of the land of Egypt: * he heard a tongue which he knew not.
80:6 He removed his back from the burdens: * his hands had served in baskets.
80:7 Thou calledst upon me in affliction, and I delivered thee: * I heard thee in the secret place of tempest: I proved thee at the waters of contradiction.
80:8 Hear, O my people, and I will testify to thee: * O Israel, if thou wilt hearken to me; there shall be no new god in thee: neither shalt thou adore a strange god.
80:9 For I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt: * open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.
80:10 But my people heard not my voice: * and Israel hearkened not to me.
80:11 So I let them go according to the desires of their heart: * they shall walk in their own inventions.
80:12 If my people had heard me: * if Israel had walked in my ways:
80:13 I should soon have humbled their enemies, * and laid my hand on them that troubled them.
80:14 The enemies of the Lord have lied to him: * and their time shall be for ever.
80:15 And he fed them with the fat of wheat, * and filled them with honey out of the rock.
