25:1 Judge me, O Lord, for I have walked in my innocence: * and I have put my trust in the Lord, and shall not be weakened.
25:2 Prove me, O Lord, and try me; * burn my reins and my heart.
25:3 For thy mercy is before my eyes; * and I am well pleased with thy truth.
25:4 I have not sat with the council of vanity: * neither will I go in with the doers of unjust things.
25:5 I have hated the assembly of the malignant; * and with the wicked I will not sit.
25:6 I will wash my hands among the innocent; * and will compass thy altar, O Lord:
25:7 That I may hear the voice of thy praise: * and tell of all thy wondrous works.
25:8 I have loved, O Lord, the beauty of thy house; * and the place where thy glory dwelleth.
25:9 Take not away my soul, O God, with the wicked: * nor my life with bloody men:
25:10 In whose hands are iniquities: * their right hand is filled with gifts.
25:11 But as for me, I have walked in my innocence: * redeem me, and have mercy on me.
25:12 My foot hath stood in the direct way: * in the churches I will bless thee, O Lord.
