[Lectio4]
Clement, the son of Faustinus, was a Roman, from the quarter of the Coelian~
Mount. He was a disciple of the blessed Peter, and is the same concerning whom~
Paul saith, writing to the Philippians And I entreat thee also, true yokefellow,~
help those women which laboured with me in the Gospel, with Clement also, and~
with other my fellow-labourers, whose names are written in the book of life.~
~(iv. 3.) (He succeeded Cletus as Bishop of Rome.) He it was who divided the~
seven quarters of the city among seven scribes, one to each, whose duty it was~
to search out most carefully, and record in writing the sufferings and acts of~
the Martyrs. He himself also wrote much, and that most orthodox and healthy,~
whereby he clearly explained the Christian Religion.

[Lectio5]
His teaching and the holiness of his life brought many to believe in Christ, and~
he was therefore exiled by the Emperor Trajan to Kherson, in the Crimea, where~
he found two thousand Christians, who had been condemned by the same Trajan.~
There they all worked in the marble quarries. During their labour they suffered~
for want of water, and Clement prayed, and then went up an hill hard by, on the~
top whereof he saw a Lamb standing, touching with its right foot a flowing~
spring of sweet waters. Therewith they all quenched their thirst, and by this~
miracle many unbelievers were brought to believe in Christ, and began to honour~
the holiness of Clement.

[Lectio6]
These things moved Trajan to send a messenger to the Crimea, who tied an~
anchor about Clement's neck, and cast him into the deep of the sea. After it had~
been done, while the Christians were praying on the shore, the sea went back~
three miles, and when they followed it, they found a grotto of marble, in form~
like a temple, and therein a stone coffin wherein was laid the body of the~
Martyr, and, hard by, the anchor wherewith he had been sunk. Then were the~
country people moved to receive the faith of Christ. The body of Clement was~
afterwards brought to Rome, in the time of Pope Nicholas I., and buried in his~
own Church. A Church was also built in the Crimea, in the place where God had~
made the water to break forth. Clement lived as Pope nine years, six months, and~
six days. He held two Ordinations in the month of December, wherein he made ten~
Priests, two Deacons, and fifteen Bishops for divers places.

[Ant Laudes]
While St. Clement prayed, * there appeared unto him the Lamb of God.
Not for my own merits * hath the Lord sent me unto you, that I may share your crowns.
I saw on the mountain * the Lamb standing, from beneath whosefoot flowed a fountain of living waters.
From beneath whose foot * a fountain of living waters flowed forth: the stream of the river that maketh glad the city of God.
All the nations * round about believed in Christ the Lord.
[Ant 2]
As he began to move toward the sea * the people cried out with a loud voice : O~
Lord Jesus Christ, deliver him! And Clement wept, and said : Father, receive my~
spirit!

!Matt 24:42-45
24:42 Watch ye therefore, because ye know not what hour your Lord will come.
24:43 But know this ye, that if the goodman of the house knew at what hour the thief would come, he would certainly watch, and would not suffer his house to be broken open.
24:44 Wherefore be you also ready, because at what hour you know not the Son of man will come.
24:45 Who, thinkest thou, is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath appointed over his family, to give them meat in season.
