From the Acts of Apostles.
!Acts 2:1-8
1 And when the days of the Pentecost were accomplished, they were all together~
in one place:
2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a mighty wind coming, and~
it filled the whole house where they were sitting.
3 And there appeared to them parted tongues as it were of fire, and it sat upon~
every one of them:
4 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they began to speak with~
divers tongues, according as the Holy Ghost gave them to speak.
5 Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem, Jews, devout men, out of every nation~
under heaven.
6 And when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were~
confounded in mind, because that every man heard them speak in his own tongue.
7 And they were all amazed, and wondered, saying: Behold, are not all these,~
that speak, Galileans?
8 And how have we heard, every man our own tongue wherein we were born?

!Acts 2:14-21
14 But Peter standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and spoke to~
them: Ye men of Judea, and all you that dwell in Jerusalem, be this known to you,~
and with your ears receive my words.
15 For these are not drunk, as you suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of~
the day:
16 But this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel:
17 And it shall come to pass, in the last days, (saith the Lord,) I will pour~
out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,~
and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.
18 And upon my servants indeed, and upon my handmaids will I pour out in those~
days of my spirit, and they shall prophesy.
19 And I will show wonders in the heaven above, and signs on the earth beneath:~
blood and fire, and vapour of smoke.
20 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the~
great and manifest day of the Lord come.
21 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call upon the name of the~
Lord, shall be saved.

[Lectio3]
!Acts 2:22-27
22 Ye men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God~
among you, by miracles, and wonders, and signs, which God did by him, in the~
midst of you, as you also know:
23 This same being delivered up, by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of~
God, you by the hands of wicked men have crucified and slain.
24 Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the sorrows of hell, as it was~
impossible that he should be holden by it.
25 For David saith concerning him: I foresaw the Lord before my face: because he~
is at my right hand, that I may not be moved.
26 For this my heart hath been glad, and any tongue hath rejoiced: moreover my~
flesh also shall rest in hope.
27 Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, nor suffer thy Holy One to see~
corruption.
