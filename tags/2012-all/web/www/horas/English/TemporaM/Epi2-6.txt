Lesson from the second letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians
!2 Cor 13:1-4
1 Behold, this is the third time I am coming to you: In the mouth of two or~
three witnesses shall every word stand.
2 I have told before, and foretell, as present, and now absent, to them that~
sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I come again, I will not spare.
3 Do you seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me, who towards you is not weak,~
but is mighty in you?
4 For although he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of~
God. For we also are weak in him: but we shall live with him by the power of God~
towards you.

!2 Cor 13:5-9
5 Try your own selves if you be in the faith; prove ye yourselves. Know you not~
your own selves, that Christ Jesus is in you, unless perhaps you be reprobates?
6 But I trust that you shall know that we are not reprobates.
7 Now we pray God, that you may do no evil, not that we may appear approved, but~
that you may do that which is good, and that we may be as reprobates.
8 For we can do nothing against the truth; but for the truth.
9 For we rejoice that we are weak, and you are strong. This also we pray for,~
your perfection.

!2 Cor 13:10-13
10 Therefore I write these things, being absent, that, being present, I may not~
deal more severely, according to the power which the Lord hath given me unto~
edification, and not unto destruction.
11 For the rest, brethren, rejoice, be perfect, take exhortation, be of one mind,~
have peace; and the God of peace and of love shall be with you.
12 Salute one another with a holy kiss. All the saints salute you.
13 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the charity of God, and the~
communication of the Holy Ghost be with you all. Amen.
