[Lectio1]
From the Book of Ecclesiastes
!Eccl 7:1-3
1 What needeth a man to seek things that are above him, whereas he knoweth not~
what is profitable for him in his life, in all the days of his pilgrimage, and~
the time that passeth like a shadow? Or who can tell him what shall be after him~
under the sun?
2 A good name is better than precious ointments: and the day of death than the~
day of one's birth.
3 It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to the house of feasting:~
for in that we are put in mind of the end of all, and the living thinketh what~
is to come.

!Eccl 7:4-9
4 Anger is better than laughter: because by the sadness of the countenance the~
mind of the offender is corrected.
5 The heart of the wise is where there is mourning, and the heart of fools where~
there is mirth.
6 It is better to be rebuked by a wise man, than to be deceived by the flattery~
of fools.
7 For as the crackling of thorns burning under a pot, so is the laughter of a~
fool: now this also is vanity.
8 Oppression troubleth the wise, and shall destroy the strength of his heart.
9 Better is the end of a speech than the beginning. Better is the patient man~
than the presumptuous.

!Eccl 7:11-14
11 Say not: What thinkest thou is the cause that former times were better than~
they are now? for this manner of question is foolish.
12 Wisdom with riches is more profitable, and bringeth more advantage to them~
that see the sun.
13 For as wisdom is a defence, so money is a defence: but learning and wisdom~
excel in this, that they give life to him that possesseth them.
14 Consider the works of God, that no man can correct whom he hath despised.
