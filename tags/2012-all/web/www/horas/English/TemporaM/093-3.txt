From the Holy Gospel according to Mark
!Mark 9:16-28
At that time One of the multitude answered and said unto Jesus Master, I~
have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit. And so on.
_
Homily by the Venerable Bede, Priest (at Jarrow.)
!Bk. iii. ch. 38, on Mark ix.
Concerning this possessed person whom the Lord healed, after that He was come~
down from the mount, Mark saith that he was deaf and dumb, and Matthew (xvii.~
15) that he was lunatic. He was a figure of them of whom it is said A fool~
changeth as the moon, (Ecclus. xxvii. 12.) These are they who continue never in~
one stay, but change now to one sin, and now to another, waxing and waning dumb,~
in that they confess not the faith deaf, in that they have no ears for the~
word of truth. They foam at the mouth also, and pine away with folly. For it is~
the way with idiots, and swooners, and stupified, to foam their spittle out at~
their mouths. They gnash their teeth when they are inflamed with the heat of~
passion. They wither up in the paralysis of sloth and live nerveless lives~
unbraced by any strong exercise.

The father saith: And I spake to thy disciples, that they should cast him out,~
and they could not. Here he maketh a sort of accusation against the Apostles.~
But that cures cannot be wrought is sometimes owing, not to the powerlessness of~
them that would heal, but to the want of faith in them that are to be healed as~
saith the Lord According to your faith be it unto you. (Matth. ix. 29.) He~
answereth him, and saith O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you~
The meek and lowly One, Who, as a lamb before his shearers, is dumb, so opened~
not His Mouth, was not wearied out of patience, nor did He break out into words~
of passion, but He spake as a physician might speak, who saw that the sick man~
did contrary to his commands. Wherefore should I come unto thine house How~
long am I to throw away the exercise of my skill, while I order one thing and~
thou dost another

And He said unto them This kind can come forth by nothing but by prayer and~
fasting. While He teacheth the Apostles how the very worst kind of devil must be~
driven out, He giveth unto all of us an instruction unto life, that we may know~
that the most grievous trials, either from unclean spirits, or from men, are to~
be overcome by fasting and prayer. The wrath of the Lord also, when it is~
kindled to take vengeance of our sins, can be turned away by this remedy only.~
To fast, in a general sense, is not only to abstain from meats, but to restrain~
oneself from all the inticements of the flesh, and from all evil passions. So~
also, to pray, is not only to call in words for the mercy of God, but also, in~
all things which we do, in earnestness of faith to worship our Maker.

V. We are filled in the morning with thy mercy:
R. And we have rejoiced, and are delighted

[Ant 2]
This kind of devils * can come forth by nothing but by prayer and fasting.

[Oratio]
WE pray thee, O Lord, that the healing power of thy mercy may give strength to~
our weakness, that those things which do pass away by their own frailty, may be~
renewed again by thy clemency.

v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Mark
!Mark 9:16-28
9:16 And one of the multitude, answering, said: Master, I have brought my son to thee, having a dumb spirit.
9:17 Who, wheresoever he taketh him, dasheth him, and he foameth, and gnasheth with the teeth, and pineth away; and I spoke to thy disciples to cast him out, and they could not.
9:18 Who answering them, said: O incredulous generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me.
9:19 And they brought him. And when he had seen him, immediately the spirit troubled him; and being thrown down upon the ground, he rolled about foaming.
9:20 And he asked his father: How long time is it since this hath happened unto him? But he said: From his infancy:
9:21 And oftentimes hath he cast him into the fire and into waters to destroy him. But if thou canst do any thing, help us, having compassion on us.
9:22 And Jesus saith to him: If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.
9:23 And immediately the father of the boy crying out, with tears said: I do believe, Lord: help my unbelief.
9:24 And when Jesus saw the multitude running together, he threatened the unclean spirit, saying to him: Deaf and dumb spirit, I command thee, go out of him; and enter not any more into him.
9:25 And crying out, and greatly tearing him, he went out of him, and he became as dead, so that many said: He is dead.
9:26 But Jesus taking him by the hand, lifted him up; and he arose.
9:27 And when he was come into the house, his disciples secretly asked him: Why could not we cast him out?
9:28 And he said to them: This kind can go out by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.
