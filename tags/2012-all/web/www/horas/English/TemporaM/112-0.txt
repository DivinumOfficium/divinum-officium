From the Prophet Ezechiel
!Ezek 21:1-5
1 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
2 Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and let thy speech flow towards the~
holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel:
3 And say to the land of Israel: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I come against~
thee, and I will draw forth my sword out of its sheath, and will cut off in thee~
the just, and the wicked.
4 And forasmuch as I have cut off in thee the just, and the wicked, therefore~
shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh, from the south even~
to the north.
5 That all flesh may know that I the Lord have drawn my sword out of its sheath~
not to be turned back.

!Ezek 1:6-11
6 Every one had four faces, and every one four wings.
7 Their feet were straight feet, and the sole of their foot was like the sole of a~
calf's foot, and they sparkled like the appearance of glowing brass.
8 And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides: and~
they bad faces, and wings on the four sides,
9 And the wings of one were joined to the wings of another. They turned not when~
they went: but every one went straight forward.
10 And as for the likeness of their faces: there was the face of a man, and the~
face of a lion on the right side of all the four: and the face of an ox, on the~
left side of all the four: and the face of an eagle over all the four.
11 And their faces, and their wings were stretched upward: two wings of every~
one were joined, and two covered their bodies:

!Ezek 1:12-15
12 And every one of them went straight forward: whither the impulse of the~
spirit was to go, thither they went: and they turned not when they went.
13 And as for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like~
that of burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps. This was the~
vision running to and fro in the midst of the living creatures, a bright fire,~
and lightning going forth from the fire.
14 And the living creatures ran and returned like flashes of lightning.
15 Now as I beheld the living creatures, there appeared upon the earth by the~
living creatures one wheel with four faces.

From the Exposition of the Prophet Ezekiel, written by St Jerome, Priest (at~
Bethlehem.)
!Bk. vii. on Ez. xxi.
In the foregoing chapter it is written Son of man, set thy face toward the way~
of Theman, and drop thy word toward Darom, and prophesy against the forest of~
the field of Nageb. And say to the forest of Nageb Hear the word of the Lord~
Thus saith the Lord God Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall~
devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree the flaming flame shall~
not be quenched, and all faces from Negab to Tsaphon shall be burned therein.~
And all flesh shall see that I the Lord have kindled it it shall not be~
quenched. Then said I Ah, Lord God they say of me, Doth he not speak~
parables? (xx. 46-49.) But now, as the people asked for something clearer, the~
Lord doth speak more openly that which He had uttered in what is diversely~
called metaphor, parable, or proverb He showeth how that the forest of the~
field of Nageb, and Darom, and Theman, are figures of Jerusalem, and the Temple,~
and the Holy-of-Holies, and of all the land of Judah, and that by the flaming~
fire which should devour the forest, was to be understood that sword, which~
should be drawn out of the sheath, and should cut off from the land of Israel~
the righteous and the wicked. The righteous and the wicked are figured by the~
green tree and the dry tree. Whence also the Lord saith If they do these~
things in a green tree, what shall be done in a dry? (Luke xxiii. 31.)

The first time He had said: Set thy face toward the South, and drop thy word~
toward the South wind, and prophesy against the forest of the South. But~
forasmuch as this seemed dark, and the people knew not what the Prophet said, it~
is a second time stated more clearly that the forest of the South is Jerusalem~
and all its unfruitful trees, unto whose roots the axe is being laid, are to be~
understood as figures of her inhabitants and the fire to be kindled in it, to~
be interpreted the sword. A third time l is the Prophet commanded that when they~
should hold their peace, nor ask wherefore he prophesied thus, he should do that~
by which he should be questioned, and should answer that which the Lord had~
spoken.

Sigh thou, He saith, cry aloud, not softly nor only half sorrowfully, but with~
the breaking of thy loins, that thy groaning may come from the depth of thy~
bowels and from the bitterness of thy soul. And this shalt thou do before them.~
And when they shall ask thee wherefore thou art afflicted with such lamentation,~
and what evil hath befallen thee that thou groanest thus, thou shalt answer them~
with My word, saying I lament, and am not able to hide the grief of mine heart,~
because that that which hath ever sounded in mine ears will indeed be fulfilled,~
and cometh, even the host of the wrathful Babylonians which threateneth you~
and when it shall have come, and shall have made trenches all round about~
Jerusalem, then every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and~
horror shall take hold of the minds of men, and none shall dare to withstand.
