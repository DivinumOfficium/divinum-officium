From the holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 25:31-46
In that time Jesus said to his disciples: When the Son of man shall come in his~
majesty, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit upon the seat of his~
majesty. And all nations shall be gathered together before him. And so on.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!On Faith and Works, xv. 4.
If, without keeping the commandments, it be possible to attain unto life by~
faith only, (and faith, if it hath not works, is dead, James ii. 17,) how can~
it be true that the Lord will say to such as He shall have set on His left hand~
Depart from Me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his~
angels? He rebuketh them, not because they have not believed in Him, but~
because they have not wrought good works. Yea, lest any man should promise~
himself life eternal by faith only, (and faith, if it hath not works, is dead,)~
the Lord saith that He will gather together all nations, nations who have lived~
mingled together in the same countries, that we may seem to hear them which have~
believed indeed in Him, but have not wrought good works, (as though that their~
dead faith could, being alone, lead them into life eternal,) that we may seem to~
hear such crying unto Him,  Lord, when saw we thee suffering such and such~
things, and did not minister unto thee?

If they shall go into everlasting fire A who have not done works of mercy, shall~
not they go who have taken their neighbour's goods? Or shall not they go who~
have outraged the temple of God in their own selves, and so been merciless to~
themselves? As if works of mercy could avail anything without love, contrary to~
the words of the Apostle Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and~
have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. (1 Cor. xiii. 3.) And what manner of~
love to his neighbour hath he who loveth him as himself and loveth not himself?~
remembering that he that loveth iniquity hateth his own soul. (Ps. x. 6.)

Neither dare we say here that by which some delude themselves, namely, that the~
fire indeed is everlasting, but that they will not burn therein everlastingly.~
Such men say that they whose faith is dead, will pass through that everlasting~
fire, and that they are they to whom it is promised that they themselves shall~
be saved, yet so as by fire. (1 Cor. iii. 15.) So that, though the fire itself~
be everlasting, the burning of the damned therein, that is, the work of the fire~
upon them, will not be everlasting. As though the Lord were answering this~
beforehand, the last words of His Sermon are And these shall go away into~
everlasting punishment, but the righteous into life eternal. As the fire, so~
shall the burning be; and the Truth biddeth us know that they shall burn therein,~
who have lacked, not faith, but good works.

v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 25:31-46
25:31 And when the Son of man shall come in his majesty, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit upon the seat of his majesty.
25:32 And all nations shall be gathered together before him, and he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats:
25:33 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.
25:34 Then shall the king say to them that shall be on his right hand: Come, ye blessed of my Father, possess you the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
25:35 For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me to drink; I was a stranger, and you took me in:
25:36 Naked, and you covered me: sick, and you visited me: I was in prison, and you came to me.
25:37 Then shall the just answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see thee hungry, and fed thee; thirsty, and gave thee drink?
25:38 And when did we see thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and covered thee?
25:39 Or when did we see thee sick or in prison, and came to thee?
25:40 And the king answering, shall say to them: Amen I say to you, as long as you did it to one of these my least brethren, you did it to me.
25:41 Then he shall say to them also that shall be on his left hand: Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels.
25:42 For I was hungry, and you gave me not to eat: I was thirsty, and you gave me not to drink.
25:43 I was a stranger, and you took me not in: naked, and you covered me not: sick and in prison, and you did not visit me.
25:44 Then they also shall answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to thee?
25:45 Then he shall answer them, saying: Amen I say to you, as long as you did it not to one of these least, neither did you do it to me.
25:46 And these shall go into everlasting punishment: but the just, into life everlasting.
