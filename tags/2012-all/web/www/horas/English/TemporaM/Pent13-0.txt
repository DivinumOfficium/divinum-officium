From the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 17:11-19
It came to pass, as Jesus went to Jerusalem, that He passed through the midst of~
Samaria and Galilee. And, as He entered into a certain village, there met Him~
ten men that were lepers. And so on.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop of Hippo
!Bk. ii. Gospel Questions, ch. 40.
The ten lepers "lifted up their voices and said Jesus, Master, have mercy on~
us. And when He saw them, He said unto them Go, show yourselves unto the~
Priests. And it came to pass that, as they went, they were cleansed." Question~
why did the Lord send them unto the Priests, that, as they went, they might be~
cleansed Lepers were the only class among those upon whose bodies He worked~
mercy, whom we find that He sent unto the Priests. It is written in another~
place that He said to a leper whom He had cleansed " Go, and show thyself to~
the Priest, and offer for thy cleansing according as Moses commanded, for a~
testimony unto them" (Luke v. 14, Lev. xiv.  seq.) We ask then, of what leprosy was a type, whereof they that were~
ridded were called, not "healed," but " cleansed." It is a disease which doth~
first appear in the skin, but destroyeth not immediately the strength, nor the~
use of feeling and the limbs.

[Lectio8]
The lepers, therefore, we may not absurdly suppose such to be figured as have~
not the knowledge of the true faith, but do show forth divers parti-coloured~
teachings of error. They hide not their witlessness, but do use all such wit as~
they have to make it manifest, and proclaim it in highsounding phrases. There is~
no false doctrine but hath some truth mixed up with it. A man's discourse then,~
with some truths in it unequally mingled with falsehoods, and all confounded in~
one mass, is like to the body of one that is stricken with leprosy, whereon all~
manner of foul colours do appear in this and that place along with the true~
colour of skin.

[Lectio9]
Such men as these are banished out of the walls of the Church, to the end that~
haply when they stand afar off they may lift up their voices and cry to Christ~
for pardon, just as those ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off,~
outside the village, lifted up their voices and said "Jesus, Master, have~
mercy on us." That they styled Him Master, by which title I know not if any~
besought the Lord for bodily healing, I think doth sufficiently show that~
leprosy signifieth false doctrine, whereof the Good Master doth cleanse us.

[Ant 2]
As Jesus passed through * a certain village, there met Him ten men that were~
lepers, which stood afar off; and they lifted up their voices, and said "Jesus,~
Master, have mercy on us."

[Versum 2]
V. The Lord reigneth He is clothed with majesty.
R. The Lord is clothed with strength, and hath girded Himself with power.

[Ant 3]
And one of them, * when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud~
voice glorified God. Alleluia.

[Versum 3]
V. Let my prayer, O Lord, be set forth.
R. As incense before thee.

Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 17:11-19
17:11 And it came to pass, as he was going to Jerusalem, he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.
17:12 And as he entered into a certain town, there met him ten men that were lepers, who stood afar off;
17:13 And lifted up their voice, saying: Jesus, master, have mercy on us.
17:14 Whom when he saw, he said: Go, shew yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass, as they went, they were made clean.
17:15 And one of them, when he saw that he was made clean, went back, with a loud voice glorifying God.
17:16 And he fell on his face before his feet, giving thanks: and this was a Samaritan.
17:17 And Jesus answering, said, Were not ten made clean? and where are the nine?
17:18 There is no one found to return and give glory to God, but this stranger.
17:19 And he said to him: Arise, go thy way; for thy faith hath made thee whole.
