From the Prophet Joel
!Joel  3:1-3
1  For behold in those days, and in that time when I shall bring back the captivity of Juda and Jerusalem:
2  I will gather together all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Josaphat: and I will plead with them there for my people, and for my inheritance Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and have parted my land.
3  And they have cast lots upon my people: and the boy they have put in the stews, and the girl they have sold for wine, that they might drink.

!Joel 3:4-7
4  But what have you to do with me, O Tyre, and Sidon, and all the coast of the Philistines? will you revenge yourselves on me? and if you revenge yourselves on me, I will very soon return you a recompense upon your own head.
5  For you have taken away my silver and my gold: and my desirable and most beautiful things you have carried into your temples.
6  And the children of Juda, and the children of Jerusalem you have sold to the children of the Greeks, that you might remove them far off from their own country.
7  Behold, I will raise them up out of the place wherein you have sold them: and I will return your recompense upon your own heads.

!Joel 3:8-12
8  And I will sell your sons, and your daughters by the hands of the children of Juda, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, a nation far off, for the Lord hath spoken it.
9  Proclaim ye this among the nations: prepare war, rouse up the strong: let them come, let all the men of war come up.
10  Cut your ploughshares into swords, and your spades into spears. Let the weak say: I am strong.
11  Break forth, and come, all ye nations, from round about, and gather yourselves together: there will the Lord cause all thy strong ones to fall down.
12  Let them arise, and let the nations come up into the valley of Josaphat: for there I will sit to judge all nations round about.
