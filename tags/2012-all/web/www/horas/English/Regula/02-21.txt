02-21# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 18: In What Order the Psalms Themselves Are to Be Said
_
First of all let the verse be said: “O God, make speed to save us; O Lord, make haste to help us” and the Gloria. Next the hymn proper to each hour. Then, at Lord’s day Prime are to be said four parts of the hundred and eighteenth psalm. And at the other hours, that is at Terce, Sext and None, let three parts of the said hundred and eighteenth psalm be said. But at Prime on Monday let three other psalms be said, namely, the first, the second and the sixth. And thus at Prime day by day up to the Lord’s day let the psalms be said in order, three each day, up to the nineteenth psalm; in such wise however that the ninth psalm and the seventeenth be apportioned to two Glorias. And so let it come to pass that at night office on the Lord’s day a beginning is always made with the twentieth psalm.
