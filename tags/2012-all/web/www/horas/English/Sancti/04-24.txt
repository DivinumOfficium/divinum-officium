[Oratio]
God, Who didst vouchsafe to enkindle in blessed Faithful the fire of thy~
Seraphim, and to glorify his toil to give men a true knowledge of thee by the~
palm-branch of martyrdom and by great signs and wonders, be entreated, we~
beseech thee, for his sake and by his prayers, and so establish us in the~
knowledge and love of thee, that we also, like him, may be found faithful even~
unto death in serving of thee.

[Lectio4]
Faithful was born of the respectable family of Rey in the town of Sigmaringen in~
Swabia, (in the year of our Lord 1577.) From his childhood he was adorned with~
many bright gifts of nature and grace. Intellectually distinguished, and~
assisted by all the advantages of education, he took at Fribourg the degrees of~
Philosophy and of Civil and Canon Law, and it was while engaged in these studies,~
that he began to strive after the height of perfection in the school of Christ,~
to which end he earnestly trained himself in all the exercises of godliness. He~
ceased not to exhort to Christian godliness, both by his words and works, the~
noblemen who made him their companion, and who were drawn from the chief~
families of divers parts of Europe. While on his travels, he was careful to~
mortify the lusts of the flesh by frequent austerities, and so to get the~
command of himself, that he was never seen under any circumstances to be moved~
to anger. He was a zealous champion of law and justice, and when he returned~
into Germany, he won a most distinguished name in his profession as an advocate.~
After a while, however, in view of the dangers which beset him at the Bar, he~
determined to enter on a path safer as regarded his eternal salvation, and, in~
obedience to an inward call from above, he sought admission into the Seraphic~
Order, among the Capuchin Friars Minor, (in the year 1612.)

[Lectio5]
After he had obtained his holy wish, he showed himself even in his noviceship a~
singular despiser of the world and of himself, and still more so when with great~
spiritual joy he had made his solemn profession to the Lord. By his observance~
of the Rule, he became the wonder and the example of all. He gave himself~
chiefly to prayer and sacred learning, but he excelled, by a remarkable~
grace, in the ministry of the Word, and thereby not only stirred up the~
Catholics to bring forth more fruit, but also drew misbelievers to the~
knowledge of the truth. He was set at the head of communities of Friars in~
divers places, and discharged the duty so laid upon him with great praise for~
prudence, justice, meekness, wisdom, and lowliness. He was animated by a~
vehement love of the strictest poverty, and cleansed the convent of whatever was~
not altogether needful. While he pursued himself with an healthy hatred, and~
most stern fastings, watchings, and scourgings, he showed to all others a love~
like the love of a mother for her sons. When a contagious fever made horrid~
ravages among the Austrian soldiers, he gave himself up with his whole soul to~
unwearied offices of tenderness toward the helpless sick. In allaying quarrels~
and relieving the temporal distress of his neighbour, he bore himself with such~
wisdom and zeal as to earn the name of Father of his country.

[Lectio6]
Tenderly and warmly loved the maiden Mother of God and her Rosary, and he~
besought God under the patronage of many of His holy servants, but especially~
under that of the same blessed Mother, to vouchsafe to let him offer his life~
and his blood together for the sake of the Catholic faith. This burning desire~
came upon him more and more, day by day, as he celebrated with great ardour of~
spirit the Holy Liturgy and by the unexpected Providence of God it came to pass~
that this brave He was a travelling tutor. soldier of Christ was chosen~
President of the Missions which the Congregation for the Propagation of the~
Faith had at that time just founded for the Grisons. He accepted this hard task~
with a willing and joyful heart, and discharged it with such zeal, that many~
heretics were turned to the orthodox faith, and great hope was engendered that~
the whole of that people would return to the peace of Christ and His Church.~
Faithful, who was gifted with the spirit of Prophecy, often foretold the great~
woes which afterwards came upon the Grisons, and that he himself would be~
murdered by the heretics. At last, on a certain 23rd of April, some of the~
heretics, who pretended to be converted, entreated him to come and preach the~
following day at the Church of a place which is called Sevis. He complied with~
the treacherous invitation, but, as he knew that plots were being laid against~
him, he had made himself ready beforehand for the last conflict. On the 24th day~
of April, in the year 1622, he went to Sevis, and began to preach, but his~
discourse was interrupted by a riot, and on his way back, he was [met by a party~
of Calvinists, and) brutally murdered. By this glorious death, which he suffered~
with a willing and cheerful heart, he offered to God in his own blood the~
first-fruits of martyrdom from the above - mentioned Congregation. God hath~
since glorified him by many signs and wonders, especially at Coire and~
Feldkirchen, where his reliques are kept with much popular veneration.

[Lectio94]
Fidelis was born of a good family called Rey at Sigmaringen in Swabia, and gained a famous name for himself in legal work. But when experience shewed him its dangers, he abandoned it and, enlightened by a call from heaven, asked to be admitted among the Capuchins. When he had taken his vows, he was an inspiration and example to all by his observance of the rule and zealously promoted the cult of the Virgin Mother of God and of the Rosary. He asked God that he might die as a martyr for the Catholic faith, and this was granted him. For he was appointed leader of the missions which the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith had established at this time for the Grisons and, since he spared himself no toil and converted many heretics to Christ, he incurred the hatred of evil men. So, on the 24th of April in the year 1622, at a church in a place called Sevis, he was struck down with blows and wounds by some heretics who had deceitfully invited him to meet them, pretending to be converts. And thus he consecrated with his own blood the first-fruits of the Martyrs of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith.
