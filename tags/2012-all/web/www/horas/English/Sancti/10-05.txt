!Commemoratio Ss. Placidi et Sociorum Martyrum
Placidus was the son of Tertullus, one of the noblest persons of Rome. He was~
offered to God (by his father) when a child (only seven years of age) and~
given over to holy Benedict, in whose teaching and Rule of monks he so profited~
that he was reckoned among the chiefest of his disciples. By him he was sent~
into Sicily, where he founded near the Port of Messina a Church and monastery in~
honour of St John the Baptist, and lived therein with his monks in wonderful~
holiness. Thither there came to see him his brothers Eutychius and Victorinus~
and his virgin sister Flavia, and while they were together, there landed there a~
certain brutal pirate, named Manucha, who took the monastery, and when he could~
in no wise prevail upon Placidus and the others to deny Christ, he commanded him,~
his brothers, and his sister to be cruelly murdered. With them Donatus, Firmatus a~
Deacon, Faustus, and thirty other monks brought the conflict of testimony to the~
blessed end of martyrdom, upon the fifth day of October, in the year of~
salvation 539
