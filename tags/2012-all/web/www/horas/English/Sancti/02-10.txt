[Oratio]
O God, Who, to show the way of the undefiled, wast pleased that the soul of thy~
blessed Virgin Scholastica should fly to heaven in a bodily shape, like a dove,~
mercifully grant unto us thy servants, for her sake, and at her petition,~
worthily to attain unto thine everlasting joy.
$Per Dominum

[Lectio4]
From the Second Book of the Dialogues of Pope St Gregory (the Great.)
!Ch. 33.
The worshipful Scholastica, the sister of our Father Benedict, was hallowed~
unto the Lord Almighty from a child. Her custom was to come to see her brother~
once every year. And when she came, the man of God went down unto her, not far~
from the gate, but, as it were, within the borders of his monastery. And there~
was a day when she came, as her custom was, and her worshipful brother went down~
to her, and his disciples with him. Then they passed the whole day together,~
praising God, and speaking one to the other of spiritual things. And when the~
night came, they brake bread together. And while they were yet at table, and~
conversed together on spiritual things, the hour was late. Then the holy woman~
his sister besought him, saying Leave me not, I pray thee, this night, but~
let us speak even until morning of the gladness of the eternal life. He answered~
her: What is it that thou sayest, my sister? I can by no means remain out of my~
cell. Now the firmament was so clear that there were no clouds in the sky. Then~
the holy nun, when she had heard the words of her brother, that he would not~
abide with her, clasped her hands on the table, and laid her face on her hands,~
and besought the Lord Almighty. And it came to pass that when she lifted up her~
head from the table, there were great thunderings and lightnings, and a flood of~
rain, insomuch that neither the worshipful Benedict nor the brethren that were~
with him could move as much as a foot over the threshold of the place where they~
sat.

[Lectio5]
Now when the holy woman laid her head in her hands upon the table, she wept~
bitterly, and as she wept, the clearness of the sky was turned to a tempest. As~
she prayed, immediately the flood followed. And the time was so, that she lifted~
up her head when it thundered, and when she had lifted up her head, the rain~
came. When the man of God saw that he could not return to his monastery, because~
of the lightnings, and thunderings, and the great rain, he was sorrowful and~
grieved, saying Almighty God forgive thee, my sister; what is this that thou~
hast done? She answered him Behold, I besought thee, and thou wouldest not~
hear; I besought my God, and He hath heard me; if, therefore, thou wilt, go~
forth, leave me alone, and go thy way to thy monastery. But he could not, and so~
he tarried in the same place, not willingly, but of necessity. And so it came to~
pass that they slept not all that night, but fed one another with discourse on~
spiritual things.

[Lectio6]
And when the morning was come, the worshipful woman arose, and went unto her own~
cell, and the man of God went back to his monastery. And, behold, after three~
days he was sitting in his cell, and he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and saw~
the soul of his sister, delivered from the body, fly to heaven in a bodily shape~
like a dove. Wherefore he rejoiced because of the glory that was revealed in her,~
and gave thanks to Almighty God in hymns and praises, and made known to the~
brethren that she was dead. He commanded them also to go and take up her body,~
and bring it to his monastery, and lay it in the grave which he had made ready~
for himself. Whereby it came to pass that they twain who had ever been of one~
mind in the Lord, even in death were not divided.

[Lectio94]
Scholastica, sister of the venerable Father, Benedict, had been~
consecrated to God in early childhood, as St. Gregory tells us in the second~
book of his Dialogue used to visit with Benedict once a year. On these occasions~
he would go down to meet her in a house belonging to the monastery a short~
distance from the entrance. On a certain day, a sudden downpour of rain,~
obtained from God by Scholastica just as darkness was setting in, made it~
impossible for her venerable brother to leave. And so they spent the entire~
night together and both of them derived great profit from the holy thoughts they~
exchanged about the interior life. The next morning Scholastica returned to her~
convent and Benedict to his monastery. Three days later he stood in his room~
looking up toward the sky, he beheld his sister's soul leaving her body and~
entering the heavenly court in the form of a dove. Then Benedict sent some of~
his brethren to bury her body in the tomb he had prepared for himself. The~
bodies of these two were now to share a common resting place, just as in their~
souls had always been one in God
