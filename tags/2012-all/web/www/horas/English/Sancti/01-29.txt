[Oratio]
O God, Who didst will that thy Blessed Confessor and Bishop Francis should~
become all things to all men, mercifully grant unto us, that we being filled~
with the sweetness of thy heavenly love, may so take to ourselves his~
admonitions and be succoured by his prayers, that in the end we may with him~
attain unto thine everlasting joy.

[Lectio4]
Francis was born of godly and noble parents, in the town of Sales, from which~
his family take their name of de Sales, (upon the 21st day of August, in the~
year of our Lord 1567.) In his childish years his staid and godly demeanour gave~
promise of his future sanctity. He received a liberal education as he grew up,~
and afterwards studied Philosophy and Theology at Paris. In order to the~
complete furnishing of his mind, he took the degree of Doctor of Laws, both~
Civil and Ecclesiastical, at Padua, with much distinction. He had already bound~
himself with a vow of perpetual virginity at Paris, and he renewed the same in~
the Holy House of Loreto. From this path of virtue, neither the temptations of~
the devil nor the allurements of the world ever induced him
to

He refused to be made Counsellor of the Parliament of Chambery, for which his~
family had obtained for him patents from the Duke of Savoy, and determined to~
become a clergyman. He was appointed to the Provostship of the Church of Geneva,~
and, being shortly afterwards ordained Priest, discharged so admirably the~
duties of his position, that he was sent by Granier, his Bishop, to preach the~
word of God in Chablais, and other places in the outskirts of the diocese, where~
the inhabitants had embraced the heresy of Calvin. He joyfully undertook this~
mission, in which he suffered much, being often hunted by the Protestants to~
murder him, and assailed by many calumnies and plots. Amid all these dangers and~
struggles his constancy remained invincible, and under the blessing and care of~
God he is said to have recalled seventy-two thousand of these heretics to the~
Faith of Christ's Universal Church, among whom were many distinguished by rank~
and learning.

[Lectio6]
After the death of Bishop Granier, who had procured his appointment as Coadjutor,~
he was consecrated Bishop, (upon the 3rd day of December, 1602.) In that office~
he was truly a burning and a shining light, showing all around a bright example~
of godliness, zeal for the discipline of the Church, ardent love of peace,~
tenderness to the poor, and, indeed, of all graces. For the greater ornament of~
God's worship he established a new Order of Nuns, which is named from the~
Visitation of the Blessed Virgin. These nuns follow the Rule of St Austin, but~
Francis added thereto several additional constitutions distinguished by wisdom,~
prudence, and tenderness. He enlightened the Church' by writings full of~
heavenly teaching, and pointing out a safe and simple road to Christian~
perfection. In the 55th year of his age, while on his way from France to Annecy,~
after saying mass at Lyons on the Feast of St John the Evangelist, he was seized~
with fatal illness, and on the next day passed from earth to heaven, in the year~
of our Lord 1622. His body was carried to Annecy and honourably buried in the~
Church of the nuns of the Visitation, where it soon began to be distinguished~
for miracles. The truth of these having been proved, the Supreme Pontiff,~
Alexander VI L, enrolled his name among those of the Saints, and appointed for~
his Feast-day the 29th of January. And the Supreme Pontiff, Pius IX., on the~
advice of the Congregation of Sacred Rites, declared him a Doctor of the~
Universal Church.

[Lectio94]
Francis was born of devout and noble parents in the town of Sales, from which~
his family took its name. He was given a liberal education, devoted himself to~
the study of philosophy and theology at Paris and gained the degree bi Doctor in~
civil and canon law at Padua. When he had been ordained priest and made provost~
of the church of Geneva, he carried out the duties of his office so well that~
Bishop de Granier sent him to preach the word of God in Chablais in order to win~
the inhabitants away from the heresy of Calvin. He undertook this mission with~
such great zeal and overcame so many dangers with the help of God that he is~
said to have brought back to the Catholic faith some seventy-two thousand~
heretics. When de Granier died, Francis was consecrated bishop. He founded a new~
order of nuns, named for the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin, and enlightened~
the Church with writings filled with heavenly teaching. At Lyons, he was seized~
by a grave illness and departed to heaven in the year 1622. He was declared a~
Doctor of the Universal Church by pope Pius IX.
