47:1 (A psalm of a canticle, for the sons of Core, on the second day of the week.)
47:2 Great is the Lord, and exceedingly to be praised in the city of our God, in his holy mountain.
47:3 With the joy of the whole earth is mount Sion founded, on the sides of the north, the city of the great king.
47:4 In her houses shall God be known, when he shall protect her.
47:5 For behold the kings of the earth assembled themselves: they gathered together.
47:6 So they saw, and they wondered, they were troubled, they were moved:
47:7 Trembling took hold of them. There were pains as of a woman in labour.
47:8 With a vehement wind thou shalt break in pieces the ships of Tharsis.
47:9 As we have heard, so have we seen, in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God: God hath founded it for ever.
47:10 We have received thy mercy, O God, in the midst of thy temple.
47:11 According to thy name, O God, so also is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of justice.
47:12 Let mount Sion rejoice, and the daughters of Juda be glad; because of thy judgments, O Lord.
47:13 Surround Sion, and encompass her: tell ye in her towers.
47:14 Set your hearts on her strength; and distribute her houses, that ye may relate it in another generation.
47:15 For this is God, our God unto eternity, and for ever and ever: he shall rule us for evermore.
