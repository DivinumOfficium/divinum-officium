96:1 (For the same David, when his land was restored again to him.) The Lord hath reigned, let the earth rejoice: let many islands be glad.
96:2 Clouds and darkness are round about him: justice and judgment are the establishment of his throne.
96:3 A fire shall go before him, and shall burn his enemies round about.
96:4 His lightnings have shone forth to the world: the earth saw and trembled.
96:5 The mountains melted like wax, at the presence of the Lord: at the presence of the Lord of all the earth.
96:6 The heavens declared his justice: and all people saw his glory.
96:7 Let them be all confounded that adore graven things, and that glory in their idols. Adore him, all you his angels:
96:8 Sion heard, and was glad. And the daughters of Juda rejoiced, because of thy judgments, O Lord.
96:9 For thou art the most high Lord over all the earth: thou art exalted exceedingly above all gods.
96:10 You that love the Lord, hate evil: the Lord preserveth the souls of his saints, he will deliver them out of the hand of the sinner.
96:11 Light is risen to the just, and joy to the right of heart.
96:12 Rejoice, ye just, in the Lord: and give praise to the remembrance of his holiness.
