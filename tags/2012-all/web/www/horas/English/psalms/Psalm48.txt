48:1 (Unto the end, a psalm for the sons of Core.)
48:2 Hear these things, all ye nations: give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world.
48:3 All you that are earthborn, and you sons of men: both rich and poor together.
48:4 My mouth shall speak wisdom: and the meditation of my heart understanding.
48:5 I will incline my ear to a parable; I will open my proposition on the psaltery.
48:6 Why shall I fear in the evil day? the iniquity of my heel shall encompass me.
48:7 They that trust in their own strength, and glory in the multitude of their riches,
48:8 No brother can redeem, nor shall man redeem: he shall not give to God his ransom,
48:9 Nor the price of the redemption of his soul: and shall labour for ever,
48:10 And shall still live unto the end.
48:11 He shall not see destruction, when he shall see the wise dying: the senseless and the fool shall perish together: And they shall leave their riches to strangers:
48:12 And their sepulchres shall be their houses for ever. Their dwelling places to all generations: they have called their lands by their names.
48:13 And man when he was in honour did not understand; he is compared to senseless beasts, and is become like to them.
48:14 This way of theirs is a stumblingblock to them: and afterwards they shall delight in their mouth.
48:15 They are laid in hell like sheep: death shall feed upon them. And the just shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their help shall decay in hell from their glory.
48:16 But God will redeem my soul from the hand of hell, when he shall receive me.
48:17 Be not thou afraid, when a man shall be made rich, and when the glory of his house shall be increased.
48:18 For when he shall die he shall take nothing away; nor shall his glory descend with him.
48:19 For in his lifetime his soul will be blessed: and he will praise thee when thou shalt do well to him.
48:20 He shall go in to the generations of his fathers: and he shall never see light.
48:21 Man when he was in honour did not understand: he hath been compared to senseless beasts, and made like to them.
