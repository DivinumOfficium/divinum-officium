19:1 (Unto the end. A psalm for David.)
19:2 May the Lord hear thee in the day of tribulation: may the name of the God of Jacob protect thee.
19:3 May he send thee help from the sanctuary: and defend thee out of Sion.
19:4 May he be mindful of all thy sacrifices: and may thy whole burnt offering be made fat.
19:5 May he give thee according to thy own heart; and confirm all thy counsels.
19:6 We will rejoice in thy salvation; and in the name of our God we shall be exalted.
19:7 The Lord fulfil all thy petitions: now have I known that the Lord hath saved his anointed. He will hear him from his holy heaven: the salvation of his right hand is in powers.
19:8 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will call upon the name of the Lord, our God.
19:9 They are bound, and have fallen: but we are risen, and are set upright. O Lord, save the king: and hear us in the day that we shall call upon thee.
