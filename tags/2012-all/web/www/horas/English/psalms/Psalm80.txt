80:1 (Unto the end, for the winepresses, a psalm for Asaph himself.)
80:2 Rejoice to God our helper: sing aloud to the God of Jacob.
80:3 Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel: the pleasant psaltery with the harp.
80:4 Blow up the trumpet on the new moon, on the noted day of your solemnity.
80:5 For it is a commandment in Israel, and a judgment to the God of Jacob.
80:6 He ordained it for a testimony in Joseph, when he came out of the land of Egypt: he heard a tongue which he knew not.
80:7 He removed his back from the burdens: his hands had served in baskets.
80:8 Thou calledst upon me in affliction, and I delivered thee: I heard thee in the secret place of tempest: I proved thee at the waters of contradiction.
80:9 Hear, O my people, and I will testify to thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken to me,
80:10 there shall be no new god in thee: neither shalt thou adore a strange god.
80:11 For I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.

80:13 So I let them go according to the desires of their heart: they shall walk in their own inventions.
80:14 If my people had heard me: if Israel had walked in my ways:
80:15 I should soon have humbled their enemies, and laid my hand on them that troubled them.
80:16 The enemies of the Lord have lied to him: and their time shall be for ever.
80:17 And he fed them with the fat of wheat, and filled them with honey out of the rock.
