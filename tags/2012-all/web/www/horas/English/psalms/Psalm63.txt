63:1 (Unto the end, a psalm for David.)
63:2 Hear O God, my prayer, when I make supplication to thee: deliver my soul from the fear of the enemy.
63:3 Thou hast protected me from the assembly of the malignant; from the multitude of the workers of iniquity.
63:4 For they have whetted their tongues like a sword; they have bent their bow a bitter thing,
63:5 To shoot in secret the undefiled.
63:6 They will shoot at him on a sudden, and will not fear: they are resolute in wickedness. They have talked of hiding snares; they have said: Who shall see them?
63:7 They have searched after iniquities: they have failed in their search. Man shall come to a deep heart:
63:8 And God shall be exalted. The arrows of children are their wounds:
63:9 And their tongues against them are made weak. All that saw them were troubled;
63:10 And every man was afraid. And they declared the works of God, and understood his doings.
63:11 The just shall rejoice in the Lord, and shall hope in him: and all the upright in heart shall be praised.
