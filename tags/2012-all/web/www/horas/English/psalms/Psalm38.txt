38:1 (Unto the end, for Idithun himself, a canticle of David.)
38:2 I said: I will take heed to my ways: that I sin not with my tongue. I have set a guard to my mouth, when the sinner stood against me.
38:3 I was dumb, and was humbled, and kept silence from good things: and my sorrow was renewed.
38:4 My heart grew hot within me: and in my meditation a fire shall flame out.
38:5 I spoke with my tongue: O Lord, make me know my end. And what is the number of my days: that I may know what is wanting to me.
38:6 Behold thou hast made my days measurable. and my substance is as nothing before thee. And indeed all things are vanity: every man living.
38:7 Surely man passeth as an image: yea, and he is disquieted in vain. He storeth up: and he knoweth not for whom he shall gather these things.
38:8 And now what is my hope? is it not the Lord? and my substance is with thee.
38:9 Deliver thou me from all my iniquities: thou hast made me a reproach to the fool.
38:10 I was dumb, and I opened not my mouth, because thou hast done it.
38:11 Remove thy scourges from me. The strength of thy hand hath made me faint in rebukes:
38:12 Thou hast corrected man for iniquity. And thou hast made his soul to waste away like a spider: surely in vain is any man disquieted.
38:13 Hear my prayer, O Lord, and my supplication: give ear to my tears. Be no silent: for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner as all my fathers were.
38:14 O forgive me, that I may be refreshed, before I go hence, and be no more.
