[Lectio93]
Prisca was a noble Roman maiden, who at thirteen years of age was accused of~
Christianity before the Emperor Claudius. By his command she was taken to the~
temple of Apollo to sacrifice there, and when she refused, was buffeted and sent~
to prison. She was taken out from thence again, but as she still held~
steadfastly to the faith, they flogged her, poured boiling tallow upon her, and~
sent her back a second time. She was at last thrown to a lion in the~
amphitheatre, but it quietly lay down at her feet. She was starved for three~
days in a slaves' prison house, and then tortured upon the rack. Pieces of flesh~
were next torn from her body with iron hooks, and she was thrown on a burning~
pile. She marvellously still remained alive, and was accordingly beheaded~
outside the city. Thus she added the crown of martyrdom to the palm of~
virginity. The Christians buried her body at the tenth milestone on the road~
from Rome to Ostia on the eighteenth of January.
