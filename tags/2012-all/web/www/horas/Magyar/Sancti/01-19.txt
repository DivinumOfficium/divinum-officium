[Lectio93]
!Commemoratio for St Maris, and his Companions, Martyrs.
Maris was a Persian of high rank, who came to Rome in the reign of the Emperor~
Claudius, with his wife Martha, who was equally noble, and their two sons~
Audifax and Abachum, to pray at the graves of the Martyrs. Here they comforted~
the Christians who were in prison, and whom they relieved by their ministrations~
and alms, and buried the bodies of the Saints. Fyor these acts they were all~
arrested, but no threats or terrors could move them to sacrifice to idols. They~
were accordingly mangled with clubs, and drawn with ropes, after which they were~
burnt by applying plates of red-hot metal to their bodies, and their flesh~
partly torn off with metal hooks. Lastly their hands were all cut off, and they~
were fastened together by the neck, in which state they were driven through the~
city to the thirteenth mile-stone on the Cornelian Way, a place now called Santa~
Ninfa, where they were to die. Martha addressed a moving exhortation to her~
husband and sons to hold out bravely to the last, for the love of Jesus Christ;~
and was then herself drowned. The other three martyrs were next beheaded in the~
same sand-pit. Their bodies were thrown into a fire. The lady Felicity of Rome~
collected the half-burnt remains, and caused them to be buried at her own farm.
