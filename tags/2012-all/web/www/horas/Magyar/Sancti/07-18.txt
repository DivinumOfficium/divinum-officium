[Oratio]
O God, Who, to succour the souls of the dying in their last agony, didst ennoble~
the holy Camillus with an extraordinary grace of charity, we beseech thee to~
pour into our hearts, for his sake, the Spirit of thy love, that we may worthily~
prevail against the enemy in the hour when we depart hence, and pass to receive a~
crown of glory in heaven.

[Lectio4]
Camillus was a son of the noble family of the Lelli, and was born at Bacchianico, a~
town in the Diocese of Chieti, (in the Abruzzi, in the year of our Lord 1550.)~
His mother was sixty years of age at the time of his birth. While she was great~
with child, she dreamed that she brought forth a babe bearing the mark of a~
Cross upon his breast, and going before a troop of other babes marked likewise.~
When Camillus was a young man he served as a soldier, and yielded himself for a~
while to the sins of the world. In the twenty-fifth year of his age light from~
God broke upon him and in a violent fit of tears he determined to wipe away~
the evil relics of his past life, and to put on the new man. That very day,~
being the holiday of the Purification of the most blessed Virgin, he ran to the~
Friars Minors, who are commonly called Capuchins, and implored them to enrol him~
among them. They granted his wishes, but God was keeping him for greater things,~
and on this as well as on another occasion when he made the same attempt he was~
forced to abandon it by the increasing virulence of a loathsome running sore in~
the leg, with which he was afflicted. He meekly bowed himself to the will of~
Providence, and conquering his own wishes twice, stripped himself of the habit~
of the Order, which he had sought and received.

[Lectio5]
He went to Rome and was received as an inmate in the Hospital for Incurables. In~
consequence of his eminent good qualities the administration of the Hospital was~
committed to his charge, and he discharged this office with the most thorough~
trustworthiness and with a tenderness like a father's. He counted himself the~
slave of all the patients, and made it a religious duty to make their beds,~
clean them, dress their sores, and help by godly prayers and exhortations such~
as were in their last agony. In doing these things he showed himself a bright~
example of wonderful patience, indomitable firmness, and heroic charity. He~
became persuaded that a knowledge of letters would make him much more useful as a~
comforter to the dying, who were his peculiar care, and therefore, at the age of~
thirty-two years, he humbly went to school again, among little boys learning the~
first rudiments. After a time he took Priests' orders, and, in company with~
some companions who joined him, he laid the first foundations of the~
Congregation of Regular Clerks for ministering to the sick a scheme against~
which the enemy of man made an unsuccessful struggle. Camillus heard a voice~
from heaven issue from an image of Christ Crucified, strengthening him, and saw~
the nailed hands stretched out from the Cross to protect him He obtained from~
the Apostolic see an approval of his Institute, the members of which, (besides~
the three vows of Poverty, Chastity, and Obedience,) take a fourth and very~
stern one, by which they bind themselves to serve all sick persons, even those~
stricken with the plague. Holy Philip Neri, who was Confessor to Camillus,~
testified that he had often seen Angels prompting the members of this~
Congregation what they should speak when they were assisting the dying, a proof~
how well-pleasing in the sight of God, and how useful for the salvation of souls,~
is this Institution.

[Lectio6]
Then he had thus given himself entirely over by these strict ties to the service~
of the sick, it was wonderful to see with what earnestness Camillus, broken by~
no weariness, and scared by no danger to himself, watched over their comfort by~
day and by night as long as life lasted. Becoming all things to all men, he took~
with cheerful readiness the most repulsive duties, discharging them with the~
most humble attention, and oftentimes on his knees, as though he saw Christ~
Himself in His suffering members. That he might be the readier to serve every~
onés need, he resigned the general government of his own Institute, and denied~
himself the indulgence in the heavenly refreshment which abundantly poured upon~
him, when he fixed his mind solely upon God. His tender, fatherly love toward~
the wretched had its brightest manifestations when Rome was stricken first by a~
contagious sickness, and then by famine, and Nola in Campagna suffered from a~
frightful plague. His love to God and to his neighbour was so glorious that he~
earned the nickname of Angel, and found Angels helping him in the difficulties~
of his divers journeyings. He had the gifts of prophecy and healing, and could~
read the secret thoughts of men's hearts. At his prayer, food was multiplied,~
and water turned into wine. His want of sleep, fasting, and unceasing work wore~
him down till he seemed nothing but skin and bones. He suffered from a~
complication of five different painful and incurable diseases, which he was~
accustomed to call the Lord's mercies to him, and which he bore bravely. He died~
at Rome on the day which he had himself foretold, the fourteenth of July, in the~
year of salvation 1614, and of his own age the 65th. He had received the~
Sacraments, and fell asleep in the Lord in an attempt to utter the sweet names~
of Jesus and Mary, while the Priest was reciting the words of the Ritual Gentle~
and joyous may the Countenance of Christ Jesus appear to thee. He was famous for~
many miracles, and Benedict XIV. solemnly enrolled him in the Kalendar of the~
Saints.

Evangélium Szt János Apostol könyvébõl
!John 15:12-16
Azon idõben így szót Jézus tanítványaihoz: Az az én parancsom, hogy szeressétek~
egymást, amint én szerettelek benneteket. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop of Hippo.
!83 th Tract on John.)
What think ye, my brethren Is this His only commandment, this, That we love~
one another Is there not another and a greater, the commandment to love God~
Or hath God commanded us only to love, so that we need seek to do no more~
Surely the Apostle commendeth three things: And now abideth Faith, Hope, Charity,~
these three but the greatest of these is Charity. (1 Cor. xiii. 13.) And~
although in charity, that is, in love, he included the two first and great~
commandments, and charity he called the greatest, yet is charity not said to be~
alone. Concerning Faith, concerning Hope, how much is commanded us Who can~
gather them all together Who can reckon them all And yet let us consider how~
the same Apostle saith Love is the fulfilling of the Law. (Rom. xiii. 10.)

[Lectio8]
Where therefore, Charity is, what can be lacking or where Charity is not, what~
can there be availing The devil believeth and loveth not, but there is no one~
that loveth and believeth not. Useless though it be, it is still possible for~
one that loveth not, to hope to be forgiven but for one that loveth it is~
impossible to give up hope. Therefore, where love is, there also must faith and~
hope needs be, and where there is love toward our neighbour there also must~
there needs be love toward God. For one that loveth not God, how can he love his~
neighbour as himself, seeing he hateth himself, for he is a blasphemous, wicked~
wretch, and the lover of wickedness is not the lover, but the deadly enemy of~
his own self.

!Commemoration for Ss. Symphorosa and seven sons Martyrs.
Symphorosa was a woman of Tivoli, the wife of the martyr Getulius, unto whom she~
bore seven sons, named respectively, Crescentius, Julian, Nemesius, Primitivus,~
Justin, Stacteus, and Eugene, all of whom were arrested along with their mother,~
in the reign of the Emperor Hadrian, for professing the Christian faith. Their~
love was tried by many and divers torments, and their mother who had taught them~
their religion, was their leader to martyrdom. A stone was tied round her neck~
and she was thrown into the river. Her body was found and buried by her brother~
Eugene. The next day, being the 18th of July, the seven brethren were tied each~
to a stake, and all put to death in divers ways. Crescentius was stabbed in the~
throat, Julian in the breast, Nemesius in the heart, and Primitivus in the~
navel. Justin was hacked limb from limb. Stacteus was shot to death with darts.~
Eugene was cut into two parts across his breast, (from the head downwards.) Thus~
were these eight sacrifices of sweet savour offered up to God. Their bodies were~
thrown into a deep pit, on the road between Rome and Tivoli, at the ninth~
milestone from Rome, but were afterwards brought to Rome and buried in the~
Church of the Holy Angel-in-the-Fish-market.

[Lectio9]
Hoc ergo praeceptum Domini teneamus, ut nos invicem diligamus, et quidquid ahud~
praecepit, faciemus: quoniam quidquid est aliud, hic habemus. Discernitur quippe~
ista dilectio ab illa dilectidne, qua se invicem diligunt homines: nam ut~
discerneretur, adjunctum est: Sicut dilexi vos. Ut quid enim diligit nos~
Christus, nisi ut regnare possimus cum Christo? Ad hoc ergo et nos invicem~
diligamus, ut dilectionem nostram discernamus a ceteris, qui non ad hoc se~
invicem dihgunt, quia nec diligunt. Qui autem se propter habendum Deum diligunt,~
ipsi se diligunt; ergo ut se diligant, Deum diligunt. Non est haec dilectio in~
omnibus hominibus: pauci se propterea diligunt, ut sit Deus omnia in omnibus.

[Lectio94]
Camillus, of the noble family of the Lelli, was born at Bucchianico in the diocese of Chieti. As a young man he entered the army and gave himself up for a time to worldly vices. But he was seized with sorrow at having offended God, and, going at once to the Friars Minor, called Capuchins, he earnestly pleaded to be admitted among them. His desire was granted this time, and again later on, when he had been out of the Order and had sought re-admission. But on both occasions an infected ulcer on his leg, which had afflicted him for some time, broke out, and he submitted himself humbly to his superiors, twice putting off the habit of the Order which he had twice asked for and received. He went to Rome and was ordained to the priesthood. Then he laid the first foundations of the Congregation of Clerks Regular for ministering to the sick, whose members bind themselves by a fourth and difficult vow to serve the sick even when they are infected by the plague. Worn out by repeated fasts and constant toil, and by five long and trying illnesses which he called the mercies of the Lord and bore with great fortitude, he died in the Lord on the 14th of July, 1614, at the age of sixty-five. Leo XIII proclaimed him the heavenly patron of all hospitals and of the sick, and ordered that his name be invoked in the litany for the dying.
