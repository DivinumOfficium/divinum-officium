Olvasmány szent Pál apostol Rómaiakhoz irott levelébõl
!Rom 13:1-4
1 Mindenki vesse alá magát a fölöttes hatalomnak. Mert nincs hatalom, csak az Istentõl, ami van, azt Isten rendelte. 
2 Ezért aki a hatósággal szembeszáll, Isten rendelésének szegül ellene. Az ellenszegülõ pedig magára vonja az ítéletet. 
3 A felsõbbség nem arra való, hogy a jótettõl ijesszen el, hanem a rossztól. Azt szeretnéd tehát, hogy ne kelljen a hatalomtól tartanod? Tedd a jót és megdicsér: 
4 Mert az Isten eszköze a javadra. De ha gonoszságot mûvelsz, rettegj, mert nem hiába viseli a kardot.

!Rom 13:4-7
4 Isten eszköze, hogy a gonosztevõt megbüntesse. 
5 Alá kell tehát magadat vetned neki, nemcsak a megtorlás miatt, hanem a lelkiismeret szerint is. 
6 Ezért fizettek adót is, hiszen akik behajtják, Isten szolgái. 
7 Adjátok meg mindenkinek, ami jár neki: akinek adó, annak az adót, akinek vám, annak a vámot, akinek hódolat, annak a hódolatot, akinek tisztelet, annak a tiszteletet. 

[Lectio3]
!Rom 12:8-10
8 aki a buzdítás ajándékát kapta, buzdítson, aki jótékonykodik, tegye egyszerûségben, aki elöljáró, legyen gondos, aki irgalmasságot gyakorol, tegye örömest. 
9 Szeressetek tettetés nélkül, irtózzatok a rossztól, ragaszkodjatok a jóhoz. 
10 A testvéri szeretetben legyetek gyöngédek egymáshoz, a tiszteletadásban elõzzétek meg egymást.

From the Sermons of Pope St Leo (the Great)
!1 st for Twelfth-Day.
Dearly beloved brethren, we have but lately celebrated that day whereon the~
inviolate virginity of Blessed Mary gave to man a Saviour. And now the venerable~
solemnity of the Epiphany giveth us a continuance of joy. So that by the~
nearness of these two holy Feasts, the freshness of our gladness and the~
quickening of our faith hath no time wherein to die away. And truly it~
concerneth the salvation of all men, that the Mediator between God and men is~
already made manifest before leaving the humble city of His birth.

[Lectio5]
It is true that the Lord chose the nation of Israel, and in that nation one~
family, whence to take upon Him that nature which He shareth with all mankind,~
but, at the same time, He would not that the narrow walls of His Mother's house~
should imprison within them all the brightness of His appearing, and, as He was~
pleased to be born for all, so willed He to be forthwith made manifest to all.~
Three wise men in the East, therefore, saw a new and brilliant star, which, by~
excelling all others in brightness and beauty, attracted the eyes and thoughts~
of all beholders and thereby it became at once evident that some new and great~
event had befallen.

[Lectio6]
Then He Who had given the sign, gave understanding to those that saw it; and~
having given to them to understand that He was born, He gave them the grace to~
seek Him; and, being sought by them, was pleased to be found. The three wise men~
followed the guiding of the heavenly light, and, with their eyes firmly fixed~
upon the glory that went before them, were so led by the light of grace as to~
obtain the knowledge of truth. They, knowing that He was born a King, sought Him~
in the Royal City; but He Who had taken upon Him the form of a servant, and came~
not to judge but to be judged, had chosen Bethlehem for His birth, and Jerusalem~
for His Suffering.

Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kõnyvébõl
!Matt 2:1-12
Amikor a júdeai Betlehemben Heródes király idejében Jézus megszületett, bölcsek jöttek napkeletrõl Jeruzsálembe és kérdezõsködtek: "Hol van a zsidók újszülött királya? És így tovább.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great.)
!10th on the Gospels.
The wise men teach us a great lesson in that they departed into their own~
country another way. That which they did, (being warned of God in a dream,) we~
ought to do. Our country is heaven; and, when we have once known Jesus, we can~
never get there by returning on the way wherein we walked before we knew Him. We~
have left our country far, by the way of pride, and disobedience, and~
worldliness, and forbidden indulgence we must seek that heavenly Fatherland by~
tears, by subjection, by contempt of the things which are seen, and by curbing~
the fleshly appetites.

[Lectio8]
Let us then depart into our own country another way. They that have by enjoyment~
put themselves away from it, must seek it again by sorrow. Therefore, my dearly~
beloved brethren, it behoveth us to be ever fearful and watch, having~
continually before the eyes of our heart, on the one hand, the guilt of our~
doings, and, on the other, the judgment at the latter day. It behoveth us to~
think how that awful Judge will surely come, Whose judgment is hanging over us,~
and hath not yet fallen the wrath to come is before sinners, and hath not yet~
smitten them and the Judge yet tarrieth in order that, when He cometh, there~
may haply be less to condemn.

[Lectio9]
Let us afflict ourselves for our faults with weeping, and, with the Psalmist,~
let us come before His Presence with thanksgiving. Let us take heed that we be~
not fooled by the appearance of earthly happiness, or seduced by the vanity of~
earthly pleasure. For the Judge is at hand, even He That saith Woe unto you~
that laugh now, for ye shall mourn and weep, (Luke vi. 25.) Hence also Solomon~
saith Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth is~
heaviness, (Prov. xiv. 13.) And again: I said of laughter, It is mad; and of~
mirth, What doeth it? (Eccles. ii. 2.) And yet again The heart of the wise is~
in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth, (vii.~
5.)

[Ant 2]
We have seen His star * in the East, and are come with gifts to worship the~
Lord.

[Ant 3]
Herod inquired * of the wise men What is the sign that ye have seen that a~
King is born? We have seen the shining of the star, the glory whereof~
enlighteneth the whole world.
