Olvasmány Sámuel elsõ könyvébõl
!1 Sam 5:1-5
1 A filiszteusok tehát zsákmányul ejtették az Isten ládáját, és Eben-ha-Ezerbõl Asdódba vitték. 
2 Ráadásul fogták a filiszteusok az Isten ládáját, aztán Dágon templomába vitték, és Dágon mellett állították fel. 
3 Amikor azonban Asdód lakói másnap fölkeltek és Dágon templomába mentek, lám, Dágon ott feküdt arccal a földön az Úr ládája elõtt. Fölemelték Dágont, és visszatették a helyére. 
4 Ám amikor a következõ nap korán fölkeltek, lám, Dágon újra ott feküdt arccal a föld felé fordulva az Úr ládája elõtt. Dágon feje és két keze ott volt levágva a küszöbön, csak a törzse maradt meg Dágonnak. 
5 Ezért Dágon papjai és akik Dágon templomát látogatják, mind a mai napig nem lépnek Asdódban Dágonnak a küszöbére.

!1 Sam 5:6-8
6 Az Úr keze súlyosan ránehezedett Asdód lakóira. Rémületbe estek, mert daganattal sújtotta õket, Asdódot és környékét. 
7 Amikor Asdód lakói látták, mi történt, kijelentették: "Izrael Istenének ládája nem maradhat tovább körünkben, mert keze súlyosan ránk és istenünkre, Dágonra nehezedett." 
8 Ezért mind összehívták a filiszteusok vezéreit, és megkérdezték tõlük: "Mit csináljunk Izrael Istenének ládájával?" Így határoztak: "Gátba kell vinni Izrael Istenének ládáját." Oda vitték hát Izrael Istenének ládáját.

!1 Sam 5:9-12
9 Amikor azonban elvitték oda, az Úr keze ránehezedett a városra, és nagyon nagy rémületet keltett. Lesújtott a városbeli férfiakra, apraja-nagyjára, úgyhogy daganatok keletkeztek rajtuk. 
10 Ekkor Ekronba küldték a ládát. Amikor Isten ládája Ekronba ért, Ekron lakói felkiáltottak: "Azért hozták ide Izrael Istenének ládáját, hogy egész népemmel együtt elpusztítsanak!" 
11 Aztán mind összehívták a filiszteusok vezéreit és így szóltak hozzájuk: "Vigyétek vissza Izrael Istenének ládáját a helyére, és ne pusztítsatok el engem s népemet." Mert nagy halálfélelem uralkodott az egész városban, annyira rájuk nehezedett az Úr keze. 
12 Azokon az embereken ugyanis, akik nem haltak meg, daganatok keletkeztek, és a város jajkiáltása az égig hatolt.

[Lectio4]
From the Sermons of St John Chrysostom Patriarch of Constantinople.
!Continuation of the both Homily.
In this mysterious Sacrament Christ doth mingle Himself with all and each of His~
faithful ones. They are His children, and He nurseth them Himself, and giveth~
them not over unto another, herein again assuring us that the Flesh He hath~
taken unto Himself is ours. We then, who have been deemed meet to be treated~
with such love and such honour, let us be wakeful See ye not how eagerly the~
sucklings seize on the breasts, how readily they fix their mouths on the paps~
Let us, with like eagerness, draw nigh to that Table, and suck at that spiritual~
Cup. Yea, let us prize that gracious Food as the suckling doth its mother's~
breast, and hold it the great woe of life to be cut off from that Banquet. Here~
there are set before us no works of man's power He That worked at that Last~
Supper, the Same worketh the same here still. As for us Priests, we hold the~
place of His ministers, but He Which halloweth and changeth is He. Hither let~
there draw nigh no Judas, nor covetous one this is no Table for him. But he~
which is Christ's disciple, let him come for the Lord saith "I will keep the~
Passover with My disciples," (Matth. xxvi. 18.) This is that Passover Table, and~
it is all Christ's what is wrought there is not some of it Christ's work, and~
some of it man's work, but it is all His work and not another's.

[Lectio5]
Wither let there draw nigh none brutal, none cruel, none merciless in good~
sooth, none unclean. I speak to all that take that Holy Communion, and to you~
also, O ye that do administer the same To you now I turn my speech, to warn~
you with how great care that Gift is to be given. No slight vengeance is that~
which awaiteth you if ye admit for a partaker at the Lord's Table the sinner~
whose guiltiness ye know. At your hands will his blood be required. If a man be a~
General, a Governor, a crowned Monarch, yet if he come there unworthily, forbid~
him thou hast greater power than he. To this end hath God exalted you to the~
honour ye hold, that ye may judge in such matters. This office is your dignity,~
this is your strength, this is all your crown, this, and not the going about in~
white robes and glittering vestments. And thou, O layman when thou seest the~
Priest making the oblation, think not that He Which is then the real Worker is~
such a Priest as thou seest, but know of a surety that it is Christ's Hand Which~
is stretched out, albeit unseen by thee.

[Lectio6]
Let us hear, all of us, both Priests and laymen, let us hear What Food it is~
whereof we are made worthy let us hear, I say, and let us quake. The Lord~
satisfieth us with His Own holy Flesh, setting Himself slain before us. What~
excuse therefore shall we have, if, being so fed as we are, we sin as we do If,~
eating of the Lamb, we are still wolves If, pastured as the sheep of the flock,~
we raven like lions This mysterious Sacrament forbiddeth unto us not outrage~
only, but any the least enmity it is the Mystery of peace. Upon the Jews God~
laid it to make year by year by solemn festivals a yearly commemoration of His~
mercies unto them, but upon thee to do this in remembrance of His love to thee,~
day by day. To this Table then let there draw nigh no Judas Iscariot, no Simon~
Magus. These men fell through covetousness let us fly that bottomless pit.

Evangélium szent János Apostol kõnyvébõl
!John 6:56-59 
At that time Jesus said unto the multitudes of the Jews My Flesh is meat indeed, and My Blood is drink indeed. And so on.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop of Hippo.
!26th Tract on John.
"This is the bread which cometh down from heaven," (v. 50.) By " this bread "the~
Lord here signifieth both the manna, and That Which we receive at the Altar of~
God. Both these are, as it were, Sacramental signs, differing indeed somewhat in~
their outward and visible part, but pointing to the Same Thing signified. Hear~
what the Apostle saith "Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be~
ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through~
the sea, and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea, and did~
all eat the same spiritual meat." (1 Cor. x. 1-3.) This meat was the same~
spiritually but not really they ate manna we eat Something else. Spiritually~
they ate What we eat but our fathers not their fathers; unto whom we are like~
not unto whom they are like. And it is added "And did all drink the same~
Spiritual drink." They drank one thing, and we drank Another, the difference~
being in the outer show, the sameness in that the Same Thing is pointed to by~
both. And what was that Same Drink? "They drank of the spiritual Rock that~
followed them, and that Rock was Christ." Him did bread and rock alike signify.~
The Rock was a figure, but by the Word and in the Flesh there is the very Christ~
Himself. And how came they to drink of that rock " Moses lift up his hand, and~
with his rod he smote the rock twice, and the water came out abundantly." (Num.~
xx. 11.) These two strokes of the rod upon the rock are a figure of the two~
beams whereof the Cross was made.

[Lectio8]
Christ's faithful ones discern the Lord's Body while they remain watchful~
members of His Body. They remain members of His Body as long as they will to~
live according to His Spirit. The Spirit of Christ giveth life to nothing but~
the body of Christ. Now, my brethren, understand what I am going to say. Thou~
art a man, and hast a body and a spirit. By spirit I mean the soul, which~
causeth thee to be a man at all. Thou art a man, made up of soul and body. thy~
spirit is unseen, thy body seen. Tell me, which of them is it which giveth~
animation to the other Doth thy spirit derive animation from thy body, or thy~
body from thy spirit Every one who liveth will answer for if any one~
cannot answer this, I know not if he be alive. What will whosoever hath life~
answer " Verily, it is my spirit which doth animate my body." Wilt thou then~
live by the Spirit of Christ Be of the Body of Christ.

[Lectio9]
Is it not my spirit which doth animate my body My spirit doth animate my body,~
and thy spirit doth animate thy body. The Body of Christ liveth not save by the~
Spirit of Christ. Hence it is that the Apostle Paul saith, touching this Bread "~
We, being many, are one bread, and one body, for we are all partakers of that~
one Bread." (1 Cor. x. 17.) O what a Sacrament of love O what a seal of union O~
what a bond of charity He that willeth to live hath here where to live, and~
whence to live. Let him come near, let him believe, let him enter into that Body,~
that he may be quickened. Let him not sever himself from the fit~
joining-together of all the members let him not be as a mortifying limb, that~
must needs be cut off, nor a mis-shapen limb, a cause to blush. Let him be~
goodly, and useful, and healthy. Let him cleave unto the body let him live by~
God to God let him labour now on earth, that he may reign hereafter in heaven.
