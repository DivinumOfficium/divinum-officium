[Oratio]
Almighty, eternal God, You Who in the abundance of Your love always grant more~
than Your humble petitioners deserve, and even more than they desire, pour forth~
Your mercy upon us that You may forgive whatever our conscience dreads, and give~
in addition what our prayer does not venture to ask.

[Lectio]
Lesson from the first letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians
!1 Cor. 15:1-10
Brethren: I recall to your minds the Gospel that I preached to you, which also you received, wherein also you stand, through which also you are being saved, if you hold it fast, as I preached it to you - unless you have believed to no purpose. For I delivered to you first of all, what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day, according to the Scriptures, and that He appeared to Cephas, and after that to the Eleven. Then He was seen by more than five hundred brethren at one time, many of whom are with us still, but some have fallen asleep. After that He was seen by James, then by the Apostles. And last of all, as by one born out of due time, He was seen also by me. For I am the least of the Apostles, and am not worthy to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God. But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace in me has not been fruitless.

[Graduale]
!Ps 27:7
In God my heart trusts, and I find help; then my heart exults, and with my song I~
give Him thanks.
V. To You, O Lord, I call; O my God, be not deaf to me; depart not from me.~
Alleluia, alleluia. 
!Ps 80:2-3
V. Sing joyfully to God our strength; acclaim the God of Jacob. Take up a~
pleasant psalm with the harp. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Mark
!Mark 7:31-37
At that time, Jesus departing from the district of Tyre came by way of Sidon to~
the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the district of Decapolis. And they~
brought to Him one deaf and dumb, and entreated Him to lay His hand upon him.~
And taking him aside from the crowd, He put His fingers into the man’s ears, and~
spitting, He sighed, and said to him, Ephpheta, that is, Be opened. And his ears~
were at once opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he began to~
speak correctly. And He charged them to tell no one. But the more He charged~
them, so much the more did they continue to publish it. And so much the more did~
they wonder, saying, He has done all things well. He has made both the deaf to~
hear and the dumb to speak.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 29:2-3
I will extol You, O Lord, for You drew me clear and did not let my enemies~
rejoice over me; O Lord, I cried out to You and You healed me.

[Secreta]
Look with mercy, we beseech You, O Lord, upon our act of worship that the gift~
we offer may be acceptable to You and may support us in our frailty.

[Communio]
!Prov 3:9-10
Honor the Lord with your wealth, with first fruits of all your produce. The will~
your barns be filled with grain, with new wine your vats will overflow.

[Postcommunio]
By receiving Your sacrament, O Lord, may we experience Your help in mind and~
body, that being cured in both, we may glory in the full effect of the heavenly~
remedy.
