Lesson from the first letter of St Paul the Apostle to Timotheus
!1 Tim. 5:3-10
Beloved: Honor widows who are truly widowed. But if a widow has children or grandchildren, let these first learn to provide for their own household and make some return to their parents, for this is pleasing to God. But she who is truly a widow, and left solitary, has set her hope on God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day. For she who gives herself up to pleasures is dead while she is still alive. And command them to be blameless. But if anyone does not take care of his own, and especially of his household, he has denied the Faith and is worse than an unbeliever. Let a widow who is selected be not less than sixty years old, having been married but once, with a reputation for her good works in bringing up children, in practicing hospitality, in washing the saints’ feet, in helping those in trouble, in carefully pursuing every good work.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 13:44-52
At that time, Jesus spoke this parable to His disciples: The kingdom of heaven~
is like a treasure hidden is a field; he who finds it hides it, and in his joy~
goes and sells all that he has and buys that field. Again, the kingdom of heaven~
is like a merchant in search of fine pearls. When he finds a single pearl of~
great price, he goes and sells all that he has and buys it. Again, the kingdom~
of heaven is like a net cast into the sea that gathered in fish of every kind.~
When it was filled, they hauled it out, and sitting down on the beach, they~
gathered the good fish into vessels, but threw away the bad. So will it be at~
the end of the world. The angels will go out and separate the wicked from among~
the just, and will cast them into the furnace of fire, where there will be the~
weeping, and the gnashing of teeth. Have you understood all these things? They~
said to Him, Yes. And He said to them, So then, every Scribe instructed in the~
kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings forth from his storeroom~
things new and old.

!Ps 44:3
Grace is poured out upon your lips; thus God has blessed you forever, and for~
ages of ages.

O Lord, may the offerings of Your devoted people be pleasing to You in honor of~
