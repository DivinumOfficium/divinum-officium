Lesson from the book of Judith
!Judith 13:22-25; 13:15; 13:10
The Lord has blessed you by His power, because by you He has brought our enemies to nought. Blessed are you, O daughter, by the Lord the Most High God, above all women upon the earth. Blessed be the Lord Who made heaven and earth, Who has directed you to the cutting off the head of the prince of our enemies, because He has so magnified your name this day, that your praise shall not depart out of the mouth of men, who shall be mindful of the power of the Lord forever; for you have not spared your life, by reason of the distress and tribulation of your people, but have prevented our ruin in the presence of our God. You are the glory of Jerusalem, you are the joy of Israel, you are the honor of our people.

[Graduale]
!Ps 44:11-12, 14.
Hear, O daughter, and see; turn your ear; for the King shall desire your beauty.
V. All glorious is the King’s daughter as she enters; her raiment is threaded~
with spun gold. Alleluia, alleluia.
V. Mary is taken up into heaven: the choirs of the angels rejoice. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 1:41-50
At that time, Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit, and cried out with a~
loud voice, saying, Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your~
womb! And how have I deserved that the Mother of my Lord should come to me? For~
behold, the moment that the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the babe in~
my womb leapt for joy. And blessed is she who has believed, because the things~
promised her by the Lord shall be accomplished. And Mary said, My soul magnifies~
the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; because He has regarded the~
lowliness of His handmaid; for, behold, henceforth all generations shall call me~
blessed; because He Who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is His~
name; and His mercy is from generation to generation on those who fear Him.

[Offertorium]
!Gen 3:15
I will put enmity between you and the Woman, between your seed and her seed.

[Secreta]
May the offering of our devotion rise unto You, O Lord, and by the intercession~
of the most blessed Virgin Mary, who was taken up into heaven, may our hearts,~
on fire with love, strive ever upward to You.

[Communio]
!Luke 1:48-49
All generations shall call me blessed; because He Who is mighty has done great~

[Postcommunio]
Having partaken, O Lord, of the sacrament of salvation, grant, we beseech You,~
that through the merits and intercession of the blessed Virgin Mary, who was~
taken up into heaven, we may be delivered from all the evils that threaten us.
