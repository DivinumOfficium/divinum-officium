[Oratio]
O God, whose right hand upheld blessed Peter, lest he should sink when walking~
on the waters, and did deliver blessed Paul, when shipwrecked for the third time,~
from the depth of the sea, hear us in thy mercy, and grant that, through the~
merits of both we may obtain the glory of the eternal life.

!Sir 44:10-15
v. But these were men of mercy, whose godly deeds have not failed: Good things continue with their seed, Their posterity are a holy inheritance, and their seed hath stood in the covenants. And their children for their sakes remain for ever: their seed and their glory shall not be forsaken. Their bodies are buried in peace, and their name liveth unto generation and generation. Let the people shew forth their wisdom, and the church declare their praise.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 14:22-33
v. And forthwith Jesus obliged his disciples to go up into the boat, and to go~
before him over the water, till he dismissed the people. And having dismissed~
the multitude, he went into a mountain alone to pray. And when it was evening,~
he was there alone. But the boat in the midst of the sea was tossed with the~
waves: for the wind was contrary. And in the fourth watch of the night, he came~
to them walking upon the sea. And they seeing him walk upon the sea, were~
troubled, saying: It is an apparition. And they cried out for fear. And~
immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying: Be of good heart: it is I, fear ye not.~
And Peter making answer, said: Lord, if it be thou, bid me come to thee upon the~
waters. And he said: Come. And Peter going down out of the boat, walked upon the~
water to come to Jesus. But seeing the wind strong, he was afraid: and when he~
began to sink, he cried out, saying: Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus~
stretching forth his hand took hold of him, and said to him: O thou of little~
faith, why didst thou doubt? And when they were come up into the boat, the wind~
ceased. And they that were in the boat came and adored him, saying: Indeed thou~
art the Son of God.
