v. De "aki dicsekszik, az Úrban dicsekedjék."  Nem az a megbízható, aki magát ajánlja, hanem akit az Úr ajánl.  Bárcsak eltûrnétek részemrõl egy kis balgaságot!  De hiszen meg is teszitek. Én Isten féltékenységével féltelek titeket. Mert eljegyeztelek benneteket egy férfival, hogy tiszta szûzként vezesselek el Krisztushoz.
