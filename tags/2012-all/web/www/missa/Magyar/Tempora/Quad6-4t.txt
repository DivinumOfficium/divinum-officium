v. But it behooves us to glory in the cross of Our Lord Jesus Christ: in Whom is our salvation, life, and resurrection; by whom we are saved and delivered.
!Ps. 66. 2
May God have mercy on us, and bless us: may He cause the light of His countenance to shine upon us; and may He have mercy on us.
v. But it behooves us to glory in the cross of Our Lord Jesus Christ: in Whom is our salvation, life, and resurrection; by whom we are saved and delivered.

[Oratio]
 O God, from whom Judas received the punishment of his guilt, and the thief the reward of his confession: grant unto us the full fruit of Thy clemency; that even as in His Passion, our Lord Jesus Christ gave to each a retribution according to his merits, so having taken away our old sins, He may bestow upon us the grace of His Resurrection. Who with Thee liveth and reigneth in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God, world without end.

Olvasmány szent Pál apostol Korintusiakhoz irott elsõ levelébõl
!1 Cor 11:20-32.
v. Amikor ugyanis egybegyûltök, már nem az Úr vacsoráját eszitek,  hiszen étkezéskor ki-ki a saját vacsoráját veszi elõ, hogy elfogyassza, s az egyik éhen marad, a másik pedig dõzsöl.  Nincs otthonotok evésre-ivásra? Vagy megvetitek Isten egyházát, és megszégyenítitek a szegényeket? Mit mondjak nektek? Dicsérjelek? Ezért nem dicsérlek benneteket.  Én ugyanis az Úrtól kaptam, amit közöltem is veletek: Urunk Jézus elárulásának éjszakáján fogta a kenyeret,  hálát adott, megtörte, és így szólt: "Vegyétek és egyétek, ez az én testem értetek. Ezt tegyétek az én emlékezetemre."  Ugyanígy vacsora után fogta a kelyhet, és így szólt: "Ez a kehely az új szövetség az én véremben. Ezt tegyétek, valahányszor isztok belõle, az én emlékezetemre."  Valahányszor ugyanis e kenyeret eszitek, és e kehelybõl isztok, az Úr halálát hirdetitek, amíg el nem jön.  Ezért aki méltatlanul eszi a kenyeret vagy issza az Úr kelyhét, az Úr teste és vére ellen vét.  Tehát vizsgálja meg magát mindenki, s csak úgy egyék a kenyérbõl és igyék a kehelybõl,  mert aki csak eszik és iszik anélkül, hogy megkülönböztetné az Úr testét, saját ítéletét eszi és issza.  Ezért sokan gyöngék és betegek közületek, többen pedig meghaltak.  Ha megítélnénk magunkat, nem vonnánk magunkra ítéletet.  Ha azonban az Úr ítél meg bennünket, az fenyítésünkre szolgál, hogy ezzel a világgal együtt el ne kárhozzunk. 

[Graduale]
!Phil 2:8-9
Christ became obedient for us unto death, even to the death of the cross. 
V. For which cause God also exalted Him and hath given Him a Name which is above all names.

[Evangelium]
Evangélium szent János Apostol kõnyvébõl
!Joann 13:1-15
v. Húsvét ünnepe elõtt történt: Jézus tudta, hogy elérkezett az óra, amikor a világból vissza kell térnie az Atyához, mivel szerette övéit, akik a világban maradtak, mindvégig szerette.  Vacsora közben történt, amikor a sátán már fölébresztette az áruló Júdásnak, Simon fiának szívében a gondolatot, hogy árulja el.  Jézus tudta, hogy az Atya mindent a kezébe adott, s hogy Istentõl jött és Istenhez tér vissza.  Mégis fölkelt a vacsora mellõl, levetette felsõruháját, fogott egy vászonkendõt, és maga elé kötötte.  Aztán vizet öntött egy mosdótálba, majd hozzáfogott, hogy sorra megmossa, s a derekára kötött kendõvel megtörölje tanítványainak a lábát.  Amikor Simon Péterhez ért, az tiltakozott: "Uram, te akarod megmosni az én lábamat?!"  Jézus így válaszolt: "Most még nem érted, amit teszek, de késõbb majd megérted."  Péter tovább tiltakozott: "Az én lábamat ugyan meg nem mosod soha!" "Ha nem moslak meg - felelte Jézus -, nem lehetsz közösségben velem."  Akkor, Uram, ne csak a lábamat, hanem a fejemet és a kezemet is!" - mondta Simon Péter.  De Jézus ezt felelte: "Aki megfürdött, annak csak a lábát kell megmosni, s akkor egészen tiszta lesz. Ti tiszták vagytok, de nem mindnyájan."  Tudta, hogy ki árulja el, azért mondta: "Nem vagytok mindnyájan tiszták."  Amikor megmosta lábukat, fölvette felsõruháját, újra asztalhoz ült és így szólt hozzájuk: "Tudjátok, mit tettem veletek?  Ti Mesternek és Úrnak hívtok, s jól teszitek, mert az vagyok.  Ha tehát én, az Úr és Mester megmostam lábatokat, nektek is meg kell mosnotok egymás lábát.  Példát adtam, hogy amit én tettem, ti is tegyétek meg.

[Post Missam]
!!Pange Lingua
v. Sing, my tongue, the Savior's glory:
Of His Flesh the mystery sing;
Of His Blood all price exceeding.
Shed by our immortal King.
Destined for the world's redemption
From a noble womb to spring. 
_  
v. Of a pure and spotless Virgin,
Born for us on earth below,
He, as Man with man conversing,
Stayed the seeds of truth to sow,
Then He closed in solemn order
Wondrously His life of woe. 	
_
On the night of His last supper,
Seated with His chosen band,
He, the paschal victim eating,
First fulfills the Law's command;
Then as food to all His brethren
Gives himself with His own hand. 	
_
v. Word made Flesh, the bread of nature,
By His words to Flesh He turns;
Wine into His Blood He changes:
What though sense no change discerns,
Only be the heart in earnest,
Faith her lesson quickly learns. 	
_
v. Down in adoration falling,
Lo, the Sacred Host we hail,
Lo, o'er ancient forms departing
Newer rites of grace prevail;
Faith for all defects supplying,
Where the feeble senses fail. 
_
v. To the everlasting Father
And the Son who reigns on high
With the Holy Ghost proceeding
Forth from each eternally,
Be salvation, honor, blessing,
Might and endless majesty.
Amen.

!Antiphone
!Ps 21:19
Ant. They parted my garments amongst them, and upon my vesture they cast lots.
v. My God, my God, look upon me: why hast Thou forsaken me? Far from my salvation are the words of my sins.
O my God, I shall cry by day and Thou wilt not hear: and by night, and it shall not be reputed as folly in me.
But Thou dwellest in holiness, O Thou Praise of Israel.
In Thee our fathers have hoped: they have hoped, and Thou hast delivered them.
They cried unto Thee, and were delivered: they trusted in Thee, and were not confounded.  	
But I am a worm and no man: a reproach of men, and the outcast of the people.
All they that saw me have laughed me to scorn: they have spoken with the lips, and wagged their head.
He trusted the Lord, let Him rescue him: let Him deliver him, seeing He delighteth in him. 
For Thou art He that hast drawn em out of the womb: my hope from the breasts of my mother. I was cast upon Thee from the womb.
From my mother's womb thou art my God: depart not from me.
For tribulation is very near; for there is none to help me.
Many calves have surrounded me: fat bulls have besieged me.  	
They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion.
I am poured out like water, and all my bones are scattered.
My heart is like melting wax in the midst of my bowels.
My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws: and Thou hast brought me into the dust of death.  	
For many dogs have compassed me: the council of the malignant have beseiged me.
They pierced my hands and my feet: they have told all my bones.  	
They look and stare upon me. They part my garments among them, and upon my vesture do they cast lots.
But Thou, O Lord, remove not Thy help to a distance from me: look towards my defense.
 O God, deliver my soul from the sword: my darling from the power of the dog!
 Save me from the lion's mouth: and my affliction from the horns of the unicorns.
 I will declare Thy Name unto my brethren: in the midst of the church will I praise Thee.
Ye that fear the Lord, praise Him: all ye seed of Jacob, glorify Him.
 Let all the seed of Israel fear Him. Because He hath not slighted nor despised the supplication of the poor man.  	
 Neither hath He hid His face from me: but when I cried unto Him, He heard me.
 With Thee is my praise in the great church: I will pay my vows in the sight of them that fear Him.  	
The poor shall eat and be filled, and they shall praise the Lord that seek Him: their hearts shall live for ever and ever.
All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto the Lord.  	
And all the kindreds of the Gentiles shall adore in His sight.  	
For the kingdom is the Lord's: and He shall have dominion over the nations.
 All the fat ones of the earth have eaten and have adored: all they that go down to the earth shall fall before Him.
 My soul also shall live unto Him: and my seed shall serve Him.
 The generation to come shall tell it unto the Lord: and the heavens shall declare His righteousness unto a people that shall be born, whom the Lord hath made.
Ant. They parted my garments amongst them, and upon my vesture they cast lots.
My God, my God, look upon me: why hast Thou forsaken me? Far from my salvation are the words of my sins.

!!Washing of the feet
!  At a convenient hour, after the unclothing of the altars, a signal is given with the clapper, and the clergy assemble for the Maundy or the Washing of the feet. The prelate or superior wears a purple stole and cope over his amice and alb, and with the deacon and subdeacon vested in white dalmatics, comes to the appointed place. The celebrant puts incense into the thurible, served by the deacon. Then the deacon, holding the Gospel book before his breast, kneels before the celebrant and asks a blessing; having received it, while two acolytes stand by with lighted candles, and the subdeacon holds the book, he makes the Sign of the Cross over teh book and incenses it and sings, in the usual way, the Gospel of the Mass: Before the festival-day, as above. After this the subdeacon takes the Gospel book open to the officiating priest to kiss, and the deacon incenses him as usual. Then the celebrant removes his cope, girds himself with a cloth, and assisted by his ministers, begins the washing of the feet of twelve clerks or twelve poor people chosen for the ceremony. While the subdeacon holds the right foot of each of those whose feet are to be washed, the celebrant, kneeling before him, washes the foot, wipes and kisses it, the deacon handing him a towel for the wiping. Meanwhile the following chants are sung by the choir.
