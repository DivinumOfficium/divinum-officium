Lesson from the book of Exodus
!Exod 23:20-23
Thus says the Lord God: See, I am sending My Angel before you, to guard you on the way and bring you to the place I have prepared. Be attentive to him and heed his voice. Do not rebel against him, for he will not forgive your sin. My authority resides in him. If you heed his voice and carry out all I tell you, I will be an enemy to your enemies and a foe to your foe, and My Angel will go before you.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 18:1-10
At that time, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the~
kingdom of heaven? And Jesus called a little child to Him, set him in their~
midst, and said, Amen I say to you, unless you turn and become like little~
children, you will not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whoever, therefore,~
humbles himself as this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of~
heaven. And whoever receives one such little child for My sake, receives Me. But~
whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to sin, it were better~
for him to have a great millstone hung around his neck, and to be drowned in the~
depths of the sea. Woe to the world because of scandals! For it must needs be~
that scandals come, but woe to the man through whom scandal does come! And if~
your hand or your foot is an occasion of sin to you, cut it off and cast it from~
you! It is better for you to enter life maimed or lame, than, having two hands~
or two feet, to be cast into the everlasting fire. And if your eye is an~
occasion of sin to you, pluck it out and cast it from you! It is better for you~
to enter into life with one eye, than, having two eyes, to be cast into~
hell-fire. See that you do not despise one of these little ones; for I tell you,~
their Angels in heaven always behold the face of My Father in heaven.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 102:20-21
Bless the Lord, all you His Angels, His ministers, who do His will, obeying His~
spoken word.

[Secreta]
Accept, O Lord, the gifts which we offer in honor of Your holy Angels, and~
mercifully grant that we may be freed from present perils by their perpetual~
protection and attain unto life everlasting.

[Communio]
!Dan 3:58
All you Angels of the Lord, bless the Lord: sing a hymn, and exalt Him above all~
forever.

[Postcommunio]
Rejoicing on the feast of Your holy Angels, O Lord, we have received the divine~
sacrament; we pray that we may ever be freed, by their protection, from the~
snares of the enemy and be preserved from all harm.
