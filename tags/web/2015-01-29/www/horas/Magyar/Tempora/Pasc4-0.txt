[Oratio]
O God, of Whom it cometh that the minds of thy faithful people be all of one~
will, grant unto the same thy people that they may love the thing which Thou~
commandest, and desire that which Thou dost promise, that so, amid the sundry~
and manifold changes of the world, our hearts may surely there be fixed, where~
true joys are to be found.

Olvasmány szent Jakab apostol leveléből
!Jas 1:1-6
1 Jakab, Istennek és Urunknak, Jézus Krisztusnak szolgája üdvözletet (küld) a~
szórványokban élő tizenkét törzsnek.
2 Testvéreim, tartsátok nagy örömnek, ha különféle megpróbáltatások érnek~
benneteket.
3 Tudjátok, hogy hitetek próbájának állhatatosság a gyümölcse.
4 Az állhatatosságnak meg tökéletességre kell vezetnie, hogy tökéletesek és~
feddhetetlenek legyetek, és semmilyen tekintetben ne essetek kifogás alá.
5 Ha valaki közületek bölcsességben szenved hiányt, kérje Istentől, aki szívesen~
ad mindenkinek, anélkül, hogy a szemére vetné,
6 s meg is kapja, csak hittel kérje, egy csöppet sem kételkedve. Mert aki~
kételkedik, hasonlít a tenger hullámaihoz, amelyeket felkorbácsol és ide-oda vet a~
szél.

[Responsory1]
R. If I forget thee, Alleluja, let my right hand forget me.
* If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth.~
Alleluja, Alleluja.
V. By the rivers of Babylon there we sat down and wept, when we remembered thee, O~
Zion
R. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth.~
Alleluja, Alleluja.

[Lectio2]
!Jas 1:6-11
6 s meg is kapja, csak hittel kérje, egy csöppet sem kételkedve. Mert aki~
kételkedik, hasonlít a tenger hullámaihoz, amelyeket felkorbácsol és ide-oda vet a~
szél.
7 Az ilyen ember ne higgye, hogy bármit is kap az Úrtól,
8 hiszen a lelkében megosztott ember nem tart ki semmiben sem.
9 Az alacsony rangú testvér viszont dicsekedjék felmagasztalásával,
10 a gazdag meg megalázkodásával, mert mint a rét virága, semmivé lesz.
11 Ha a nap fölkel, perzselő heve kiégeti a növényt, virága lehull, szépsége~
elenyészik. Így lesz semmivé a gazdag is a vállalkozásaival.

[Responsory2]
R. The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee and they were afraid.
* There was a noise as of many waters the clouds sent out a sound. Alleluja,~
Alleluja, Alleluja.
V. thy lightnings lightened the world the earth saw it and shook.
R. There was a noise as of many waters the clouds sent out a sound. Alleluja,~
Alleluja, Alleluja.

[Lectio3]
!Jas 1:12-16
12 Boldog az az ember, aki a kísértésben helytáll, mert miután kiállja a próbát,~
megkapja az élet koszorúját, amelyet az Úr azoknak ígért, akik őt szeretik.
13 Senki se mondja, aki kísértést szenved: "Az Isten kísért", mert az Istent nem~
lehet rosszra csábítani, és ő sem csábít rosszra senkit.
14 Minden embert a saját kívánsága vonzza és csábítja, így esik tőrbe.
15 Aztán a kívánság, ha már megfogant, bűnt szül, a bűn meg, ha elkövetik,~
halált szül.
16 Ne legyetek hát tévedésben, szeretett testvéreim.

[Responsory3]
R. I will declare thy Name unto my brethren Alleluja.
* In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee Alleluja, Alleluja.
V. I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people, and sing unto thee among the~
nations.
R. In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee Alleluja, Alleluja.
&Gloria
R. In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee Alleluja, Alleluja.

[Lectio4]
From the exposition of S. Cypriani bishop and Martyr on the good patience.
!Sermone 3. initio.
Dearly beloved brethren, I am about to speak to you touching patience, and to~
preach to you how useful and convenient a thing it is and how shall I begin~
better, than by saying that you will have need oi patience to listen to me, yea,~
your very hearing and learning" cannot but corruption." be an exercise thereof?~
It is when a sermon or soul-profiting argument is given ear to patiently that it~
teacheth profitably. Dearly beloved brethren, there are divers paths of heavenly~
wisdom, wherein we are invited to walk, if we would reach in the end the reward~
which God hath prepared to crown hope and faith but I find no path more useful~
to life - ward, nor more sure to glory -ward than this, that while we humbly~
strive, in all fear, and in all godliness, to obey the commandments of the Lord,~
we should set our chiefest guard in an unceasing watch over our patience. The~
philosophers also say that they take this path, but their patience is as much a~
sham as their wisdom is a cheat, for who can be wise or patient who knoweth~
nothing of God's wisdom or God's patience are the lives of servers and~
worshippers of God. Let it be ours, then, to show forth by spiritual~
watchfulness that patience which is a part of the teaching which we have learnt~
from heaven. Patience is one of His Own virtues whereof God hath made us~
partakers with Him our Great Head is the Captain of the patient, and it is~
through patience that He hath crowned Himself with glory and honour. Yea, God is~
Himself the Source, the Fountain, and the Greatness of patience, and it behoveth~
man to love what is beloved of God. That good thing which he loveth is commended~
unto him of God's Majesty. If God be our Lord and Father, let us follow after~
the ensample of our Lord and Father's patience, since it is the duty of servants~
to be obedient, and of sons to be home-minded.

[Responsory4]
R. Bless ye God in the congregations Alleluja.
* Even the Lord, ye that are of the fountains of Israel Alleluja, Alleluja.
V. Sing forth the honour of His Name, make His praise glorious.
R. Even the Lord, ye that are of the fountains of Israel Alleluja, Alleluja.

[Lectio5]
But as for us, dearly beloved brethren, we are the real philosophers, whose~
wisdom lieth not in words but in deeds, and is manifested not in dresses but in~
the truth. We are they whose knowledge hath the inward consciousness, not the~
idle boasting, of strength. We are not speakers of high-sounding words, but our~
lives are the lives of servers and worshippers of God. Let it be ours, then, to~
show forth by spiritual watchfulness that patience which is a part of the~
teaching which we have learnt from heaven. Patience is one of His Own virtues~
whereof God hath made us partakers with Him : our Great Head is the Captain of~
the patient, and it is through patience that He hath crowned Himself with glory~
and honour. Yea, God is Himself the Source, the Fountain, and the Greatness of~
patience, and it behoveth man to love what is beloved of God. That good thing~
which he loveth is commended unto him of God's Majesty. If God be our Lord and~
Father, let us follow after the ensample of our Lord and Father's patience,~
since it is the duty of servants to be obedient, and of sons to be home-minded.

[Responsory5]
R. With my whole heart Alleluja have I sought thee Alleluja.
* O let me not wander from thy commandments Alleluja, Alleluja.
V. Blessed art Thou, O Lord teach me thy statutes.
R. O let me not wander from thy commandments Alleluja, Alleluja.

[Lectio6]
By our patience God draweth us toward Himself, and keepeth us His Own. Patience~
doth soothe anger, bridle the tongue, govern the mind, keep peace, set rules of~
self-control, break the onset of lust, still the swelling of temper, put out the~
fire begotten of hatred, make the rich meek, and relieve the need of the poor~
patience doth guard in virgins their blessed wholeness in widows, their careful~
purity in such as be married, their single-hearted love one toward the other.~
Patience doth teach such as be successful to be lowly-minded such as be~
unfortunate, to be brave and all to be gentle when they are wronged and~
insulted. Patience maketh a man soon to forgive them that trespass against him,~
and if he have trespassed against any, long and humbly to ask his pardon.~
Patience doth fight down temptations, bear persecution, and endure unto the end~
in suffering, and in uplifting of our testimony. Patience is the moat that~
guardeth the stout foundations of the castle of our faith. The Lord Jesus told~
His disciples what things they should suffer after that He was gone away from~
them, and then He said: "These things I said not unto you at the beginning,~
because I was with you but now I go My way to Him That sent Me." Let us first~
see whether it had been that He had not told them before this what they were to~
suffer in time coming. That He had done so amply before the night of the last~
Supper, is testified by the three first Evangelists, but it was when that Supper~
was ended that, according to John, He said " These things I said not unto you at~
the beginning, because I was with you."

[Responsory6]
R. Sing us a song Alleluja.
* How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land Alleluja, Alleluja.
V. There they that carried us away captive required of us a song.
R. How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land Alleluja, Alleluja.
&Gloria
R. How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land Alleluja, Alleluja.

Evangélium szent János Apostol kőnyvéből
!John 16:5-14
Azon időben mondá Jézus tanítványainak: Most elmegyek ahhoz, aki küldött. De~
senki sem kérdezi közületek: Hova mégy? És így tovább.

Homily by St Austin, Bishop of Hippo.

The Lord Jesus told His disciples what things they should suffer after that He~
was gone away from them, and then He said: "These things I said not unto you at~
the beginning, because I was with you ; but now I go My way to Him That sent~
Me." Let us first see whether it had been that He had not told them before this~
what they were to suffer in time coming. That He had done so amply before the~
night of the last Supper, is testified by the three first Evangelists, but it~
was when that Supper was ended that, according to John, He said : " These things I~
said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you."

[Responsory7]
R. I will sing a new song unto thee, O God Alleluja.
* Upon a psaltery of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee. Alleluja,~
Alleluja.
V. Thou art my God, and I will praise thee Thou art my God, and I will exalt~
thee.
R. Upon a psaltery of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee. Alleluja,~
Alleluja.

[Lectio8]
Are we then to try and loose the knot of this difficulty by asserting that,~
according to these three Evangelists, it was on the eve of the Passion, albeit~
before the Supper, that He had said these things unto them, and therefore not at~
the beginning, when He was with them, but when He was about to leave them, and~
go His way to the Father And in this way we might reconcile the truthfulness of~
what this Evangelist saith here "These things I said not unto you at the~
beginning" with the truthfulness of the! other three. But this explanation is~
rendered impossible by the Gospel according to Matthew, who telleth us how that~
the Lord spake to His Apostles concerning their sufferings to come, not only~
when He was on the point of eating the Passover with them, but at the very~
beginning, when the names of the twelve are first given, and they were sent~
forth to do the work of God. (Matth. x. 17-42.)

[Responsory8]
R. It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord Alleluja
* And to sing praises Alleluja.
V. Upon an instrument of ten strings, upon the harp with a solemn sound.
R. And to sing praises Alleluja.
&Gloria
R. And to sing praises Alleluja.

[Lectio9]
It would seem then that when He said: "These things I said not unto you at the~
beginning, because I was with you," He meant by " these things," not the~
sufferings which they were to bear for His sake, but His promise of the~
Comforter Who should come to them, and testify while they suffered, (xv. 26,~
27.) This Comforter then, or Advocate, (for the Greek word " Parakletos " will~
bear either interpretation,) would be needful to them when they saw Christ no~
more, and therefore it was that Christ spoke not of Him " at the beginning " (of~
the Gospel Dispensation) while He Himself " was with " His disciples, because~
His visible Presence was then their sufficient Comfort.
