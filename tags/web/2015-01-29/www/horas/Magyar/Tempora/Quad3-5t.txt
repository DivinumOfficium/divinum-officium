Evangélium szent János Apostol kőnyvéből
!John 4:5-42
Azon időben odaért Szamaria egyik városához, Szikarhoz, ez annak a földnek a közelében volt, amelyet Jákob fiának, Józsefnek adott. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!15th Tract on John.
Jesus, wearied with His journey, Jesus, wearied with His journey, the mysteries~
are beginning now. It is not for nothing that Jesus is wearied. It is not for~
nothing that the Mighty One of God is wearied. It is not for nothing that He is~
wearied Who Himself giveth Rest to all them that are weary and heavy-laden. It~
is not for nothing that He is wearied Whose absence prostrateth us, and Whose~
presence maketh us to be strong.

Jesus, therefore, being wearied with His journey, sat thus on the well and it~
was about the sixth hour. There is a depth in all these details they all have~
something to say for us to learn. Upon them we gaze. Knock, saith the Lord, and~
it shall be opened unto you. Let us knock then and, O, may He open to me and to~
you, even He Who hath spoken to us those words Knock, and it shall be opened~
unto you. (Matth. vii. 7.) It is for thy sake that Jesus was wearied with His~
journey. We find the strength of Jesus, and we find Jesus weak; yea, strong and~
weak. Strong, for In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and~
the Word was God the Same was in the beginning with God. Wouldest thou know~
again how that the Son of God is strong? All things were made by Him, and~
without Him was not anything made that was made made without effort. (John i.~
1-3.) What then is stronger than He by Whom all things were made without effort?~
Wouldest thou know His weakness? The Word was made Flesh and dwelt among us.~
~(14O Christ, strong, made thee; Christ, weak, redeemed thee. Christ, strong,~
made all things out of nothing; Christ, weak, so wrought that that that was made~
perished not. His strength hath made us, and His weakness saved us.

[Lectio3]
He then, being Himself made weak, is strength to all such as are weak, gathering~
them together, to use His own figure, even as an hen gathereth her chickens~
under her wings. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem! how often would I have gathered thy~
children together, even as an hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye~
would not! (Matth. xxiii. 37.) Consider now, my brethren, in what bondage is an~
hen to her chickens. There is no other bird in whom motherhood is unmistakeable.~
We watch the sparrows building their nests under our eyes; we see swallows, and~
storks, and pigeons building theirs every day. But, unless we actually see them~
in their nests, we know not if they have little ones, or no. But the hen's~
motherhood is so much a part of herself, that even if at the minute we see not~
her children the chickens following after her, nevertheless we see by her ways~
if she be a mother.
