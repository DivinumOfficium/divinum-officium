$Deo gratias

[Hymnus Vespera]
v. Lo, how the savage crew
Of our proud sins hath rent
The heart of our all-gracious God,
That heart so innocent.
_
The soldier's quivering lance
Our guilt it was that drave,
Our wicked deeds that to its point
Such cruel sharpness gave.
_
O wounded heart, whence sprang
The Church, the Saviour's bride;
Thou door of our salvation's ark
Set in its mystic side.
_
Thou holy fount, whence flows
The sacred sevenfold flood,
Where we our filthy robes may cleanse
In the Lamb's saving blood:
_
By sorrowful relapse,
thee will we rend no more;
But like the flames, those types of love,
Strive heavenward to soar.
_
Father and Son supreme
And Spirit, hear our cry;
Whose is the kingdom, praise and power,
Through all eternity.
Amen.

The Sacred Heart of Jesus, which was wounded for love of us, * O come, let us worship.

[Hymnus Matutinum]
v. O Christ, the world's Creator bright,
Who didst mankind from sin redeem,
Light from the Father's glorious light,
True God of God, in bliss supreme.
_
thy love compelled thee to assume
A mortal body, man to save;
Reversing the old Adam's doom;
Our ransom the new Adam gave.
_
That love which gloriously framed all
The earth, the stars, and wondrous sea
Took pity on our parents' fall,
Broke all our bonds and set us free.
_
O Saviour, let thy potent love
Flow ever from thy bounteous heart;
To nations that pure fount above
The grace of pardon will impart.
_
His heart for this was opened wide,
And wounded by the soldier's spear,
That freely from his sacred side
Might flow the streams our souls to clear.
_
Glory to Father and to Son,
And to the Holy Ghost the same,
To whom all power, when time is done,
And endless rule, in endless fame.
Amen.

Olvasmány Jeremiás próféta könyvéből
!Jer 24:5-7
5 Ezt mondja az Úr, Izrael Istene: Amint jó ez a füge, ugyanolyan jóakarattal törődöm majd Júda száműzötteivel, akiket elküldtem erről a helyről a káldeusok földjére.
6 Feléjük fordítom tekintetem, hogy jót tegyek velük, és visszahozom őket ebbe az országba. Mert fölépíteni akarom őket, nem lerombolni; elültetni őket, nem kigyomlálni.
7 És szívet adok nekik, hogy elismerjék: én vagyok az Úr. Ok az én népem lesznek, én meg Istenük leszek, mert teljes szívükből hozzám térnek.

[Responsory1]
R. Fériam eis pactum sempitérnum et non désinam eis benefácere et timórem meum dabo in corde eórum
* Ut non recédant a me.
V. Et lćtábor super eis cum bene eis fécero in toto Corde meo.
R. Ut non recédant a me.

!Jer Jer 30:18-19; 30:21-24
18 Ezt mondja az Úr: Helyreállítom Jákob sátrait, és megkönyörülök hajlékain. Újraépítik romjaiból a várost, és a palotát is a maga helyén.
19 Hálaadás hallatszik onnan és örömnek szava. 
21 Vezérük közülük származik, és fejedelmük a maguk köréből. Színem elé engedem, úgyhogy elém járulhat. Mert ki merné életét kockáztatni, hogy elém járuljon? mondja az Úr.
22 Így ti az én népem lesztek, én meg a ti Istenetek leszek.
23 De megindul az Úr haragjának fergetege is, és pusztító vihar zúdul a gonoszok fejére.
24 Az Úr fölgerjedt haragja nem csillapul le, míg csak végbe nem viszi és meg nem valósítja szívének szándékait; az idők végén értitek ezt meg.

[Responsory2]

2 Ezt mondja az Úr: Kegyelmet talált a pusztában a kardtól megmenekült nép: Izrael nyugalma felé tart.
3 Megjelent neki a távolból az Úr: örök szeretettel szerettelek, azért megő riztem irántad irgalmasságomat.
31 Igen, jönnek napok - mondja az Úr -, amikor új szövetséget kötök Izrael házával és Júda házával.
32 De nem olyan szövetséget, mint amilyet atyáikkal kötöttem azon a napon, amikor kézen fogva kivezettem őket Egyiptom földjéről. Azt a szövetségemet ugyanis megszegték, holott én uruk voltam - mondja az Úr.
33 Ez lesz az a szövetség, amelyet majd Izrael házával kötök, ha elérkeznek azok a napok - mondja az Úr: Bensejükbe adom törvényemet, és a szívükbe írom. Én Istenük leszek, ők meg az én népem lesznek.

[Lectio4]
!From the Encyclical Letter of Pope Pius XI
Among the wonderful developments of sacred teaching and piety, by which the plans of the divine Wisdom are daily made clear to the Church, hardly any is more manifest than the triumphant progress made by the devotion of the most Sacred Heart of Jesus. Very often indeed, during the course of past ages, Fathers, Doctors, and Saints have celebrated our Redeemer's love : and they have said, that the wound opened in the side of Christ was the hidden fountain of all graces. Moreover, from the Middle Ages onward, when the faithful began to shew a more tender piety towards the most sacred Humanity of the Saviour, contemplative souls became accustomed to penetrate through that wound almost to the very Heart itself, wounded for the love of men. And from that time, this form of contemplation became so familiar to all persons of saintly life, that there was no country or religious order in which, during this period, witnesses to it were not to be found. Finally, during recent centuries, and most especially at that period when heretics, in the name of a false piety, strove to discourage Christians from receiving the most Holy Eucharist, the veneration of the most Sacred Heart began to be openly practised, principally through the exertions of St. John Eudes, who is by no means unworthily called the founder of the liturgical worship of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary.

[Responsory4]
R. The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him,
* Yea, unto all such as call upon him faithfully.
V. The Lord is full of compassion and mercy, long-suffering and of great goodness.
R. Yea, unto all such as call upon him faithfully.

[Lectio5]
But in order to establish fully and entirely the worship of the most Sacred Heart of Jesus, and to spread the same throughout the whole world, God himself chose as his instrument a most humble virgin from the order of the Visitation, St. Margaret Mary Alacoque, who even in her earliest years already had a burning love for the Sacrament of the Eucharist, and to whom Christ the Lord had very many times appeared, and was pleased to make known the riches and the desires of his divine Heart. The most famous of these apparitions was that in which Jesus revealed himself to her in prayer before the blessed Sacrament, shewed her his most Sacred Heart, and, complaining that in return for his unbounded love, he met with nothing but outrages and ingratitude from mankind, he ordered her to concern herself with the establishment of a new feast, on the Friday after the Octave of Corpus Christi, on which his Heart should be venerated with due honour, and that the insults offered him by sinners in the Sacrament of love should be expiated by worthy satisfaction. But there is no one who knoweth not how many and how great were the obstacles which the handmaid of God experienced, in carrying out the commands of Christ ; but, endowed with strength by the Lord himself, and actively aided by her pious spiritual directors, who exerted themselves with an almost unbelievable zeal, up to the time of her death she never ceased faithfully to carry out the duty entrusted to her by heaven.

[Responsory5]
R. I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent ;
* Yea, thou hast revealed them unto babes.
V. Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.
R. Yea, thou hast revealed them unto babes.

[Lectio6]
At length, in the year 1765, the Supreme Pontiff Clement XIII approved the Mass and Office in honour of the most Sacred Heart of Jesus ; and Pius IX extended the feast to the universal Church. From then on the worship of the most Sacred Heart, like an overflowing river, washing away all obstacles, hath poured itself forth over all the earth, and, at the dawn of the new century, Leo XIII, having proclaimed a jubilee, decided to dedicate the whole human race to the most Sacred Heart. This consecration was actually carried out with solemn rites in all the churches of the Catholic world, and brought about a great increase of this devotion, leading not only nations but even private families to it, who in countless numbers dedicated themselves to the Divine Heart, and submitted themselves to its royal sway. Lastly, the Sovereign Pontiff Pius XI, in order that, by its solemnity, the feast might answer more fully to the greatly widespread devotion of the Christian people, raised the feast of the most Sacred Heart of Jesus to the rite of a double of the first class, with an octave ; and moreover, that the violated rights of Christ, the supreme King and most loving Lord, might be repaired, and that the sins of the nations might be bewailed, he ordered that annually, on that same feast-day, there should be recited an expiatory form of prayer in all the churches of the Christian world.

[Responsory6]
R. All nations whom thou hast made shall come
* And they shall worship thee, O Lord.
V. Yea, they shall glorify thy Name, for thou art great, and doest wondrous things.
R. And they shall worship thee, O Lord.
&Gloria
R. And they shall worship thee, O Lord.

Evangélium szent János Apostol kőnyvéből
!John 19:31-37
At that time : The Jews, because it was the Preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the Sabbath Day, for that Sabbath Day was an high day, besought Pilate that their legs might broken, and that they might be taken away. And so on,
_
A Homily by St. Bonaventure the Bishop
!Liber de ligno vitć, num. 30
In order that the Church might be taken out of the side of Christ, in his deep sleep on the Cross, and that the Scripture might be fulfilled which saith : They shall look on him whom they pierced : it was divinely ordained that one of the soldiers should pierce his sacred side with a spear, and open it. Then forthwith there came flowing out blood and water, which was the price of our salvation, pouring forth from its mountain-source, in sooth, from the secret places of his Heart, to give power to the Sacraments of the Church, to bestow the life of grace, and to be as a saving drink of living waters, flowing up to life eternal for those who were already quickened in Christ. Arise, then, O soul beloved of Christ. Cease not thy vigilance, place there thy lips, and drink the waters from the fount of salvation.

[Responsory7]
R. If I be lifted up,
* I will draw all men unto me.
V. This he said, signifying what death he should die.

!De vite mystica Cap. 3
Because we are now come to the sweet Heart of Jesus, and because it is good for us to be here, let us not too soon turn away therefrom. O how good and joyful a thing it is to dwell in this Heart. What a good treasure, what a precious pearl, is thy Heart, O most excellent Jesu, which we have found hidden in the pit which hath been dug in this field, namely, in thy body. Who would cast away such a pearl? Nay, rather, for this same I would give all my pearls. I will sell all my thoughts and affections, and buy the same for myself, turning all my thoughts to the Heart of the good Jesus, and without fail it will support me. Therefore, o most sweet Jesu, finding this Heart that is thine and mine, I will pray to thee, my God : admit my prayers into the shrine of hearkening : and draw me even more altogether into thy Heart.

[Responsory8]
R. Be ye therefore followers of God ;
* And walk ye therefore in love.
V. For Christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for us.
R. And walk ye therefore in love.
&Gloria
R. And walk ye therefore in love.

[Lectio9]
For to this end was thy side pierced, that an entry might be open unto us. To this end was thy Heart wounded, that in it we might be able to dwell secure from alarms from without. And it was wounded none the less on this account that, because of the visible wound, we may perceive the wound of love which is invisible. How could this fire of love better shine forth than for him to permit that not only his body, but that even his Heart, should be wounded with the spear? Who would not love that Heart so wounded? Who would not, in return, love one who is so loving? Who would not embrace one so chaste? Wherefore let us who are in the flesh love in return, as much as we can, him who so loveth, embrace our wounded one, whose hands and feet, side and Heart, have been pierced by wicked husbandmen ; and let us pray that he may deign to bind our hearts, still hard and impenitent, with the chain of his love, and wound them with the dart thereof.

[Hymnus Laudes]
v. Jesus, behind thy temple's veil,
Hid in an ark of gold,
On stones engraven, lay the law
thy finger wrote of old.
_
But in thy body's temple new,
thy life-blood's throbbing shrine,
Held, upon fleshly tables graved,
The law of love divine.
_
And when that heart in death was stilled,
Each temple's veil was riven:
And lo, within thy love's red shrine,
To us to look was given.
_
There make us gaze and see the love
Which drew thee, for our sake,
O great high-priest, thyself to God
A sacrifice to make.
_
Thou, Saviour, cause that every soul
Which thou hast loved so well,
May will within thine open heart
In life and death to dwell.
_
Grant it, O Father, only Son,
And Spirit, God of grace,
To whom all worship shall be done,
In every time and place.
