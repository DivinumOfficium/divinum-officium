Evangélium szent Máté könyvéből
!Matt 8:5-13
Azon időben Jézus beért Kafarnaumba, egy százados járult eléje, kérve őt: "Uram - szólította meg -, szolgám bénán fekszik otthon, és rettenetesen kínlódik." És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!Book ii. on the Agreement of the Evangelists, ch. xx. torn. 4.
Let us consider whether Matthew and Luke are at one as touching this centurion's~
servant. Matthew saith There came unto Him a centurion, beseeching Him, and~
saying Lord, my servant lieth at home sick, of the palsy. This seemeth to~
differ from what Luke saith namely And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto~
Him the elders of the Jews, beseeching Him that He would come and heal his~
servant. And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying That~
he was worthy for whom He should do this; for he loveth our nation, and he hath~
built us a synagogue. Then Jesus went with them; and when He was now not far~
from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying unto Him: Lord,~
trouble not thyself; for I am not worthy that Thou shouldest enter under my~
roof. (vii. 6, et seq.)
