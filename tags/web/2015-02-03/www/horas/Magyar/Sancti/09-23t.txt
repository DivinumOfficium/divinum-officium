[Lectio4]
POPE Linus was by birth a native of Velletri in Tuscany, and was~ 
the first after Peter who governed the Church. His faith and holiness~
were such that he not only cast out devils, but also raised the dead. He wrote~
the acts of Blessed Peter, and especially the history of his strife with Simon~
Magus. He forbade women to enter the Church without having a veil upon their~
heads. His own head was cut off, on account of his firmness in confessing Christ,~
by command of the godless Consular Saturninus, an unthankful wretch whose own~
daughter he had delivered from being tormented by a devil. He was buried upon~
the Vatican Mount, hard by the grave of the Prince of the Apostles, upon the~
23rd day of September. He sat as Pope eleven years, two months, and twenty -~
three days. He held two December ordinations, wherein he made fifteen Bishops,~
and eighteen Priests.

From the Exposition of the hundred -and - eighteenth Psalm by St Ambrose, Bishop~
~(of Milan)
!1st Sermon
Princes have persecuted me without a cause; but my heart standeth in awe of thy~
word. These are rightly the words of a martyr, who beareth unjustly the torments~
of the persecutors, who hath robbed no man, who hath violently oppressed no man,~
who hath shed the blood of no man, who hath imagined to defile the bed of no man,~
who is debtor to the laws in nothing, and who is punished more grievously than~
if he were a robber who speaketh righteousness, and there is none that will~
hear who speaketh salvation, and all men fight against him who is able to~
say When I spoke unto them, they fought against me without a cause. (Ps.~
cxix. 7.) They fight against him without a cause, who can lay no sin to his~
charge; they fight against him as an evildoer, who is by their own~
acknowledgment righteous they fight against him as a warlock, who glorieth in~
the name of the Lord, and who doeth all things well because he doeth all things~
for God's sake.

[Lectio6]
They fight against him in vain who is accused of ungodliness among the ungodly~
and the unfaithful, because he teacheth Faith. Verily, him that is fought~
against without a cause it behoveth to be strong and patient. Wherefore then~
saith he My heart standeth in awe of thy word? Awe is the mark of the weak,~
the timid, and the fearful. But there is also a weakness unto salvation, there~
is a fear which is an holy fear. O fear the Lord, all ye His Saints. (Ps.~
xxxiii. 10.) And again: Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord. (Ps. cxi. i.)~
And wherefore is he blessed? because he delighteth greatly in His commandments.

[Lectio93]
!Commemoratio S. Theclae Virginis et Martyris 
This virgin Thecla was the daughter of noble parents at Iconium, and a disciple~
of the Apostle Paul. She is the subject of extraordinary praises by the holy~
Fathers. In the eighteenth year of her age, she parted from one Thamiris, to~
whom she had been betrothed, and her kindred accused her of being a Christian. A~
pile was set a-fire for her, unless she should deny Christ, but she made the~
sign of the Cross, and willingly entered it, and rain came, and put out the~
fire. She came to Antioch, where they threw her to wild beasts; and strove to~
tear her asunder, by tying her to oxen driven different ways; and cast her into a~
pit with many snakes; but by the mercy of Jesus Christ she was delivered from~
all. The warmth of her faith and the holiness of her life brought many to~
Christ. She returned into her own country, and withdrew to be an hermit, alone~
on a certain mountain, and passed away to be with the Lord, aged ninety years,~
and famous for many good works and miracles. She was buried at Seleucia.
