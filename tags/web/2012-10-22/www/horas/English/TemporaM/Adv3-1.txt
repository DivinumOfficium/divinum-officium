Lesson from the book of Isaias
!Isa 28:1-3
1 WOE to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, and to the fading~
flower the glory of his joy, who were on the head of the fat valley, staggering~
with wine.
2 Behold the Lord is mighty and strong, as a storm of hail: a destroying~
whirlwind, as the violence of many waters overflowing, and sent forth upon a~
spacious land.
3 The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim shall be trodden under feet.

!Isa 28:4-7
4 And the fading flower the glory of his joy, who is on the head of the fat~
valley, shall be as a hasty fruit before the ripeness of autumn: which when he~
that seeth it shall behold, as soon as he taketh it in his hand, he will eat it~
up.
5 In that day the Lord of hosts shall be a crown of glory, and a garland of joy~
to the residue of his people:
6 And a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and strength to them~
that return out of the battle to the gate.
7 But these also have been ignorant through wine, and through drunkenness have~
erred: the priest and the prophet have been ignorant through drunkenness, they~
are swallowed up with wine, they have gone astray in drunkenness, they have not~
known him that seeth, they have been ignorant of judgment.

!Isa 28:16-18
16 Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Behold I will lay a stone in the~
foundations of Sion, a tried stone, a corner stone, a precious stone, founded in~
the foundation. He that believeth, let him not hasten.
17 And I will set judgment in weight, and justice in measure: and hail shall~
overturn the hope of falsehood: and waters shall overflow its protection.
18 And Sour league with death shall be abolished, and your covenant with hell~
shall not stand: when the overflowing scourge shall pass, you shall be trodden~
down by it.

There shall come forth a rod * out of the stem of Jesse, and the whole earth~
shall be filled with the glory of the Lord, and all flesh shall see the~
salvation of God.

[Ant 3]
All generations shall call me blessed, * for God hath regarded the lowliness of~
His hand-maiden.
