03-13# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 35: Concerning the Weekly Kitcheners
_
Let the brethren serve in turn, in such wise that not one be excused from the office of kitchener, except either by reason of sickness, or if any be occupied in some other matter of special usefulness; for in such wise is charity acquired and greater merit. But to the weak let help be accorded, that they fulfil this office without sadness; and indeed let all have help according to the size of the community and the circumstances of the place. If the community be large, let the cellarer be excused from the kitchen; and also, as we have said, if there be any others who are occupied with important business.

But the rest, let them, in the name of charity, take turns in serving. On Saturday let him who is about to go out from his week of service clean up everything. Let him wash the towels with which the brethren dry their hands and feet: and let both him who goes out and him who is about to enter alike wash the feet of all. Let him reconsign to the cellarer the vessels of his service, clean and whole; and let the cellarer reassign them to the one who comes in, that he may know what he gives and what he receives.
