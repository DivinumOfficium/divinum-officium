!!The Blessing of the Palms,
! After the holy water has been sprinkled and the Asperges me has been sung, the priest in purple cope, with his ministers also vested in purple, proceeds to the blessing of the palms, or of branches of olive or other trees which are placed in front or on the epistle side of the altar. The choir sings first the following anthem:
_
!Antiphon
!Matt 21:9
Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is He that cometh in the Name of the Lord. O King of Israel: Hosanna in the highest!
_
! The the priest, standing on the epistle side, his hands joined but without turning towards the faithful, sings:
V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with thy spirit.
_
v. Let us pray. 
O God, whom to love above all is righteousness, multiply in us the gifts of Thine ineffable grace: and since Thou hast given us in the death of Thy Son to hope for those things which we believe, grant us by the Resurrection of the same to attain the end to which we aspire. Who with Thee liveth and reigneth in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God, world without end.
_
_
! The subdeacon then sings the following lesson, and at its close kisses the hand of the priest:
_
!!Lesson
Lesson from the Book of Exodus.
!Exodus 15. 27; 16. 1-7
In those days the children of Israel came into Elim, where there were twelve fountains of water, and seventy palm trees; and they encamped by the waters. And they set forward from Elim, and all the multitude of the children of Israel came into the desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai: the fifteenth day of the second month after they came out of the land of Egypt. And all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness. And the children of Israel said to them: Would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when we sat over the fleshpots and ate bread to the full. Why have you brought us into this desert, that you might destroy all the multitude with famine? And the Lord said to Moses: Behold I will rain bread from heaven for you; let the people go forth and gather what is sufficient for every day; that I may prove them whether they will walk in My law or not. But the sixth day let them provide for to bring in; and let it be double to that they were wont to gather every day. And Moses and Aaron said to the children of Israel: In the evening you shall know that the Lord hath brought you forth out of the land of Egypt; and in the morning you shall see the glory of the Lord.
$Deo gratias

! The following responsory is then sung as Gradual:
!!Graduale
!John 11:47-50; 53
R. The chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council and said: What do we, for this man doth many miracles? If we let Him alone so, all will believe in Him;
R. And the Romans will come, and take away our place and nation.
V. But one of them, called Caiphas, being the high priest that year, prophesied, saying: It is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not. From that day, therefore, they devised to put Him to death, saying:
R. And the Romans will come, and take away our place and nation.
_
! Or this other:
!Matt 26:39-41
R. On mount Olivet He prayer to His Father: Father, if it may be, let this chalice pass from Me.
R. The spirit is indeed willing, but the flesh weak; Thy will be done.
V. Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.
R. The spirit is indeed willing, but the flesh weak; Thy will be done.
_
_
! Meanwhile, while the responsory is sung, the deacon puts the gospel book on the altar and the priest puts incense into the thurible. Prayer Munda cor, etc. 
v. Cleanse my heart and my lips, O almighty God, who didst cleanse the lips of the prophet Isaias with a burning coal, and vouchsafe, through Thy gracious mercy, so to purify me, that I may worthily announce Thy holy Gospel. Through Christ our Lord. Amen. 
! Afterwards he takes the book from the altar, and again kneeling down before the priest, asks his blessing, saying:
D. Sir, give me thy blessing. 	
! The priest answers:
P. The Lord be in thy heart and on thy lips, that thou mayest worthily and in a becoming manner, proclaim His holy Gospel. In the name of the Father, the Son + and the Holy Spirit.
! The Gospel is sung by the deacon with all the ceremonies usual at High Mass.
!!GOSPEL 
Continuation ++ of the holy Gospel according to St. Matthew. 	
!Matth. 21. 1-9
At that time, when Jesus drew nigh to Jerusalem, and was come to Bethphage, unto Mount Olivet, then He sent two disciples, saying to them: Go ye into the village that is over against you, and immediately you shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her; loose them and bring them to Me; and if any man shall say anything to you, say ye that the Lord hath need of them; and forthwith he will let them go. Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: Tell ye the daughter of Sion: Behold thy King cometh to thee meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of her that is used to the yoke. And the disciples going did as Jesus commanded them. And they brought the ass and the colt, and laid their garments upon them, and made Him sit thereon. And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way, and others cut boughs from the trees, and strewed them in the way, and the multitudes that went before and that followed cried, saying: Hosanna to the Son of David; Blessed is He that cometh in the Name of the Lord.
R. Praise be to Thee, O Christ.
S. By the words of the Gospel may our sins be blotted out.
_
_
!!Blessing of the palms.
! The priest still standing at the epistle corner, sings:
V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with thy spirit.
v. Let us pray. Increase, O God, the faith of them that hope in Thee, and in Thy mercy hear the prayers of Thy suppliant people; let Thy multiplied mercy descend upon us, and may these branches of palm (olive) trees be blessed; and as in a figure of Thy Church Thou didst multiply Noah going forth from the ark, and Moses going out of Egypt with the children of Israel, so may we go forth to meet Christ with good works, bearing palms and olive branches; and enter through Him into everlasting joy; Who with Thee and the Holy Ghost liveth and reigneth for ever and ever.
R. Amen.
V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with thy spirit.
V. Lift up your hearts.
R. We have them lifted up to the Lord.
V. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
R. It is meet and just. It is truly meet and just, right and availing unto salvation, that we should always and in all places give thanks unto Thee, O Lord, Father almighty, everlasting God. Who dost glory in the assembly of Thy Saints. For Thy creatures serve Thee, because they acknowledge Thee as their only Creator and God; and Thy whole creation praiseth Thee, and Thy Saints bless Thee. For with free voice they confess that great Name of Thine only-begotten Son before the kings and powers of this world. Around whom the Angels and Archangels, the Thrones and Dominions stand; and with all the host of the heavenly army, sing the hymn of Thy glory, saying without ceasing:
! The priest says and the choir sings:
v. Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of hosts. Heaven and earth are full of Thy glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is He that cometh in the Name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.
_
_
! The priest continues:
V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with thy spirit.
v. Let us pray. We beseech Thee, O holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God, that Thou wouldst vouchsafe to bless + and hallow + this creature of the olive tree, which Thou didst cause to shoot out of the substance of the wood, and which the dove when returning to the ark brought in its mouth: that whosoever shall receive it may find protection of soul and body; and that it may be to us, O Lord, a saving remedy and the sacred sign of Thy grace. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son,
$Qui vivis
_
_
v. Let us pray. O God, who dost gather what is dispersed abroad, and preserve what is gathered together; who didst bless the people who went forth to meet Jesus, bearing branches of palms; bless + likewise these branches of palm and olive, which Thy servants receive faithfully in honor of Thy Name; that into whatsoever place they shall be brought, those who dwell in that place may obtain Thy blessing, and all adversities being removed, Thy right hand may protect those who have been redeemed by our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son.
$Qui vivis
_
_
v. Let us pray. 
O God, who, by the wonderful order of Thy disposition, hast been pleased to manifest the dispensation of our salvation even from things insensible: grant, we beseech Thee, that the devout hearts of Thy faithful may understand to their benefit what is mystically signified by the fact that on this day the multitude, taught by a eavenly illumination, went forth to meet their Redeemer, and strewed branches of palms and olive at His feet. The branches of palms, therefore, represent His triumphs over the prince of death; and the branches of olive proclaim, in a manner, the coming of a spiritual unction. For that pious multitude understood that these things were then prefigured; that our Redeemer, compassionating human miseries, was about to fight with the prince of death for the life of the whole world, and, by dying, to triumph. For which cause they dutifully ministered such things as signified in Him the triumphs of victory and the richness of mercy. And we also, with full faith, retaining this as done and signified, humbly beseech Thee, O holy Lord, Father almighty, everlasting God, through the same Jesus Christ our Lord, that in Him and through Him, whose members Thou hast been pleased to make us, we may become victorious over the empire of death, and may deserve to be partakers of His glorious Resurrection.
$Qui vivis
_
_
v. Let us pray. 
O God, who by an olive branch didst command the dove to proclaim peace to the earth: hallow, we beseech Thee, by Thy heavenly blessing these branches of the olive and other trees; that they may profit all Thy people unto salvation. Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
_
_
v. Let us pray. 
Bless, + we beseech Thee, O Lord, these branches of palm (olive): and grant that what Thy people today bodily perform for Thy honor, they may perfect spiritually with the utmost devotion, by gaining the victory over the enemy, and ardently loving every work of mercy.
$Per Dominum.
_
_
! Here the celebrant puts incense into the thurible and sprinkles the palms thrice with holy water, reciting the anthem Asperges me without the psalm; then he incenses them thrice, and preceeds:
V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with thy spirit.
v. Let us pray. 
O God, who for our salvation didst send into this world Thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord, that He might humble Himself unto our state, and call us back to Thee; for whom also, as He entered into Jerusalem to fulfill the Scriptures, a multitude of faithful people, with zealous devotion, strewed their garments, with palm branches, in the way: grant, we beseech Thee, that we may prepare for Him the way of faith, from which the stone of offense and rock of scandal being removed, our works may flourish before Thee with branches of justice, that so we may be found worthy to follow His footsteps:
$Qui tecum
_
_
! When the blessing is finished, the first in rank among the clergy goes up to the altar and gives a palm to the celebrant, who neither genuflects nor kisses his hand. The priest then distributes the palms, first to the clergy, and afterwards to the laity, who all genuflect and kiss both the palm and the hand of the celebrant. Meanwhile the choir sings the following anthems
_
!!PUERI HEBRAEORUM
Ant. The Hebrew children bearing olive branches, went forth to meet the Lord, crying out, and saying, Hosanna in the highest. 
Ant. The Hebrew children spread their garments in the way, and cried out, saying: Hosanna to the Son of God: blessed is He that cometh in the Name of the Lord.
! If there are not enough, they must be repeated until the distribution of palms is finished. Then the celebrant says:
V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with your spirit
v. Let us pray. Almighty and everlasting God, who didst ordain that our Lord Jesus Christ should sit upon the foal of an ass, and didst teach the multitude to spread their garments or branches of trees in the way and to sing Hosanna to His praise: grant, we beseech Thee, that we may be able to imitate their innocence and deserve to partake of their merit.
$Per eundem
_
_
! The procession of palms now takes place. When the priest places incense in the thurible, the deacon, turning towards the people, sings:
V. Let us go forth in peace.
R. In the Name of Christ, Amen.
! The thurifer precedes with the smoking censer, followed by the subdeacon, bearing the processional cross between two acolytes carrying lighted candles. Then follow the clergy in order of rank, and finally the celebrant with the deacon on his left. All carry palms, and all or some of them sing the following anthems, during the whole time the procession lasts.
_
!ANTHEM
!Matth. 21. 1-3, 7-9
v. When our Lord drew nigh to Jerusalem, He sent two of His disciples, saying: Go ye into the village over against you; and you shall find an ass's colt tied, on which no man hath sat: loose it, and bring it to Me. If any man shall question you, say: The Lord hath need of it. They loosed it and brought it to Jesus, and laid their garments upon it, and He seated Himself on it; some spread their garments in the way; others strewed branches from the trees; and those who followed cried out: Hosanna! Blessed is He that cometh in the Name of the Lord; blessed be the reign of our father David! Hosanna in the highest! O Son of David, have mercy on us! 
_
!Antiphon 
!John 12:12-13
v. When the people heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, they took palm branches, and went forth to meet Him; and the children cried out, saying: This is He that is come for the salvation of the people. He is our salvation, and the redemption of Israel. How great is He whom the Thrones and Dominions go forth to meet! Fear not, O daughter of Sion; behold thy King cometh to thee sitting on an ass's colt, as it is written. Hail, O King, Creator of the world, who art come to redeem us!
_
v. Six days before the solemn feast of the Passover, when our Lord came into the city of Jerusalem, the children met Him: and in their hands they caried palm branches, and they cried out with a loud voice, saying: Hosanna in the highest! Blessed art Thou who art come in the multitude of Thy mercy. Hosanna in the highest!
_
v. The multitude goeth forth to meet our Redeemer with flowers and palms, and payeth the homage due to a triumphant Conqueror: the Gentiles proclaim the Son of God; and their voices thunder through the skies in praise of Christ: Hosanna in the highest!
_
v. Let the faithful join with the Angels and children, singing to the Conqueror of dath: Hosanna in the highest!
_
v. A great multitude that was met together at the festival cried out to the Lord: Blessed is He that cometh in the Name of the Lord: Hosanna in the Highest!
_
_
! At the return of the procession two or four cantors go into the church and, shutting the door, stand facing towards the procession, singing the two first verses of the Gloria laus. These the priest repeats with those who are outside the church. The other verses, all or in part as may be found desirable, are then sung by those within, thoses remaining ourside answering Gloria, laus . . . after every second verse:
_
V. Glory, praise and honor to Thee, O King Christ, the Redeemer: to whom children poured their glad and sweet hosanna's song.
R. Glory, praise and honor to Thee, O King Christ, the Redeemer: to whom children poured their glad and sweet hosanna's song.
_
v. Hail, King of Israel! David's Son of royal fame! Who comest in the Name of the Lord, O Blessed King.
R. Glory, praise and honor to Thee, O King Christ, the Redeemer: to whom children poured their glad and sweet hosanna's song.
_
v. The Angel host laud Thee on high, On earth mankind, with all created things.
_
R.: Glory, praise and honor to Thee, O King Christ, the Redeemer: to whom children poured their glad and sweet hosanna's song.
_
v. With palms the Jews went forth to meet Thee. We greet Thee now with prayers and hymns.
_
R.: Glory, praise and honor to Thee, O King Christ, the Redeemer: to whom children poured their glad and sweet hosanna's song.
_
v. On Thy way to die, they crowned Thee with praise; We raise our song to Thee, now King on high.
_
R.: Glory, praise and honor to Thee, O King Christ, the Redeemer: to whom children poured their glad and sweet hosanna's song.
_
v. Their poor homage pleased Thee, O gracious King! O clement King, accept too ours, the best that we can bring.
_
R.: Glory, praise and honor to Thee, O King Christ, the Redeemer: to whom children poured their glad and sweet hosanna's song.
_
_
! After this, the subdeacon knocks thrice on the door with the shaft of the processional cross: when the door is opened, the procession enters the church, singing:
!!RESPONSORY
v. As our Lord entered the holy city, the Hebrew children, declaring the resuurection of life, 
R. With palm branches, cried out: Hosanna in the highest. 
V.: When the people heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, they went forth to meet Him: 
R. With palm branches, cried out: Hosanna in the highest. 
_
! The Gloria Patri is not said. The Mass is then celebrated, and at Mass all hold the palms in their hands while the Passion and Gospel are sung.

Olvasmány szent Pál apostol Filippiekhez irott levelébõl
!Phil 2:5 - 11.
v. Ugyanazt a lelkületet ápoljátok magatokban, amely Krisztus Jézusban volt.  Õ Isten formájában volt, és az Istennel való egyenlõséget nem tartotta olyan dolognak, amelyhez föltétlenül ragaszkodnia kell,  hanem kiüresítette magát, szolgai alakot öltött, és hasonló lett az emberekhez. Külsejét tekintve olyan lett, mint egy ember.  Megalázta magát és engedelmeskedett mindhalálig, mégpedig a kereszthalálig.  Ezért Isten felmagasztalta, és olyan nevet adott neki, amely fölötte van minden névnek,  hogy Jézus nevére hajoljon meg minden térd a mennyben, a földön és az alvilágban,  s minden nyelv hirdesse az Atyaisten dicsõségére, hogy Jézus Krisztus az Úr.

[Evangelium]
Evangélium + szent Máté Apostol kõnyvébõl
!Matt 26:1-75; 27:1-66.
v. Amikor Jézus ezeket a beszédeket befejezte, így szólt tanítványaihoz:  "Tudjátok, hogy két nap múlva itt a húsvét. Az Emberfiát kereszthalálra adják."  Akkor összegyûltek a fõpapok és a nép vénei Kaifás fõpap palotájában,  és tanácsot tartottak, hogyan tudnák Jézust csellel elfogni és megölni.  Mindamellett megállapodtak: "Ne az ünnepen, nehogy zavargás támadjon a nép közt."  Amikor Jézus Betániában a leprás Simon házában tartózkodott,  odament hozzá egy asszony. Alabástrom edényben drága illatos olajat hozott, s ahogy ott ült az asztalnál, a fejére öntötte.  Ennek láttára a tanítványok bosszankodtak: "Mire való ez a pazarlás?  Hisz jó pénzért el lehetett volna adni, s az árát a szegények közt szétosztani."  Jézus észrevette, s így szólt hozzájuk: "Miért bántjátok ezt az asszonyt? Hisz jót tett velem.  Szegények mindig lesznek veletek, de én nem maradok mindig veletek.  Amikor az illatos olajat testemre öntötte, a temetésemre tette.  Bizony mondom nektek, ahol a világon csak hirdetni fogják az evangéliumot, mindenütt megemlékeznek majd arról is, amit ez az asszony tett."  Ekkor a tizenkettõ közül az egyik, a karióti Júdás, elment a fõpapokhoz,  és ezt kérdezte tõlük: "Mit adtok nekem, ha kezetekre adom?" Azok harminc ezüstöt fizettek neki.  Attól kezdve már csak a kedvezõ alkalmat kereste, hogy kiszolgáltassa nekik.  A kovásztalan kenyér ünnepének elsõ napján a tanítványok ezzel a kérdéssel fordultak Jézushoz: "Hogy akarod, hol készítsük el neked a húsvéti vacsorát?"  Így felelt: "Menjetek be a városba ehhez meg ehhez, és mondjátok meg neki, hogy a Mester üzeni: Közel az idõm, nálad költöm el tanítványaimmal a húsvéti vacsorát."  A tanítványok úgy tettek, ahogy Jézus meghagyta nekik, elkészítették számára a húsvéti bárányt.  Amikor beesteledett, asztalhoz ült a tizenkét tanítvánnyal.  Vacsora közben megszólalt: "Bizony mondom nektek, egyiketek elárul."  Erre igen elszomorodtak és sorra megkérdezték: "Csak nem én vagyok az, Uram?"  "Aki velem egyszerre nyúl a tálba, az árul el" - felelte.  Az Emberfia ugyan elmegy, amint megírták róla, de jaj annak az embernek, aki az Emberfiát elárulja. Jobb lett volna neki, ha meg sem születik."  Erre Júdás, az árulója is megkérdezte: "Csak nem én vagyok az, mester?" "Magad mondtad" - válaszolta.  Vacsora közben Jézus kezébe vette a kenyeret, megáldotta, megtörte s odanyújtotta tanítványainak, ezekkel a szavakkal: "Vegyétek és egyétek, ez az én testem!"  Aztán fogta a kelyhet, hálát adott, és ezekkel a szavakkal nyújtotta nekik: "Igyatok ebbõl mindnyájan,  mert ez az én vérem, a szövetségé, amelyet sokakért kiontanak a bûnök bocsánatára.  Mondom nektek, mostantól nem iszom a szõlõ termésébõl addig, amíg majd az újat nem iszom veletek Atyám országában."  Ezután elénekelték a zsoltárt és kimentek az Olajfák-hegyére.  Akkor Jézus mondta: "Ma éjszaka mindnyájan megbotránkoztok bennem. Írva van: Megverem a pásztort, és szétszélednek a nyáj juhai.  De feltámadásom után majd elõttetek megyek Galileába."  Péter fogadkozott: "Ha mindnyájan megbotránkoznak is, én nem botránkozom meg soha."  Jézus csak ennyit mondott: "Bizony mondom neked, még az éjjel, mielõtt a kakas szól, háromszor megtagadsz."  Péter erõsködött: "Még ha meg kell is veled halnom, akkor sem tagadlak meg." Ugyanígy beszélt a többi tanítványa is.  Közben odaért velük a Getszemáni nevû majorba. "Üljetek le - mondta tanítványainak -, én arrébb megyek és imádkozom."  Csak Pétert és Zebedeus két fiát vitte magával. Egyszerre szomorúság fogta el, és gyötrõdni kezdett.  "Halálosan szomorú a lelkem - mondta nekik. - Maradjatok itt és virrasszatok velem!"  Valamivel odébb ment, és arcra borulva így imádkozott: "Atyám, ha lehetséges, kerüljön el ez a kehely, de ne úgy legyen, ahogy én akarom, hanem ahogyan te!"  Aztán visszament tanítványaihoz, de alva találta õket. Szemére vetette Péternek: "Még egy órát sem tudtok velem virrasztani?  Virrasszatok és imádkozzatok, nehogy kísértésbe essetek. A lélek ugyan készséges, a test azonban erõtlen."  Másodszor is elment és így imádkozott: "Atyám, ha nem kerülhet el ez a kehely anélkül, hogy ki ne igyam, legyen akaratod szerint!"  Amikor visszatért, megint alva találta õket.  Erre otthagyta õket, újra elment, és harmadszor is ugyanazokkal a szavakkal imádkozott.  Aztán visszament tanítványaihoz, s így szólt: "Aludjatok csak és pihenjetek! Elérkezett az óra. Az Emberfiát a bûnösök kezére adják.  Keljetek föl, menjünk! Nézzétek, itt jön, aki elárul."  Még beszélt, amikor odaért Júdás, a tizenkettõ közül az egyik, s vele a fõpapoknak és a nép véneinek megbízásából egy kardokkal és dorongokkal fölszerelt csapat.  Az áruló jelben egyezett meg velük. "Akit megcsókolok - mondta -, õ az, fogjátok el!"  Azzal mindjárt Jézushoz lépett. "Üdvözöllek, Mester!" - mondta, és megcsókolta.  Jézus megkérdezte: "Barátom, miért jöttél?" Erre körülfogták Jézust, kezet emeltek rá, és foglyul ejtették.  Jézus kísérõi közül az egyik kardjához kapott, kirántotta, a fõpap szolgájára sújtott és levágta a fülét.  Jézus rászólt: "Tedd vissza hüvelyébe kardodat! Aki kardot ragad, az kard által vész el.  Vagy azt hiszed, hogy nem kérhetem Atyámat, s nem küldene tizenkét légió angyalnál is többet?  De akkor hogy teljesedne be az Írás, amely szerint ennek így kell történnie?"  Abban az órában Jézus azt mondta a tömegnek: "Mint valami rabló ellen, úgy vonultatok ki kardokkal és dorongokkal, hogy elfogjatok. Naponta ott voltam a templomban, és tanítottam, mégsem fogtatok el.  Ez mind azért történt, hogy beteljesedjenek a próféták írásai." Erre a tanítványok mind elhagyták és elmenekültek.  Akik elfogták Jézust, Kaifás fõpap elé hurcolták. Ott már együtt voltak az írástudók és a nép vénei.  Péter messzirõl követte, egészen a fõpap palotájáig. Bement és leült a szolgák közé, hogy lássa, mi lesz a dolog vége.  A fõpapok és az egész fõtanács hamis bizonyítékokat kerestek Jézus ellen, hogy halálra ítélhessék,  de mivel nem találtak, sok hamis tanú jelentkezett. Végre jött kettõ,  s így vádaskodott: "Azt állította: Le tudom bontani az Isten templomát, és három nap alatt újra fel tudom építeni."  A fõpap erre felállt és megkérdezte: "Nem felelsz semmit arra, amivel ezek vádolnak?"  Jézus hallgatott. A fõpap folytatta: "Esküvel kényszerítlek az élõ Istenre, mondd meg, te vagy-e a Messiás, az Isten Fia?"  "Magad mondtad - felelte Jézus. - De mondom nektek, mostantól látni fogjátok az Emberfiát, amint a Hatalom jobbján ül, és amint majd eljön az ég felhõin."  A fõpap erre megszaggatta ruháját s felkiáltott: "Káromkodott! Mi szükségünk van még tanúkra? Magatok is hallottátok a káromkodást.  Mi a véleményetek?" "Méltó a halálra!" - kiabálták.  Aztán szembeköpdösték, és ököllel verték, mások arcul ütötték,  és közben kérdezgették: "Találd ki, Messiás, ki ütött meg!"  Péter kint ült az udvaron. Odament hozzá egy szolgáló, és megszólította: "Te is a galileai Jézussal voltál."  De õ mindnyájuk hallatára tagadta: "Nem értem, mit beszélsz."  Amikor kifelé tartott a kapun, egy másik szolgáló is észrevette: "Ez is a názáreti Jézussal volt" - mondta a többieknek.  Megint tagadta, most már esküvel: "Nem ismerem azt az embert."  Röviddel ezután az ott állók körülfogták Pétert és bizonygatták: "De bizony, közéjük tartozol te is, hiszen beszéded is elárul."  Erre már esküdözni és átkozódni kezdett: "Nem ismerem azt az embert!" Azon nyomban megszólalt a kakas.  Péternek akkor eszébe jutott Jézus szava: "Mielõtt a kakas szól, háromszor megtagadsz." Kiment, és keserves sírásra fakadt.  Amikor megvirradt, a fõpapok és a nép vénei tanácsot tartottak és elhatározták, hogy halálra adják.  Megkötözték, elvezették, és átadták Pilátus helytartónak.  Amikor Júdás, az áruló látta, hogy elítélték, megbánta tettét, és visszavitte a harminc ezüstöt a fõpapoknak és a véneknek.  "Vétkeztem - mondta -, elárultam az igaz vért." "Mi közünk hozzá? - válaszolták. - A te dolgod!"  Erre az ezüstöt beszórta a templomba, aztán elment és felakasztotta magát.  A fõpapok fölszedték a pénzt, de úgy vélték: "Nem szabad a templom kincstárába tenni, mert vér díja."  Tanácsot tartottak, és megvették rajta a fazekas telkét az idegenek számára temetõnek.  Ezért hívják azt a telket még ma is Vérmezõnek.  Így beteljesedett, amit Jeremiás próféta jövendölt: Fogtam a harminc ezüstöt, annak árát, akit ennyire becsültek, akit Izrael fiai becsültek ennyire,  s a fazekas telkéért adták, ahogy az Úr parancsolta nekem.  Közben Jézust a helytartó elé állították. A helytartó megkérdezte tõle: "Te vagy a zsidók királya?" "Te mondod" - felelte Jézus.  A fõpapok és vének vádjaira azonban nem felelt semmit.  Erre Pilátus így szólt hozzá: "Nem hallod, mi mindennel vádolnak?"  De õ egyetlen vádjukra sem felelt. Ezen a helytartó igen meglepõdött.  Az ünnep napján a helytartó szabadon szokott bocsátani egy rabot, a nép kívánsága szerint.  Volt akkor egy hírhedt rabjuk, Barabásnak hívták.  Pilátus kérdést intézett hozzájuk: "Mit akartok, melyiket bocsássam el a kettõ közül, Barabást vagy Jézust, akit Krisztusnak mondanak?"  Tudta ugyanis, hogy csak irigységbõl adták kezére.  Míg ott ült ítélõszékében, a felesége üzenetet küldött neki: "Ne legyen közöd annak az embernek a dolgához! Az éjjel álmomban sokat szenvedtem miatta."  A fõpapok és a vének felbujtották a népet, hogy Barabást kérje ki, Jézusnak pedig kívánja halálát.  A helytartó tehát föltette a kérdést: "Mit akartok, melyiket bocsássam el a kettõ közül?" "Barabást!" - kiáltották.  Pilátus tovább kérdezte: "Hát Jézussal, akit Krisztusnak mondanak, mit tegyek?" Mind azt kiabálták: "Keresztre vele!"  "De hát mi rosszat tett?" - kérdezte. Annál inkább ordították: "Keresztre vele!"  Pilátus látta, hogy nem megy semmire, sõt a zajongás még fokozódik is. Vizet hozatott, s a nép szeme láttára megmosta kezét: "Ennek az igaz embernek vére ontásában én ártatlan vagyok - mondta. - Ti lássátok!"  Erre az egész tömeg zúgta: "Vére rajtunk és fiainkon!"  Akkor szabadon bocsátotta Barabást, Jézust pedig megostoroztatta, és átadta nekik, hogy feszítsék keresztre.  A helytartó katonái bevitték Jézust a helytartóságra, s odagyûjtötték köré az egész helyõrséget.  Megfosztották ruhájától, bíborszínû köntöst adtak rá.  Tövisbõl koszorút fontak, fejére tették, jobb kezébe pedig nádszálat adtak. Aztán térdet hajtottak elõtte, és így gúnyolták: "Üdvözlégy, zsidók királya!"  Közben leköpdösték, fogták a nádat s verték a fejét.  Miután így csúfot ûztek belõle, levették róla a palástot, s ráadták saját ruháját. Aztán elvezették, hogy keresztre feszítsék.  Amint kifelé vonultak, találkoztak egy Simon nevû cirenei emberrel. Ezt kényszerítették, hogy vigye a keresztet.  Fölértek arra a helyre, amelynek Golgota, vagyis Koponyák helye volt a neve.  Itt epével kevert bort adtak neki inni, de amikor megízlelte, nem akarta meginni.  Aztán keresztre feszítették, és sorsot vetve megosztoztak ruháján,  majd leheveredtek, és õrizték.  Feje fölé táblát tettek, amelyre elítélése okát írták: "Ez Jézus, a zsidók királya."  Vele együtt két gonosztevõt is keresztre feszítettek, az egyiket jobbról, a másikat balról.  Az arra menõk káromolták, s fejüket csóválva  mondogatták: "Te, aki lebontod és harmadnapra fölépíted a templomot, szabadítsd meg magad! Ha Isten Fia vagy, szállj le a keresztrõl!"  Ugyanígy gúnyolódtak az írástudókkal és a vénekkel együtt a fõpapok is:  "Másokat megmentett, de magát nem tudja megmenteni. Ha Izrael királya, szálljon le a keresztrõl, s akkor hiszünk neki.  Az Istenben bízott. Mentse hát meg, ha akarja. Hisz azt mondta: Isten Fia vagyok."  Ilyen módon gyalázták a vele együtt megfeszített gonosztevõk is.  A hatodik órától a kilencedik óráig sötétség borult az egész földre.  Kilenc óra tájban Jézus felkiáltott, hangosan mondva: "Éli, Éli, lamma szabaktani?" Vagyis: "Én Istenem, én Istenem, miért hagytál el engem?"  Ezt hallva az ott állók közül néhányan megjegyezték: "Illést hívja."  Egyikük rögtön odaszaladt, fogott egy ecetbe mártott szivacsot, rátûzte egy nádszálra, és inni adott neki.  A többiek meg így beszéltek: "Hadd lássuk, eljön-e Illés, hogy megszabadítsa!"  Most Jézus még egyszer hangosan felkiáltott, és kilehelte lelkét.  Erre a templom függönye kettéhasadt, felülrõl egészen az aljáig, a föld megrendült, sziklák repedtek meg,  sírok nyíltak meg, és sok elhunyt szentnek feltámadt a teste.  Feltámadása után elõjöttek a sírokból, bementek a szent városba, és többeknek megjelentek.  A százados és a többiek is, akik Jézust õrizték, a földrengés és a történtek láttára igen megijedtek: "Ez valóban Isten Fia volt" - mondták.  Messzirõl több asszony figyelte, mi történik; olyanok, akik Galileából eddig kísérték, és gondoskodtak róla.  Köztük volt Mária Magdolna, Mária, Jakab és József anyja, és Zebedeus fiainak az anyja.  Amikor már estére járt az idõ, jött egy József nevû jómódú arimateai ember, aki maga is Jézus tanítványa volt.  Bement Pilátushoz, és elkérte Jézus testét. Pilátus elrendelte, hogy adják ki neki.  József levette a testet, tiszta gyolcsba göngyölte,  s sziklába vájt új sírboltjába helyezte. A sír bejáratához nagy követ hengerített, és elment.  Mária Magdolna és a másik Mária ott maradtak, leültek a sírral szemben.  Másnap, a készület napjának elmúltával a fõpapok és az írástudók egybegyûltek Pilátusnál és  figyelmeztették: "Uram, emlékszünk rá, hogy az a csaló még életében azt állította: Harmadnapra feltámadok.  Rendeld hát el, hogy harmadnapig õrizzék a sírt, nehogy odamenjenek tanítványai és ellopják, aztán híreszteljék a nép között: Feltámadt a halálból. Ez utóbbi csalás rosszabb lenne az elõbbinél."  "Legyen õrségetek - válaszolta Pilátus -, menjetek, õrizzétek, ahogy csak tudjátok!"  Erre elmentek, lepecsételték a követ, és õrséget állítottak a sírhoz.
