Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus
!Ecclus 31:8-11
Happy the man found without fault, who turns not aside after gain, nor puts his trust in money nor in treasures! Who is he, that we may praise him? For he has done wonders in his life. He has been tested by gold and come off safe, and this remains his glory forever; he could have sinned but did not, could have done evil but would not, so that his possessions are secure in the Lord, and the assembly of the Saints shall recount his alms.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 19:12-26
At that time, Jesus spoke this parable to His disciples: A certain nobleman went~
into a far country to obtain for himself a kingdom and then return. And having~
summoned ten of his servants, he gave them ten gold pieces and said to them,~
‘Trade till I come.’ But his citizens hated him; and they sent a delegation~
after him to say, ‘We do not wish this man to be king over us.’ And it came to~
pass when he had returned, after receiving the kingdom, that he ordered the~
servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him in order that he~
might learn how much each one had made by trading. And the first came, saying,~
‘Lord, your gold piece has earned ten gold pieces.’ And he said to him, ‘Well~
done, good servant; because you have been faithful in a very little, you shall~
have authority over ten towns.’ Then the second came, saying, ‘Lord, your gold~
piece has made five gold pieces.’ And he said to him, ‘Be you also over five~
towns.’ And another came, saying, ‘Lord, behold your gold piece, which I have~
kept laid up in a napkin; for I feared you, because you are a stern man. You~
take up what you did not lay down, and you reap what you did not sow.’ He said~
to him, ‘Out of your own mouth I judge you, you wicked servant. You knew that I~
am a stern man, taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not~
sow. Why, then, did you not put my money in a bank, so that I on my return might~
have gotten it with interest?’ And he said to the bystanders, ‘Take away the~
gold piece from him, and give it to him who has the ten gold pieces.’ But they~
said to him, ‘Lord, he has ten gold pieces.’ I say to you that to everyone who~
has shall be given; but from him who does not have, even that which he has shall~
be taken away.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 88:25
My faithfulness and My kindness shall be with him, and through My name shall his~
horn be exalted. (Alleluia.)

[Secreta]
Look with favor, almighty God, upon the offerings we bring to you, and grant~
that we, who celebrate the mysteries of our Lord’s passion, may strive to~
imitate what we commemorate.
