04-27# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 69: That In the Monastery One Presume Not to Constitute Himself the Patron of Another
_
Precautions must be taken lest on any occasion one monk in the monastery presume to constitute himself the patron of another, or as it were to take him under his care, even although they be related by the tie of near kinship. Let no monk presume to do such a thing in any way whatever, because therefrom can arise very grave occasion of scandal. But if anyone shall have transgressed in this respect, let him be somewhat sharply punished.
