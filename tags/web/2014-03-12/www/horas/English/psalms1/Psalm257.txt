(Canticum Jeremiae * Jer 17:7-8)
17:7 Blessed be the man that trusteth in the Lord, and the Lord shall be his confidence.
17:8 And he shall be as a tree that is planted by the waters, that spreadeth out its roots towards moisture: and it shall not fear when the heat cometh. And the leaf thereof shall be green, and in the time of drought it shall not be solicitous, neither shall it cease at any time to bring forth fruit.
