128:1 (A gradual canticle.) Often have they fought against me from my youth, let Israel now say.
128:2 Often have they fought against me from my youth: but they could not prevail over me.
128:3 The wicked have wrought upon my back: they have lengthened their iniquity.
128:4 The Lord who is just will cut the necks of sinners:
128:5 Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Sion.
128:6 Let them be as grass upon the tops of houses: which withereth before it be plucked up:
128:7 Who with the mower filleth not his hand: nor he that gathereth sheaves his bosom.
128:8 And they that passed by have not said: The blessing of the Lord be upon you: we have blessed you in the name of the Lord.
