30:1 (Unto the end, a psalm for David, in an ecstasy.)
30:2 In thee, O Lord, have I hoped, let me never be confounded: deliver me in thy justice.
30:3 Bow down thy ear to me: make haste to deliver me. Be thou unto me a God, a protector, and a house of refuge, to save me.
30:4 For thou art my strength and my refuge; and for thy name's sake thou wilt lead me, and nourish me.
30:5 Thou wilt bring me out of this snare, which they have hidden for me: for thou art my protector.
30:6 Into thy hands I commend my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, the God of truth.
30:7 Thou hast hated them that regard vanities, to no purpose. But I have hoped in the Lord:
30:8 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy. For thou hast regarded my humility, thou hast saved my soul out of distresses.
30:9 And thou hast not shut me up in the hands of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a spacious place.
30:10 Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am afflicted: my eye is troubled with wrath, my soul, and my belly:
30:11 For my life is wasted with grief: and my years in sighs. My strength is weakened through poverty and my bones are disturbed.
30:12 I am become a reproach among all my enemies, and very much to my neighbours; and a fear to my acquaintance. They that saw me without fled from me.
30:13 I am forgotten as one dead from the heart. I am become as a vessel that is destroyed.
30:14 For I have heard the blame of many that dwell round about. While they assembled together against me, they consulted to take away my life.
30:15 But I have put my trust in thee, O Lord: I said: Thou art my God.
30:16 My lots are in thy hands. Deliver me out of the hands of my enemies; and from them that persecute me.
30:17 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; save me in thy mercy.
30:18 Let me not be confounded, O Lord, for I have called upon thee. Let the wicked be ashamed, and be brought down to hell.
30:19 Let deceitful lips be made dumb. Which speak iniquity against the just, with pride and abuse.
30:20 O how great is the multitude of thy sweetness, O Lord, which thou hast hidden for them that fear thee! Which thou hast wrought for them that hope in thee, in the sight of the sons of men.
30:21 Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy face, from the disturbance of men. Thou shalt protect them in thy tabernacle from the contradiction of tongues.
30:22 Blessed be the Lord, for he hath shewn his wonderful mercy to me in a fortified city.
30:23 But I said in the excess of my mind: I am cast away from before thy eyes. Therefore thou hast heard the voice of my prayer, when I cried to thee.
30:24 O love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord will require truth, and will repay them abundantly that act proudly.
30:25 Do ye manfully, and let your heart be strengthened, all ye that hope in the Lord.
