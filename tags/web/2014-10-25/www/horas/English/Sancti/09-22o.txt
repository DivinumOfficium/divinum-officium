[Lectio93]
When the Emperor Maximian led his army into Gaul, he stopped at the frontiers of~
the Seduni to offer a sacrifice. The Theban legion, that they might not be~
defiled by any share in the unhallowed rites, withdrew themselves from the rest~
of his army. Therefore the Emperor sent soldiers unto them to bid them in his~
name, if they valued their lives, come back into the camp to the sacrifice. They~
answered that the Christian religion did not allow them. This answer enkindled~
in him greater wrath than before. He therefore despatched a part of his army to~
the Thebans. with orders to begin by killing one man in every ten of them. By~
their own will, and at the urgent exhortation of Maurice, they chose rather to~
endure this martyrdom than to do the commandment of the unrighteous Emperor. At~
the last, the Emperor, upon the 22nd day of September, bade his whole army fall~
upon them and slay them all. They confessed Christ bravely even to the end.
