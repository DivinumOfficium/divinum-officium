02-23# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 18: In What Order the Psalms Themselves Are to Be Said. Continued.
_
Let Vespers be sung daily with four psalms and let these psalms be begun with the hundred and ninth and continue up to the hundred and forty-seventh, those of them excepted which are set apart for the other hours, namely from the hundred and seventeenth to the hundred and twenty-seventh; and the hundred and thirty-third and the hundred and forty-second. All the rest are to be said at Vespers. And because the psalms come short by three, therefore those are to be divided which of those enumerated above are found somewhat long, namely the hundred and thirty-eighth, the hundred and forty-third and the hundred and forty-fourth. But let the hundred and sixteenth, because it is short, be joined with the hundred and fifteenth. The order of the Vesper psalms having thus been arranged, let the rest, namely, lessons, responsories, hymns, versicles and canticles, be recited as we have above explained. But at Compline let the same psalms be repeated daily; that is to say the fourth, ninetieth and the hundred and thirty-third.
