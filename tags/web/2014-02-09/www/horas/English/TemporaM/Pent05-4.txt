Lesson from the second book of Samuel
!2 Sam 6:1-3
1 And David again gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty~
thousand.
2 And David arose and went, with all the people that were with him of the men of~
Juda to fetch the ark of God, upon which the name of the Lord of hosts is~
invoked, who sitteth over it upon the cherubims.
3 And they laid the ark of God upon a new cart: and took it out of the house of~
Abinadab, who was in Gabaa: and Oza, and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the~
new cart.

!2 Sam 6:4-7
4 And when they had taken it out of the house of Abinadab, who was in Gabaa,~
Ahio having care of the ark of God went before the ark.
5 But David and all Israel played before the Lord on all manner of instruments~
made of wood, on harps and lutes and timbrels and cornets and cymbals.
6 And when they came to the floor of Nachon, Oza put forth his hand to the ark~
of God, and took hold of it: because the oxen kicked and made it lean aside.
7 And the indignation of the Lord was enkindled against Oza, and he struck him~
for his rashness: and he died there before the ark of God.

!2 Sam 6:8-12
8 And David was grieved because the Lord had struck Oza, and the name of that~
place was called: The striking of Oza, to this day.
9 And David was afraid of the Lord that day, saying: How shall the ark of the~
Lord come to me?
10 And he would not have the ark of the Lord brought in to himself into the city~
of David: but he caused it to be carried into the house of Obededom the Gethite.
11 And the ark of the Lord abode in the house of Obededom the Gethite three~
months: and the Lord blessed Obededom, and all his household.
12 And it was told king David, that the Lord had blessed Obededom, and all that~
he had, because of the ark of God. So David went, and brought away the ark of~
God out of the house of Obededom into the city of David with joy. And there were~
with David seven choirs, and calves for victims.
