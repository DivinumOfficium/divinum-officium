De Canticis Canticorum
!Song 7:1-5
1 What shalt thou see in the Sulamitess but the companies of camps? How beautiful are thy steps in shoes, O prince's daughter! The joints of thy thighs are like jewels, that are made by the hand of a skillful workman. 
2 Thy navel is like a round bowl never wanting cups. Thy belly is like a heap of wheat, set about with lilies. 
3 Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins. 
4  Thy neck as a tower of ivory. Thy eyes like the fishpools in Hesebon, which are in the gate of the daughter of the multitude. Thy nose is as the tower of Libanus, that looketh toward Damascus. 
5 Thy head is like Carmel: and the hairs of thy head as the purple of the king bound in the channels.

!Song 7:6-13
6 How beautiful art thou, and how comely, my dearest, in delights! 
7 Thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes. 
8 I said: I will go up into the palm tree, and will take hold of the fruit thereof: and thy breasts shall be as the clusters of the vine: and the odour of thy mouth like apples. 
9 Thy throat like the best wine, worthy for my beloved to drink, and for his lips and his teeth to ruminate. [10] I to my beloved, and his turning is towards me.
11 Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field, let us abide in the villages. 
12 Let us get up early to the vineyards, let us see if the vineyard flourish, if the flowers be ready to bring forth fruits, if the pomegranates flourish: there will I give thee my breasts. 
13 The mandrakes give a smell. In our gates are all fruits: the new and the old, my beloved, I have kept for thee.

!Song 8:1-4
1  Who shall give thee to me for my brother, sucking the breasts of my mother, that I may find thee without, and kiss thee, and now no man may despise me? 
2  I will take hold of thee, and bring thee Into my mother's house: there thou shalt teach me, and I will give thee a cup of spiced wine and new wine of my pomegranates. 
3 His left hand under my head, and his right hand shall embrace me. 
4 I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that you stir not up, nor awake my love till she please.

From the Sermons of St Bernard, Abbat (of Clairvaux.)
!1st on the Assumption.
When the glorious Virgin this day mounted upon the heavens, without doubt, she~
abundantly increased the joy of the citizens above. This same is she the voice~
of whose salutation maketh to leap with joy even such as are still shut up in~
their mothers' bellies. (Luke i. 41, 44.) If the soul of an unborn babe melted~
when Mary spake, what must we imagine to have been the jubilation of the~
heavenly ones, when it was their reward at once to hear her voice, and to see~
her face, and to enjoy her blessed presence

But who also can picture to himself with what glory the Queen of the world went~
forth, and with what keen desire the whole multitude of the armies which are in~
heaven came out to meet her, with what hymns she was led to her throne of glory,~
with what a look of peace, with what a countenance of grace, with what Divine~
embraces her Son welcomed her, and set her above everything which God hath made?~
It was that be taken away from her. honour of which such a Mother was worthy,~
and with that glory which beseemed such a Son.

Sweet indeed were the kisses which the Suckling, Whom His Mother had praised~
while yet He lay hid in her virginal womb, pressed upon her lips. But shall we~
not believe that sweeter were those which she received from Him in blessed~
welcome, when He was sitting at the right hand of His Father, and she went up to~
the throne of His glory, singing the marriage-song and saying Let Him kiss me~
with the kisses of His mouth? (Cant. i. 2.) Who shall declare the generation of~
Christ or the Assumption of Mary So much as she found grace on earth more than~
others, so much more excellent than that of others is the glory which she hath~
in heaven.
