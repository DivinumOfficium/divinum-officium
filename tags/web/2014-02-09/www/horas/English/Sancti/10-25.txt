Lord, we beseech thee, that the prayers of thy blessed martyrs Chrysanthus and~
Daria may succour us, and they whom they honour, may make us feel the kindly~
power of their help.

[Lectio93]
Chrisantius and Daria were an husband and wife, of noble birth, but glorious~
rather for their faith, which the wife learnt from the husband. They brought to~
Christ a great number of persons at Rome, she women, and he men. Therefore the~
Praefect Celerinus caused them to be taken, and gave them over to Claudius the~
Tribune, who bade Chrysanthus to be tormented by the soldiers, all bound as he~
was, but all his bonds brake, and so likewise the shackles wherein his feet were~
afterwards fastened. Then was Chrysanthus sewn up in an ox' hide and set in the~
full heat of the sun, and thereafter chained hand and foot and cast into a dark~
prison, but the chains dropped off from him, and the place was filled with~
light. Meanwhile Daria was haled to a brothel, but God kept her from insult, a~
lion guarding her, and herself always rapt in prayer. Lastly they were both of~
them led to a sand-pit upon the Salarian Way, where they were thrown alive into~
an hole, and buried in stones, and so were not divided in winning the victory of~
Martyrdom.
