[Lectio]
Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians
!Eph 5:15-21
Brethren: See to it that you walk with care: not as unwise but as wise, making the most of your time, because the days are evil. Therefore, do not become foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. And do not be drunk with wine, for in that is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord, giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God the Father. Be subject to one another in the fear of Christ.

[Graduale]
!Ps 144:15-16
The eyes of all look hopefully to You, O Lord, and You give them their food in~
due season.
V. You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing. Alleluia,~
alleluia.
!Ps 107:2
V. My heart is steadfast, O God; my heart is steadfast; I will sing and chant~
praise to You, my glory. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 4:46-53
At that time, there was a certain royal official whose son was lying sick at~
Capharnaum. When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, he went~
to Him and besought Him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point~
of death. Jesus therefore said to him, Unless you see signs and wonders, you do~
not believe. The royal official said to Him, Sir, come down before my child~
dies. Jesus said to him, Go your way, your son lives. The man believed the word~
that Jesus spoke to him, and departed. But even as he was now going down, his~
servants met him and brought word saying that his son lived. He asked of them~
therefore the hour in which he had got better. And they told him, Yesterday, at~
the seventh hour, the fever left him. The father knew then that it was at that~
very hour in which Jesus had said to him, Your son lives. And he himself~
believed, and his whole household.
