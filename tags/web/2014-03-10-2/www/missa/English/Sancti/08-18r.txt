[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 12:24-26
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples, Amen, amen, I say to you, unless the~
grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone. But if it dies,~
it brings forth much fruit. He who loves his life, loses it; and he who hates~
his life in this world, keeps it unto life everlasting. If anyone serves Me, let~
him follow Me; and where I am there also shall My servant be. If anyone serves~
Me, My Father will honor him.

[Secreta]
Accept, O Lord, the gifts we bring on his festival by whose spiritual protection~
we hope to be saved.

[Postcommunio]
You have fed Your household, O Lord, with the holy sacrament; ever comfort us,~
we beseech You, by the intercession of him whose feast we are keeping.
