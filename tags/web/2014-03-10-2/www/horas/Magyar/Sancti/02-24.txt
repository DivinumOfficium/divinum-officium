O God, Who didst choose thy blessed servant Matthias to be of the number of the~
twelve Apostles, grant, we beseech thee, that thy Church, being upholden by his~
prayers, may ever feel about her the arms of thy most mighty protection.

From the Acts of Apostles
!Acts 1:15-18
15 Ezekben a napokban a testvérek körében - mintegy százhúszan lehettek együtt - Péter szólásra emelkedett: 
16 "Testvérek, férfiak! Be kellett teljesednie az Írásnak, amelyet a Szentlélek Dávid szájával Júdásról, azok vezetõjérõl jövendölt, akik elfogták Jézust. 
17 Közénk számított, a mi szolgálatunk jutott neki is részül. 
18 Gonoszsága bérén telket szerzett magának, amikor pedig lezuhant, kettérepedt és kifordultak a belei. 

[Lectio2]
!Acts 1:19-22
19 Errõl Jeruzsálem minden lakója tudomást szerzett, úgyhogy azt a telket az õ nevükön Hakeldamának, azaz vérmezõnek nevezték el. 
20 Benne van ugyanis a zsoltárok könyvében: Lakóhelyük váljék sivataggá, ne lakja senki sátrukat. És: Tisztségét kapja meg más. 
21 Kell tehát, hogy azok közül, akik mindig velünk tartottak, amikor a mi Urunk, Jézus közöttünk járt-kelt, 
22 kezdve János keresztségétõl egészen mennybevétele napjáig, valaki velünk együtt tanúskodjék feltámadásáról." 

[Lectio3]
!Acts 1:23-26
23 Kijelöltek hát kettõt, Józsefet, akit Barszabbásznak vagy más néven Jusztusznak is hívtak, és Mátyást. 
24 Majd imádkoztak: "Uram, ki belelátsz mindenkinek a szívébe, mutasd meg, e kettõ közül kire esik választásod, 
25 hogy átvegye az apostoli szolgálatban azt a helyet, amelyet Júdás hûtlenül elhagyott, hogy az õt megilletõ helyre jusson." 
26 Ezután sorsot vetettek. A sors Mátyásra esett, így a tizenegy apostolhoz sorolták.

From the Exposition of the Eighty-sixth Psalm by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
Her foundation is in the holy mountains the Lord loveth the gates of Zion.~
Wherefore hath the city twelve foundations, and in them the names of the~
Prophets and of the Apostles of the Lamb? Because their authority is the~
foundation whereon our weakness resteth. Wherefore are they the gates? Because~
through them we enter in unto the kingdom of God, since they have preached the~
same unto us, and when we enter in through their preaching, we enter in by~
Christ, Who is Himself The Door. (John x. 7.) And, whereas it is written that~
the city hath twelve gates, and, again, that Christ is the one Door, Christ is~
all the twelve, for He is in all the twelve and therefore were twelve Apostles~
chosen. There lieth a great mystery in the signification of this number twelve: Ye shall sit, said the Lord upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

[Lectio5]
If then there be set there twelve thrones of judgment, (Ps. cxxi. 5,) Paul, in~
that he is the thirteenth Apostle, hath not where to sit, nor wherein to judge.~
Nevertheless, he hath said of himself that he will judge not men only, but~
angels. Know ye not, saith he, that we shall judge angels? (i Cor. vi. 3,) that~
is, the fallen angels. Then might they have answered him Wherefore boastest~
thou thyself to be a judge? For where is thy seat? The Lord hath said that for~
the twelve Apostles there shall be twelve thrones one of the twelve, even~
Judas, is indeed fallen, but holy Matthias is chosen into his place; for the~
twelve thrones there are still twelve to sit thereon first find whereon thou~
shalt sit, and afterward give thyself out for a judge. Let us see, then, what is~
the meaning of these twelve thrones. By them is signified in a mystery the whole~
world, since the Church shall be through all the earth, whence this building is~
called to be built up together in Christ.

[Lectio6]
Therefore is it said that there shall be twelve thrones, because from all~
quarters shall there come men to be judged; even as it is said that the city~
hath twelve gates, because from all quarters shall the nations of them which are~
saved, enter into it. So, not the twelve only, and the Apostle Paul, but all, as~
many as shall judge, have part in these twelve thrones, this signifying, that~
they shall judge all men; even as all that enter into the city, have part in her~
twelve gates. For there are four quarters of the world, the East, and the West,~
and the North, and the South of which four quarters is mention often made in~
the Scriptures. From the four winds shall the elect be gathered together, as~
saith the Lord in the Gospel And He shall send His Angels with a great sound~
of a trumpet; and they shall gather together His elect from the four winds, from~
one end of heaven to the other. (Matth. xxiv. 31.) From the four winds,~
therefore, is the Church called together; and how are they called? Everywhere~
are they called in the Trinity; for they are called no otherwise than by~
baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.~
~(Matth. xxvii. 19.) Now four being multiplied by three is twelve.

Evangélium Szent Máté könyvébõl
!Matt 11:25-30
 Abban az idõben Jézus ezeket mondta: "Dicsõítelek, Atyám, ég és föld Ura, hogy az okosak és a bölcsek elõl elrejtetted ezeket és a kicsinyeknek kinyilatkoztattad. És így tovább.

Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!10th Sermon on the Words of the Lord?
 Come unto Me, all ye that labour! And wherefore labour we

all, but because we are frail, sickly, dying creatures, burdened with earthen~
vessels which distress us? But if these fleshly vessels be distressful, let the~
open expanse of love be free and wide. Come unto Me, all ye that labour! and~
why? That we may labour no more. His promise is an instant promise, for He~
calleth such as are labouring. Perchance they will ask Him what shall be their~
reward? And I, saith He, will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of~
Me not how to make the world, not how to create all things visible and invisible,~
not to work wonders in the earth, nor to raise the dead but for I am meek and~
lowly in heart.

[Lectio8]
Wilt thou be great? Begin by being little. Dost thou think to raise up a lofty~
building? Then lay the foundations thereof in lowliness. The greater soever, and~
the more massy, be that which any man thinketh to build, so much the deeper doth~
he dig his foundation. And when the house is built, it towereth heavenward; but~
he which layeth the foundation goeth down into the earth. The building,~
therefore, is low before it is high, and, after it is low, it riseth high to the~
roof.

[Lectio9]
What is the roof of the house on which we labour? Whither do its spires rise? I~
answer you at once; to the presence of God. You see how high it is, yea, what it~
is to see God. He that will, understandeth what I say, and he heareth. What is~
promised you is to see God, God, the True, God, the Supreme. Blessed is he who~
seeth Him by Whom he is seen. Such as worship false gods see them easily, but~
they see them who have eyes and see not. But unto us it is promised that we~
shall see that God Who liveth and seeth. (Gen. xvi. 14.)
