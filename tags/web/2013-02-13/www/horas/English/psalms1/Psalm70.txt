70:1 In thee, O Lord, I have hoped, let me never be put to confusion: * deliver me in thy justice, and rescue me.
70:2 Incline thy ear unto me, * and save me.
70:3 Be thou unto me a God, a protector, and a place of strength: * that thou mayst make me safe.
70:4 For thou art my firmament * and my refuge.
70:5 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the sinner, * and out of the hand of the transgressor of the law and of the unjust.
70:6 For thou art my patience, O Lord: * my hope, O Lord, from my youth.
70:7 By thee have I been confirmed from the womb: * from my mother’s womb thou art my protector.
70:8 Of thee shall I continually sing: * I am become unto many as a wonder, but thou art a strong helper.
70:9 Let my mouth be filled with praise, that I may sing thy glory; * thy greatness all the day long.
70:10 Cast me not off in the time of old age: * when my strength shall fail, do not thou forsake me.
70:11 For my enemies have spoken against me; * and they that watched my soul have consulted together,
70:12 Saying: God hath forsaken him: pursue and take him, * for there is none to deliver him.
70:12 O God, be not thou far from me: * O my God, make haste to my help.
70:13 Let them be confounded and come to nothing that detract my soul; * let them be covered with confusion and shame that seek my hurt.
70:14 But I will always hope; * and will add to all thy praise.
70:15 My mouth shall shew forth thy justice; * thy salvation all the day long.
70:16 Because I have not known learning, I will enter into the powers of the Lord: * O Lord, I will be mindful of thy justice alone.
70:17 Thou hast taught me, O God, from my youth: * and till now I will declare thy wonderful works.
70:18 And unto old age and grey hairs: * O God, forsake me not,
70:19 Until I shew forth thy arm * to all the generation that is to come:
70:20 Thy power, and thy justice, O God, even to the highest great things thou hast done: * O God, who is like to thee?
70:21 How great troubles hast thou shewn me, many and grievous: and turning thou hast brought me to life, * and hast brought me back again from the depths of the earth:
70:22 Thou hast multiplied thy magnificence; * and turning to me thou hast comforted me.
70:23 For I will also confess to thee thy truth with the instruments of psaltery: * O God, I will sing to thee with the harp,
70:24 My lips shall greatly rejoice, when I shall sing to thee; * and my soul which thou hast redeemed. 
70:24 Yea and my tongue shall meditate on thy justice all the day; * when they shall be confounded and put to shame that seek evils to me.
