Lesson from the book of Proverbs
!Prov 16:1-5
1 It is the part of man to prepare the soul: and of the Lord to govern the tongue.
2 All the ways of a man are open to his eyes: the Lord is the weigher of spirits.
3 Lay open thy works to the Lord: and thy thoughts shall be directed.
4 The Lord hath made all things for himself: the wicked also for the evil day.
5 Every proud man is an abomination to the Lord: though hand should be joined to hand, he is not innocent.

!Prov 16:5-9
5 The beginning of a good way is to do justice; and this is more acceptable with God, than to offer sacrifices.
6 By mercy and truth iniquity is redeemed: and by the fear of the Lord men depart from evil.
7 When the ways of man shall please the Lord, he will convert even his enemies to peace.
8 Better is a little with justice, than great revenues with iniquity.
9 The heart of man disposeth his way: but the Lord must direct his steps.

!Prov 16:10-15
10 Divination is in the lips of the king, his mouth shall not err in judgment.
11 Weight and balance are judgments of the Lord: and his work all the weights of the bag.
12 They that act wickedly are abominable to the king: for the throne is established by justice.
13 Just lips are the delight of kings: he that speaketh right things shall be loved.
14 The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: and the wise man will pacify it.
15 In the cheerfulness of the king's countenance is life: and his clemency is like the latter rain.
