99:1 Sing joyfully to God, all the earth: * serve ye the Lord with gladness.
99:2 Come in before his presence * with exceeding great joy.
99:3 Know ye that the Lord he is God: * he made us, and not we ourselves.
99:4 We are his people and the sheep of his pasture. * Go ye into his gates with praise, into his courts with hymns: and give glory to him.
99:5 Praise ye his name: for the Lord is sweet, his mercy endureth for ever, * and his truth to generation and generation.
