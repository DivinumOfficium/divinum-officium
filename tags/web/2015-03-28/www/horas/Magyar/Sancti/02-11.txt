O God who by the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin didst prepare a worthy dwelling place for thy Son, we humbly beseech the that we, who celebrate the apparence of the same Virgin, may obtain health of soul and body
$Per eumdem

[Invit]
Let us celebrate the Immaculate Conception ofthe Virgin Mary: * Let us adore the Lord Christ her Son.

[Hymnus Matutinum]
v. Thee would we hymn, O spotless one,
Blest Mother of a virgin Son,
And as we chant thy praises meet,
Do thou for us God's grace entreat.
_
Poor Adam's guilty heirs are we,
His sin-infected progeny;
But thou, for Christ's sake, we believe,
From sins' infection hadst reprieve.
_
Thus, boast of mankind, free from sin
In thy so glorious origin,
The envious dragon, 'neath thy heel,
On his crushed head Christ's might doth feel.
_
O flower of the human race,
Who took'st away poor Eve's disgrace,
Obtain for every wavering one
To serve without reproach thy Son.
_
When that old serpent would beguile
Our foolish hearts with sinful wile,
Gain us the might to smite him down
And win the blessed victor's crown.
_
* All honour, laud, and glory be,
O Jesu, Virgin-born, to thee,
Whom with the Father we adore,
And Holy Ghost, for evermore.  
Amen.

!Prov 8:12-17
12 "Nekem, a bölcsességnek birtokomban van az eszesség, én találtam fel az~
éleslátás tudományát.
14 Az én tulajdonom a jó tanács és a siker, enyém az okosság és enyém a~

[Lectio4]
In the fourth year from the dogmatic definition of the immaculate Conception of the blessed Virgin, at the bank of the river Gave near the town of Lourdes of the diocese of Tarbes in France, the Virgin herself in a bend of the rock above the grotto of Massabiele, often shewed herself to a certain girl, called in the vernacular tongue Bernadette, indeed most poor but noble and pious, to be seen. The immaculate Virgin appeared with a young and kind appearance, clothed with a white garment and white veil, and girt with a blue girdle; she adorned her bare feet with a golden rose. On the first day of the apparition, which was the eleventh of February in the one thousand eight hundred fifty-eighth year, she taught the girl the sign of the cross to be duly and piously made, and she incited her, by her example, to the recitation of the sacred rosary, turning over with her hand the chaplet, which before was hanging down from her arm: which she supplied also in the other apparitions. And on the second day of the apparition, the girl in the simplicity of her heart, fearing diabolic fraud, flung holy water on the Virgin; but the blessed Virgin, smiling gently, shewed her face more kindly to her. And when she appeared a third time, she invited the girl to the grotto for fifteen days. Thence she often addressed her; then commanded, that it might be declared to the priests, a chapel to be built there, and to be approached there for supplications in a manner of solemnity. Moreover she commanded that from the spring, which thus far was hidden under the sand but now was about to erupt, she might drink the water, and by it cleanse herself. Finally on the feast day of the Annunciation, to the girl earnestly inquiring her name, the Virgin, for whose appearance she was so often deemed worthy, the Virgin, her hands having been moved to her breast and her eyes raised to heaven, answered: I am the Immaculate Conception.

[Responsory4]
R. Who is she, that cometh forth as the morning rising, 
* Fair as the moon, bright as the sun? 
V. She is my dove, my perfect one, my undefiled. Fair.
R. Fair as the moon, bright as the sun?

[Lectio5]
The fame of favours becoming widespread, which the faithful were said to have received in the sacred grotto, in time the assembly of men increased, whom the sanctity of the place called to the grotto. Therefore the bishop of Tarbes moved by the fame of the wonders and the purity of the girl, after a juridical inquiry of the happenings, approved by his decree the signs of the apparition to be supernatural, and permitted the worship of the immaculate Virgin in the same grotto. Soon a chapel is built: from that day the almost innumerable crowds of the faithful, for the purpose of of prayer and supplication, from France, Belgium, Italy, Spain, and the other provinces of Europe and also from the remote regions of America arrived there in every year, and the name of the Immaculate of Lourdes becometh famous of countries everywhere. The water of the spring, having been carried into all parts of the world, restored health to the sick. And the Catholic world mindful of such great favours, built holy shrines there with wonderful work. Innumerable banners, as if monuments of received benefits, sent there by cities and nations, decorate the shrine of the Virgin with wonderful adornment. In this as if her own seat the immaculate Virgin is continually honoured: indeed by day with prayers, religious chant and other solemn ceremonies; and by night with those solemn supplications, by which the almost infinite crowds of pilgrims proceed with candles and lit torches and sing the praises of the blessed Virgin.

[Responsory5]
R. In the last days the mountain a house for the Virgin Mary shall be prepared on the top of mountains, and it shall be exalted above the heavens, and many people shall go and say: 
* Come and let us go up to the mountain. 
V. The dwelling in thee is as it were of all rejoicing. 
R. Come and let us go up to the mountain.

[Lectio6]
It is known by all for certain the pilgrimages of this sort to have stirred up faith, in a world becoming cold, the soul to have increased to profess the Christian law, and to have spread the worship of the immaculate Virgin in a wonderful manner. In which wonderful profession of faith the Christian people have the priests as leaders, who lead their people thence. The holy Bishops themselves also frequently visit the holy place, lead pilgrimages, and take part in more solemn feasts. Nor indeed is it rare to observe these empurpled fathers of the Roman Church approaching humble in the manner of pilgrims. Even these Roman Pontiffs, for their piety towards the Immaculate of Lourdes, enhanced the sacred shrine with most noble gifts. Pius the ninth, with sacred indulgences, distinguished it with the privilege of an archconfraternity and title of a minor Basilica; and willed the image honoured there of the Godbearer, with solemn rite through his apostolic legate in France, to be adorned with a crown. And Leo the thirteenth also conferred innumerable benefits, granted indulgences in the manner of a jubilee in the twenty-fifth year of the Apparition occurring, promoted pilgrimages by his authority and word, and arranged to complete by his name the solemn dedication of the Church under the title of the Rosary. He accumulated the extent of which benefits, when, with the asking of many bishops, he kindly granted a solemn feast to be celebrated under the title of the Apparition of the blessed Virgin Mary immaculate with a proper Office and proper Mass. Finally supreme Pontiff Pius the tenth for his piety towards the Godbearer, and agreeing to the wishes of many holy Bishops, extended the same feast to the universal Church.

[Responsory6]
R. Thou hast prevented her, O Lord, with blessings of sweetness, thou hast set on her head 
* A crown of precious stones. 
V. Her glory is great in thy salvation, glory and great beauty shalt thou lay upon her. 
R. A crown of precious stones. 
&Gloria
R. A crown of precious stones.

v. O rosy dawn! that dost proclaim
Salvations happy day,
To thee, O Virgin, mid nights shades,
Thy people humbly pray.
_
The torrent, that engulfs all those
Within this whirlpool drawn,
Rests calm as oer its softened wave
The ark of God borne
_
While earth is parched with scorching
heat,
Alone art thou bedewed;
With dew oerspread the earth around,
And thou untouched art viewd
_
The serpent rears his head aloft
Disgorging poisoned spleen;
But thou his proud, inflated head
Dost crush with powr as Queen.
_
O loving Mother, hear our prayr,
As suppliant we cry;
Protect us in our strife with hell
Who dost its power defy.
_
O Jesu, born of Virgin bright,
All glory be to thee,
With Father and with Paraclete,
Through all eternity.
Amen.

Her form in beauty fair,

Her sacred lips declare.

O hallowd rock, whence spring
The living waters of a gushing stream,
The gifts of life to bring..

And thither from the farmost bounds of earth
The pilgrims wend their way,
And suppliant around the Virgins shrine
Her powerful help they pray.

And grants the longed-for grace;
And health restored, the pilgrim throng returns
Unto its native place.
_
O Virgin! have compassion on our needs,
Refresh us labouring on;
Obtain for us the joys of heavenly life,
When sorrow all is gone.

All praise and honour to the Father be,
And to his only Son,
And to the Spirit, Powr of both for aye,
In Godhead ever One.
