Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Romans
!Rom 13:8-10
Brethren: Owe no man anything except to love on another; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the Law. For You shall not commit adultery. You shall not kill. You shall not steal. You shall not bear false witness. You shall not covet; and if there is any other commandment, it is summed up in this saying, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. Love does no evil to a neighbor. Love therefore is the fulfillment of the law.

Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 8:23-27
At that time, Jesus got into a boat, and His disciples followed Him. And behold,~
there arose a great storm on the sea, so that the boat was covered by the waves;~
but He was asleep. So they came and woke Him, saying, Lord save us! we are~
perishing! But He said to them, Why are you fearful, O you of little faith? Then~
He arose and rebuked the wind and the sea, and there came a great calm. And the~
men marveled, saying, What manner of Man is this, that even the wind and the sea~
obey Him?
