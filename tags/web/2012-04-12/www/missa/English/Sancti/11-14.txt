Martyr and Bishop, was filled when he laid down his life for his flock; so that,~

[Lectio]
Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Jews
!Heb 5:1-6
Brethren: For every high priest taken from among men is appointed for men in the things pertaining to God, that he may offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. He is able to have compassion on the ignorant and erring, because he himself also is beset with weakness, and by reason thereof is obliged to offer for sins, as on behalf of the people, so also for himself. And no man takes the honor to himself; he takes it who is called by God, as Aaron was. So also Christ did not glorify Himself with the high priesthood, but He Who spoke to Him, Thou are My Son, I this day have begotten Thee. As He says also in another place, Thou are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchisedech.

[Graduale]
!Ps 88:21-23
I have found David, My servant; with My holy oil I have anointed him, that My~
hand may be always with him, and that My arm may make him strong.
V. No enemy shall deceived him, nor shall the wicked afflict him. Alleluia,~
alleluia.
V. This is the priest who the Lord has crowned. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 10:11-16
 At that time, Jesus said to the Pharisees: I am the Good Shepherd. The good~
shepherd lays down his life for his sheep. But the hireling, who is not a~
shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep~
and flees. And the wolf snatches and scatters the sheep; but the hireling flees~
because he is a hireling, and has no concern for the sheep. I am the Good~
Shepherd, and I know Mine and Mine know Me, even as the Father knows Me and I~
know the Father; and I lay down My life for My sheep. And other sheep I have~
that are not of this fold. Them also I must bring, and they shall hear My voice,~
and there shall be one fold and one Shepherd.

[Offertorium]
!John 15:13
Greater love than this no one has, that one lay down his life for his friends.

[Secreta]
Most merciful God, shower these offerings with Your blessing and strengthen us~
in the faith which St. Josaphat, Your Martyr and Bishop, upheld by the shedding~
of his blood.

!John 10:14

victory for the honor of Your Church.
