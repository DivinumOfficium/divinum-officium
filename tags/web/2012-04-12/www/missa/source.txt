This programlet is an attempt to collect the text of the daily masses of the different ages.<BR>
It is not Liturgical text, nor documentative nor formational material, the simple reason is to
 show how the changes during the time, and may be as devotional help for those who cannot
 attend daily masses. <BR>
I used as source the 1920 missal from <A HREF="http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/missale-romanum-pdf.html" TARGET=_NEW"> sanctamissa.org</A> site
