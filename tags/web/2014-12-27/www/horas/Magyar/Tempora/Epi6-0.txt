Szent Pál Apostolol Zsidókhoz írt levelének kezdete
!Heb 1:1-4
1 Sokszor és sokféle módon szólt Isten hajdan az atyákhoz,
2 ezekben a végső napokban Fiában szólt hozzánk, akit a mindenség örökösévé tett,~
aki által az időket is teremtette.
3 Mint dicsőségének kisugárzása és lényegének képmása, ő tartja fenn hathatós~
szavával a mindenséget. A bűntől való megtisztítást elvégezve helyet foglalt az~
isteni Fölség jobbján,
4 s annyival kiválóbb, mint az angyalok, amennyivel különb nevet örökölt náluk.

!Heb 1:5-9
5 Vajon melyik angyalnak mondta valaha: "A fiam vagy, ma szültelek?" Vagy: "Én~
atyja leszek, ő meg a fiam."
6 Ám amikor Elsőszülöttét bevezeti a világba, ezt mondja: "Imádja őt Isten~
minden angyala."
7 Az angyalokról így beszél: Aki követeit szelekké teszi, és szolgáit~
tűzlángokká.
8 A Fiához ellenben e szavakkal fordul: Isten, trónod áll örökre, királyi pálcád~
igazságosság vesszője.
9 Az igazságot szereted, a gonoszságot gyűlölöd, azért kent föl Isten, a te~
Istened, a vigasság olajával minden társad felett.

!Heb 1:10-14
10 Továbbá: Kezdetben, Uram, te teremtetted a földet, az ég is a te kezed~
munkája.
11 Ezek elmúlnak, de te nem múlsz el soha, mindenek elavulnak, mint valami ruha.
12 Akár a köntöst, úgy göngyölöd össze őket, s mint a ruha, úgy változnak meg.~
Ám te ugyanaz vagy, és esztendeid nem érnek véget.
13 Ugyan melyik angyalnak mondta valaha: Jobbom felől foglalj helyet, és lábad~
alá teszem zsámolyul minden ellenségedet?
14 Nemde ők mind szolgáló lelkek? Azok szolgálatára vannak küldve, akik majd~
öröklik az üdvösséget.

[Lectio4]
From the Sermons of St Athanasius, Pope (of Alexandria. )
!2 nd against the Arians.
If the heretics had but known the person, the matter, and the times of the~
Apostle who spoke, they would never have spoken of Godhead as if It were human,~
nor borne themselves so wickedly, and withal so foolishly against Christ. It~
will be permitted to us to return, and to take again the first words of the~
Lesson. The Apostle then saith God, Who at sundry times and in divers manners,~
spake in time past unto the fathers by the Prophets, hath in these last days~
spoken unto us by His Son and again, a little farther on: When the Son had~
purged our sins, He sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high being made~
so much better than the angels as He hath by inheritance obtained a more~
excellent name than they. The Apostle here expressly nameth the times wherein~
God hath spoken unto us by His Son, and wherein the Same His Son hath purged our~
sins; for when hath He spoken unto us by His Son, when did the Son purge our~
sins, or when was He born a Man, but since God spake unto the Fathers by the~
Prophets, namely, in these last days?

[Responsory4]

[Lectio5]
The Apostle, about to enter on the subject of the Word's human dispensation and~
the last days, naturally mentioneth first that God had not up to those days been~
silent, but had spoken unto the fathers by the Prophets and, after the Prophets~
had discharged their office, and the law had been given by the ministry of~
angels, that the Son also came down unto us to minister and then he addeth,~
being made so much better than the angels, to show that as the Son differeth~
from a servant, so is the ministry of the Son better than the duty and office of~
servants.

[Lectio6]
The Apostle, therefore, seeing the difference between the new ministry and the~
old, maketh very bold in writing and speaking to the Jews. For this cause,~
therefore, he doth not compare the details of the two ministries, and then come~
to the general conclusion that the new was greater or more honourable than the~
old, (lest any should understand that the two ministries were of the same kind,~
and that the conclusion that the new is better is arrived at by comparing the~
degrees in each of things which they had in common,) but he saith that the Son~
was made better, to distinguish at once and completely the nature of the Son~
from the nature of things created.

Evangélium szent Máté könyvéből
!Matt 13:31-32
Azon időben Jézus egy másik példabeszédet is mondott nekik: "A mennyek országa~
hasonlít a mustármaghoz, amelyet fogott a gazda és elvetett földjében. És így~
tovább.
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Book ii. Comment, on Matth. xiii.
The kingdom of heaven is the proclamation of the Gospel, and that knowledge of~
the Scriptures, which leadeth unto life, and whereof it is said to the Jews, The~
kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the~
fruits thereof. (Matth. xxi. 43-) Therefore is this kingdom like to a grain of~
mustard - seed, which a man took and sowed in his field. By the man that sowed~
it in his field, many understand to be meant the Saviour, because He is the~
Sower That soweth in the souls of believers; others understand every man that~
soweth good seed in his own field, that is, in himself and in his own heart.

[Responsory7]
@Tempora/Epi2-0:Responsory7

[Lectio8]
Who is he that soweth, but our own mind and soul, which take the grain from~
preaching, and by nourishing it in the soil, cause it to sprout in the field of~
our own breast? The preaching of the Gospel is the least of all doctrines. He~
that preacheth, for his first lesson, God made man, Christ dead, and the~
stumbling-block of the Cross, receiveth at first but little credit. Compare such~
teaching as this with the doctrines of the Philosophers, with their books, their~
magnificent eloquence, and their rounded sentences, and thou shalt see how the~
grain of the Gospel, when it is sown, is the humblest of all seeds.

[Responsory8]
@Tempora/Pent01-0:Responsory8

[Lectio9]
But when the doctrines of men grow up, there is therein nothing piercing,~
nothing healthy, nothing life-giving. The plant is drooping, and delicate, and~
soft. There are herbs and grass whereof it may truly be said that the grass~
withereth and the flower fadeth. (Isa. xl. 8.) But the grain of Gospel seed,~
though, when it was sown, it seemed to be the least of all seeds, when once it~
is rooted in the soul of man, or in the whole world, groweth not into an herb,~
but becometh a tree so that the birds of the air (whereby we may understand,~
either the souls of believers, or the (angelic) powers bound to the service of~
God,) come and lodge in the branches thereof. I consider that the branches of~
the Gospel tree, which groweth from the grain of mustard - seed, are the divers~
developments of doctrine, on which the birds above mentioned find~
resting-places.
&teDeum

[Versum 2]
V. The Lord reigneth He is clothed with majesty.
R. The Lord is clothed with strength, and has girded Himself with power.

[Ant 2]
The kingdom of heaven * is like to a grain of mustard-seed, which is the least~
of all seeds, but, when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs.

[Versum 3]
V. Uram, legyen imádságom
R. Illatáldozat szined előtt.

[Ant 3]
The kingdom of heaven * is like unto leaven, which a woman took and hid in three~
measures of meal till the whole was leavened.
