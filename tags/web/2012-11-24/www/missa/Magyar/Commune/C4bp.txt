Olvasmány szent Péter apostol elsõ levelébõl
!1 Pet 5:1-4; 5:10-11.
Dearly beloved brethren: The ancients therefore that are among you, I beseech, who am myself also an ancient, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ: as also a partaker of that glory which is to be revealed in time to come: Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking care of it, not by constraint, but willingly, according to God: not for filthy lucrés sake, but voluntarily: Neither as lording it over the clergy, but being made a pattern of the flock from the heart. And when the prince of pastors shall appear, you shall receive a never fading crown of glory. But the God of all grace, who hath called us into his eternal glory in Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little, will himself perfect you, and confirm you, and establish you. To him be glory and empire for ever and ever. Amen.

[Evangelium]
Evangélium + szent Máté Apostol kõnyvébõl
!Matt 16:13-19
v. Amikor Jézus Fülöp Cezáreájának vidékére ért, megkérdezte tanítványaitól: "Kinek tartják az emberek az Emberfiát?"  Így válaszoltak: "Van, aki Keresztelõ Jánosnak, van, aki Illésnek, Jeremiásnak vagy valamelyik másik prófétának."  Jézus most hozzájuk fordult: "Hát ti mit mondtok, ki vagyok?"  Simon Péter válaszolt: "Te vagy Krisztus, az élõ Isten Fia."  Erre Jézus azt mondta neki: "Boldog vagy, Simon, Jónás fia, mert nem a test és vér nyilatkoztatta ki ezt neked, hanem az én mennyei Atyám.  Én is mondom neked: Péter vagy, erre a sziklára építem egyházamat, s az alvilág kapui sem vesznek rajta erõt.  Neked adom a mennyek országa kulcsait. Amit megkötsz a földön, a mennyben is meg lesz kötve, s amit feloldasz a földön, a mennyben is fel lesz oldva."
