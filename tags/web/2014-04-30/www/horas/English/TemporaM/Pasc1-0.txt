Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Colossenses
!Col 3:1-7
1 Therefore, if you be risen with Christ, seek the things that are above; where~
Christ is sitting at the right hand of God:
2 Mind the things that are above, not the things that are upon the earth.
3 For you are dead; and your life is hid with Christ in God.
4 When Christ shall appear, who is your life, then you also shall appear with~
him in glory.
5 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication,~
uncleanness, lust, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is the service of~
idols.
6 For which things the wrath of God cometh upon the children of unbelief,
7 In which you also walked some time, when you lived in them.

!Col 3:8-13
8 But now put you also all away: anger, indignation, malice, blasphemy, filthy~
speech out of your mouth.
9 Lie not one to another: stripping yourselves of the old man with his deeds,
10 And putting on the new, him who is renewed unto knowledge, according to the~
image of him that created him.
11 Where there is neither Gentile nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision,~
Barbarian nor Scythian, bond nor free. But Christ is all, and in all.
12 Put ye on therefore, as the elect of God, holy, and beloved, the bowels of~
mercy, benignity, humility, modesty, patience:
13 Bearing with one another, and forgiving one another, if any have a complaint~
against another: even as the Lord hath forgiven you, so do you also

[Responsory2]
R. The Angel of the Lord spake unto the woman, saying : Whom seek ye? Seek ye~

!Col 3:14-17
14 But above all these things have charity, which is the bond of perfection:
15 And let the peace of Christ rejoice in your hearts, wherein also you are~
called in one body: and be ye thankful.
16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you abundantly, in all wisdom: teaching and~
admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual canticles, singing in~
grace in your hearts to God.
17 All whatsoever you do in word or in work, do all in the name of the Lord~
Jesus Christ, giving thanks to God and the Father by him

From the Sermons of St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!1st Sermon for the Octave of the Passover, being the 157th for the Seasons.
The Feast of this day is the end of the Paschal solemnity, and therefore it is~
to-day that the Newly-Baptized put off their white garments : but, though they~
lay aside the outward mark of washing in their raiment, the mark of that washing~
in their souls remaineth to eternity. Now are the days of the Pass-over, that is,~
of God's Passing-over our iniquity by His pardon and remission; and therefore~
our first duty is so to sanctify the mirth of these holy days, that our bodily~
recreation may be taken without defilement to our spiritual cleanness. Let us~
strive that our relaxation may be sober and our freedom holy, holding ourselves~
carefully aloof from anything like excess, drunkenness or lechery. Let us try so~
to keep in our souls their Lenten cleansing, that if our Fasting hath left us~
aught yet unwon, we may still be able to seek it.

At discourse concerneth all them which are committed unto my spiritual charge;~
but, nevertheless, since the first happy week of your Sacramental life draweth~
this day to a close, I address myself in especial to you who are the new~
olive-plants of holiness round about the Table of the Lord, (Ps. cxxvii. 4,) to~
you, who have but a little while been born again of water and the Holy Ghost,~
~(John iii. 5,) to you, O holy generation (1 Pet. ii. 9) to you, O new creation,~
~(Gal. vi. 15,) to you, the excellency of my dignity, (Gen. xlix. 3,) and the~
fruit of my labour, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and my~
crown, all ye who now stand so fast in the Lord. (Phil. iv. i.) To you I address~
the words of the Apostle (Rom. xiii. 12.) Behold! the night is past! the day is~
come! Cast off therefore the works of darkness, and put on the armour of light.~
Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in~
chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying : but put ye on the Lord~
Jesus Christ.

We have, saith Peter, (2 Peter i. 19,) a more sure word of Prophecy, whereunto~
ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place,~
until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts. Let your loins~
therefore be girded about, and your lights burning in your hands, and ye~
yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the~
wedding. (Luke xii. 36.) Behold, the days come, whereof the Lord saith, (John~
xvi. 16, 17, 19,) A little while, and ye shall not see Me, and again a little~
while and ye shall see Me. No\ is the hour whereof He said (20), Ye shall weep~
and lament, but the work shall rejoice that is to say, this present life,~
wherein we walk as strangers and pilgrims, (1 Pet. ii. 11,) far away from Him~
Who is our Home, this present life is very full of trials. But, saith Jesus, u~
but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man~
taketh from you. (22.)

From the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 20:19-31
In that time: Now when it was late that same day, the first of the week, and the~
doors were shut, where the disciples were gathered together, for fear of the~
Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them: Peace be to you. And~
so on
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great.)
!26th on the Gospels.
When we hear this passage of the Gospel read, a question straightway knocketh at~
the door of our mind. How was it that the Body of the Risen Lord was a real Body,~
if It was able to pass through closed doors into the assembly of His disciples?~
But we ought to know that the works of God are no more wonderful when they can~
be understood by man's reason, and faith has lost her worth when her~
subject-matter is the subject-matter of human demonstration. Nevertheless, those~
very works of our Redeemer which are in themselves impossible to be understood,~
must be thought over in connection with other of His works, that we may be led~
to believe in things wonderful, by mean of things more wonderful still. That~
Body of the Lord, Which came into the assembly of the disciples through closed~
doors, was the Same, Which at Its birth, had become manifest to the eyes of men~
by passing out of the cloister of- the Virgin's womb without breaking the seal~
thereof. What wonder is it if that Body Which had come out of the Virgin's womb,~
without opening the matrix, albeit It was then on Its way to die, now that It~
was risen again from the dead and instinct for ever with undying life, what~
wonder is it, I say, if that Body passed through closed doors?

[Lectio8]
But since the beholders doubted of the reality of that Body Which they saw, He~
showed unto them His Hands and His Side, and allowed them to handle that Same~
Flesh Which had just passed through the closed doors. (Luke xxiv. 39.) In this~
there were two strange things manifested, yea, things which according to our~
understanding are contrary the one to the other. His Risen Body was~
incorruptible and yet palpable. For whatever can be touched, must needs be~
subject to corruption; and whatever is not subject to corruption, cannot be~
touched. But, in a way altogether wonderful and incomprehensible, our Redeemer~
after His Resurrection revealed Himself in a Body at once palpable and~
incorruptible : revealed Himself in an incorruptible Body, that we might learn~
to seek a like glorification; and in a palpable Body, for the strengthening of~
our faith. He revealed Himself in a Body at once incorruptible and palpable,~
that He might thereby make manifest the fact that His Risen Body was unaltered~
in nature, albeit transfigured in glory.

[Lectio9]
Then said Jesus to them again : Peace be unto you. As My Father hath sent Me,~
even so send I you  that is, as My Father, Who is God, hath sent Me, Who am God,~
even so do I, Who am Man, send you, who are men. The Father sent the Son, Whom~
He appointed to be made Man for the redemption of man. Him He willed to send~
into the world to suffer, albeit He Whom He sent to suffer was the Son of His~
love. The Lord sendeth His chosen Apostles into the world, not to be happy in~
the world, but, as He had been Himself sent, to suffer. As the Father loveth the~
Son and yet sendeth Him to suffer, even so doth the Lord love His disciples,~
albeit He sendeth them into the world, to suffer therein; and therefore it is~
well said: As My Father hath sent Me, even so send I you  that is, while I send~
you into the wild storm of persecution, I love you all the same, I love you, yea, I~
love you with a love like that wherewith the Father loveth Me, Who sent Me into~
the world to bear agony therein.

Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 20:19-31
20:19 Now when it was late that same day, the first of the week, and the doors were shut, where the disciples were gathered together, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them: Peace be to you.
20:20 And when he had said this, he shewed them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad, when they saw the Lord.
20:21 He said therefore to them again: Peace be to you. As the Father hath sent me, I also send you.
20:22 When he had said this, he breathed on them; and he said to them: Receive ye the Holy Ghost.
20:23 Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained.
20:24 Now Thomas, one of the twelve, who is called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.
20:25 The other disciples therefore said to him: We have seen the Lord. But he said to them: Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.
20:26 And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Jesus cometh, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said: Peace be to you.
20:27 Then he saith to Thomas: Put in thy finger hither, and see my hands; and bring hither thy hand, and put it into my side; and be not faithless, but believing.
20:28 Thomas answered, and said to him: My Lord, and my God.
20:29 Jesus saith to him: Because thou hast seen me, Thomas, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and have believed.
20:30 Many other signs also did Jesus in the sight of his disciples, which are not written in this book.
20:31 But these are written, that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God: and that believing, you may have life in his name.
