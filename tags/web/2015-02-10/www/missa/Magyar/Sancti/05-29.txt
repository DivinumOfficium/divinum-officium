!2 Cor 10:17-18; 11:1-2
v. De "aki dicsekszik, az Úrban dicsekedjék."  Nem az a megbízható, aki magát ajánlja, hanem akit az Úr ajánl.  Bárcsak eltűrnétek részemről egy kis balgaságot!  De hiszen meg is teszitek. Én Isten féltékenységével féltelek titeket. Mert eljegyeztelek benneteket egy férfival, hogy tiszta szűzként vezesselek el Krisztushoz.
