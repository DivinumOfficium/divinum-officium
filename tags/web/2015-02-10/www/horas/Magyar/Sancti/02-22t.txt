[Ant Vespera]
Behold an high priest, * who in his days pleased God, and was found righteous the kingdom of God;;109
None was found like unto him, * to keep the Law of the Most High;;110
Therefore the Lord assured him * by an oath that He would multiply his seed among His people;;111
O all ye Priests of God, * bless ye the Lord O all ye servants of the Lord, sing praises unto our God;;112
Good and faithful servant, * enter thou into the joy of thy Lord

[Hymnus Vespera]
Peter, whatever thou shalt bind on earth,
The same is bound above the starry sky;
What here thy delegated power doth loose,
Is loosed in heaven's suprenleit Court on high:
To judgment shalt thou come, when the world's end is nigh.
_
Praise to the Father, through all ages be;
Praise to the consubstantial sovereign Son,
And Holy Ghost, One glorious Trinity;
To whom all majesty and might belong;
So sing we now, and such be our eternal song.
Ámen.

[Versum 1]
V. The Lord loved him and beautified him.
R. He clothed him with a robe of glory.

[Ant 1]
Thou art the Shepherd * of the sheep, and the Prince of the Apostles, and unto~
thee are given the keys of the kingdom of heaven.

[Oratio]
v. O God, Who hast given unto thy Blessed Apostle Peter the keys of the kingdom~
of heaven, and the power to bind and to loose, loose us, we beseech thee, at his~
mighty intercession, from all the bands of our sins.

Olvasmány szent Péter apostol első leveléből
!1 Pet 1:1-5
1 Péter, Jézus Krisztus apostola a zarándokoknak, akik Pontusz, Galácia,~
Kappadócia, Ázsia és Bitinia területén szórványokban élnek, s akiket az
2 Atyaisten előretudása birtokában kiválasztott, a Lélek megszentelő erejéből az~
engedelmességre és a Jézus Krisztus vérével való meghintésre. Kegyelemben és~
békében bőven legyen részetek!
3 Legyen áldott az Isten és Urunk, Jézus Krisztus Atyja, aki minket nagy~
irgalmában Jézusnak a halálból való feltámadása által új életre hívott, az élő~
reményre,
4 hogy a mennyekben elpusztíthatatlan, tiszta és soha el nem hervadó örökség~
várjon rátok.
5 Az Isten hatalma megőrzött titeket a hitben az örök üdvösségre, amely készen~
áll, hogy az utolsó időben majd megnyilvánuljon.

[Responsory1]
R. Simon Peter, before I called thee out of the ship, I knew thee, and appointed~
thee for a ruler over My people.
* And I have given unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.
V. Whatsoever, thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and~
whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.
R. And I have given unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.

[Lectio2]
!1 Pet 1:6-9
6 Abban örülni fogtok, noha most egy kicsit szomorkodnotok kell, mert különféle~
kísértések érnek benneteket,
7 hogy a próbát kiállva hitetek, amely értékesebb a tűz próbálta veszendő~
aranynál, Jézus Krisztus megjelenésekor méltó legyen a dicséretre, a dicsőségre~
és a tiszteletre.
8 Akit noha nem láttatok, mégis szerettek; bár most sem látjátok, mégis hisztek~
benne. De mivel hisztek, ujjonghattok a megdicsőültek kimondhatatlan örömével,
9 mert eléritek hitetek célját: lelketek üdvösségét.

[Responsory2]
R. Simon Peter, if thou lovest Me, feed My sheep. Lord, Thou knowest that I love~
thee
* I will lay down my life for thy sake.
V. If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee.
R. I will lay down my life for thy sake.

!1 Pet 1:10-12
10 Ezt az üdvösséget keresték és kutatták a próféták, akik a nektek szánt~
kegyelemről jövendöltek.
11 Töprengtek rajta, vajon milyen időpontra vagy milyen korra mutat Krisztusnak~
bennük működő Lelke, előre megmondva a Krisztusra váró szenvedéseket és az~
azutáni dicsőséget.
12 Kinyilatkoztatást kaptak, hogy ne maguknak, hanem nektek legyenek~
szolgálatotokra azzal, amit az evangélium hirdetői most közöltek veletek az~
égből küldött Szentlélek erejéből. Ezekbe (az igazságokba) maguk az angyalok is~
csak vágynak bepillantani.

[Responsory3]
R. Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My Church, and the gates of~
hell shall not prevail against it.
* And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.
V. Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever~
thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.
R. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.
&Gloria
R. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.

From the Sermons of St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!16th on the Saints.
The solemn Feast of to-day received from our forefathers the name of that of St~
Peter's Chair at Antioch, because there is a tradition that it was on this day~
that Peter, first of the Apostles, was enthroned in a Bishop's Chair. Rightly,~
therefore, do the Churches observe the first day of that Chair, the right to~
which the Apostle received for the salvation of the Churches from the Lord of~
the Churches Himself, with the words Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will~
build My Church.It was the Lord Himself Who called Peter the foundation of the~
Church, and therefore it is right that the Church should reverence this~
foundation whereon her mighty structure riseth. Justly is it written in the~
Psalm which we have just heard Let them exalt him in the congregation of the~
people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders. Blessed be God, Who hath~
commanded that the Blessed Apostle Peter should be exalted in the congregation!~
Worthy to be honoured by the Church is that foundation from which her goodly~
towers rise, ascending to heaven!

[Responsory4]
R. Thou art the Shepherd of the sheep, and the Prince of the Apostles, and unto~
thee hath God given all the kingdoms of the world.
* Therefore unto thee hath He given the keys of the kingdom of heaven.
V. Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever~
thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
R. Therefore unto thee hath He given the keys of the kingdom of heaven.

[Lectio5]
In the honour which is this day paid to the inauguration of the first Bishop's~
throne, an honour is paid to the office of all Bishops. The Churches testify one~
to another, that, the greater the Church's dignity, the greater the reverence~
due to her priests. While I confess how rightly godly custom hath exalted this~
Feast in the estimation of all the Churches, the more do I wonder at the growth~
of that unhealthy error which at this day causeth some unbelievers to lay food~
and wine upon the graves of the dead, as if souls once rid of the body had any~
longer any need of bodily refreshment. quia tanto necesse plus habet ecclesia~
dignitas, quanto sacerdotalis officium plus honoris. Cum sollemnitatem hanc~
ecclesiis merito religiosa observatio introduxerit, miror cur apud quosdam~
infideles hodie tam perniciosus error incruerit, ut super tumulos defunctorum~
cibos et uina conferant, quasi egressć de corporibus animć carnales cibos~
reqirant. Epulas enim et refectiones caro tantum requirit, spiritus autem et~
anima his non indigent. Parare aliquis suis caris dicit, quod ipse devorat; quod~
prćstat uentri, imptat pietati.

[Responsory5]
R. Peter, I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not
* And when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.
V. Flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but My Father Which is in~
heaven.
R. And when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.

[Lectio6]
Cessate ergo fratres ab hoc gentili fidelitatis errore. Animć enim sanctć, quć~
in hoc sćculo aut per uitć innocentiam purć sunt, aut pćnitentić satisfactione~
purgantur, a saluatore nostro recipiuntur, et cum eo esse credendć sunt,~
secundum Apostoli dictum: Cupio dissolui, et esse cum Christo. Animć ergo~
fratrum, parentumque nostrorum, minime cibis carnalibus delectantur. Offendi his~
magis possunt, quam delectari, si, cum illi sacris sedibus sint, uos eas in~
terra esse credatis. Cessate ergo ab his erroribus, et, sicut scriptum est, Quć~
sursum sunt sapite, non quć super terram : ut superstitiones fidei uestrć~
contrarias repudiantes, dum ea, quae deo placita sunt, faciatis, etiam vos cum~
Christo in ćternum essse mereamini quod ipse prćstare dignetur.

[Responsory6]
R. Peter, lovest thou Me? Lord, Thou knowest that I love thee.
* Feed My sheep.
V. Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou Me more than these? Lord, Thou knowest that I~
love thee.
R. Feed My sheep.
&Gloria
R. Feed My sheep.

Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 16:13-19
Abban az időben Jézus Fülöp Cezáreájának vidékére ért, megkérdezte~
tanítványaitól: "Kinek tartják az emberek az Emberfiát?" És így tovább.
_
Homily by Pope St Leo (the Great.)
!3rd on the Anniversary of his own election.
The Lord asked His disciples Who men said that He was, and their answers were~
human as long as they were the answers of human reason, unilluminated by Divine~
light. At last, when the glimmerings of earthly conjecture were spoken, he whose~
Apostleship is the first in dignity, was the first to confess his Lord. And~
Simon Peter answered and said: Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.~
And Jesus answered and said unto him Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona, for flesh~
and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but My Father Which is in heaven. That~
is to say, For this cause art thou blessed, because My Father Himself hath~
taught thee; the opinions of men have not beguiled thee, the voices of angels~
have not taught thee, not flesh and blood, but He, Whose Only begotten Son I am,~
hath revealed Me unto thee.

[Responsory7]
R. Jesus asked His disciples, saying Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?~
Peter answered, and said Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.
* And I say unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My~
Church.
V. Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it~
unto thee, but My Father Which is in heaven.
R. And I say unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My~
Church.

[Lectio8]
Thus saith the Lord unto Simon Peter: And I say also unto thee, That thou art~
Peter. That is to say, Even as My Father hath revealed unto thee concerning Me~
that I am God, even so now will I also reveal unto thee that thou art Peter; I~
am the sure Rock of defence, the Corner Stone, Who make both one, (Eph. ii. 20,~
15,) I am the Foundation, beside Which other can no man lay, (1 Cor. iii. 11,)~
and thou also art a rock, in My Strength made hard, and those things whereof I~
by right am Lord, into thy hand do I give them, that thou mayst bear rule over~
them, for Me, and with Me. And upon this rock I will build My Church, and the~
gates of hell shall not prevail against it. Upon this strength of thine, whereof I~
am the Strength, I will build My eternal temple, and upon the truth of thy~
confession of Me I will make to rise that My glorious Church whose spires shall~
pierce to heaven.

[Responsory8]
R. The Lord hath chosen thee for a priest unto Himself, to offer up unto Him
* The sacrifice of praise.
V. Offer unto God thanksgiving, and pay thy vows unto the Most High.
R. The sacrifice of praise.
&Gloria
R. The sacrifice of praise.

[Lectio9]
Against this confession the gates of hell shall never prevail, neither shall the~
bands of death take hold upon it. Thus saith He That is faithful and true. And~
as this confession hath power to lift up to heaven them that make it, so is it~
able to thrust down to hell them that gainsay it. Wherefore it is said unto the~
most blessed Peter And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven~
and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and~
whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven. This power~
passed indeed to the other Apostles also; this the Lord's will had effect in~
them; but it is not in vain that it is written that that was given to one which~
passed from him to all. To Peter alone were the keys given, and Peter is set as~
the pattern for all them that bear rule in the Church to follow. There remaineth~
therefore the right of Peter, wheresoever his judgment decreeth justice. Neither~
is there anything too hard, or too lax, where there is nothing bound and nothing~
loosed, save when Peter bindeth or looseth.
&teDeum

[Hymnus Laudes]
Peter, blest Shepherd, hearken to our cry,
And with a word unloose our guilty chain;
Thou! who hast power to open the gates on high
To men below, and power to shut them fast again!
_
Praise, blessing, majesty, through endless days,
Be to the Trinity immortal given;
Who in pure unity profoundly sways
Eternally alike all things in earth and heaven.
Ámen.

[Versum 2]
V. Let them exalt Him in the congregation of the people.
R. And praise Him in the assembly of the elders.
