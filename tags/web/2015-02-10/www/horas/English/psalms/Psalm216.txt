(Canticum Ecclesiastici Eccli 36:1-16)
1 Have mercy upon us, O God of all, and behold us, and show us the light of thy mercies: 
2 And send thy fear upon the nations, that have not sought after thee: that they may know that there is no God beside thee, and that they may show forth thy wonders. 
3 Lift up thy hand over the strange nations, that they may see thy power. 
4 For as thou hast been sanctified in us in their sight, so thou shalt be magnified among them in our presence, 
5 That they may know thee, as we also have known thee, that there is no God beside thee, O Lord.
6 Renew thy signs, and work new miracles. 
7 Glorify thy hand, and thy right arm. 
8 Raise up indignation, and pour out wrath. 
9 Take away the adversary, and crush the enemy. 
10 Hasten the time, and remember the end, that they may declare thy wonderful works.
11 Let him that escapeth be consumed by the rage of the fire: and let them perish that oppress thy people. 
12 Crush the head of the princes of the enemies that say: There is no other beside us. 
13 Gather together all the tribes of Jacob: that they may know that there is no God besides thee, and may declare thy great works: and thou shalt inherit them as from the beginning. 
14 Have mercy on thy people, upon whom thy name is invoked: and upon Israel, whom thou hast raised up to be thy firstborn. 
15 Have mercy on Jerusalem, the city which thou hast sanctified, the city of thy rest.
16 Fill Sion with thy unspeakable words, and thy people with thy glory.
