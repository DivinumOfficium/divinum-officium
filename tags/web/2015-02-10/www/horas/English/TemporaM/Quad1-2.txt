From the holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 21:10-17.
In that time when Jesus was come into Jerusalem, the whole city was moved,~
saying: Who is this? And so on.
_
Homily by the Venerable Bede, Priest (at Jarrow.)
!11th for Lent, Tom. vii.
The same thing which the Lord showed in a figure by cursing the barren fig-tree,~
He afterwards more plainly put before us by casting the desecrators out of the~
temple. The tree herself had not sinned by bearing no fruit when the Lord was~
hungry, for the time of figs was not yet come, but those Priests had sinned who~
were carrying on worldly business in the Lord's house, and who neglected to~
bring forth that fruit of godliness which they owed, and which the Lord was~
hungry to find in them. The Lord made the fig-tree to wither away under His~
curse, that all men who saw it, and all men who hear of it, might know that they~
will be condemned by the judgment of God, if they content themselves with the~
talk of godliness, without the solid fruit of good works, even as that barren~
figtree was clothed only with a rustling garb of green leaves.

[Lectio2]
But because the buyers and sellers understood not the parable of the barren~
fig-tree, the Lord brought upon them the stroke of the punishment that they had~
deserved, and cast out the traffickers in earthly things, from that house,~
wherein it had been commanded that nothing should be done save the work of God,~
sacrifices and prayers offered up to Him, and His word read, taught, and sung.~
And yet it may be believed that nothing was being sold or bought in the temple~
save such things as were needful for the service thereof, as we read in another~
place, (John ii. 14,) that when Jesus went into the temple He found those that~
sold oxen and sheep and doves, and all these things were doubtless there for no~
other end but to be offered to God in that His holy house, and were sold by the~
natives to those worshippers who came from a distance, to be so used.

[Lectio3]
If, therefore, the Lord would not have to be sold in the temple, even such~
things as He willed should be offered therein, (On account, that is, of the~
greed or dishonesty which is often the stain of such transactions,) with what~
anger, suppose ye, would He visit such as He might find laughing or gossiping~
there, or yielding to any other sin If the Lord suffer not to be carried on in~
His house such worldly business as may be freely done elsewhere, how much more~
shall such things as ought never to be done anywhere, draw down the anger of God~
if they be done in His own holy house Lastly the Holy Ghost came down upon the~
Lord in the shape of a dove, and by doves therefore may be signified the gifts~
of that Holy Spirit. They, then, to this day sell doves in the temple of God,~
who take money in the Church for the laying on of their hands, whereby the Holy~
Ghost is given from heaven.

[Ant 2]
Jesus went into * the temple of God, * and cast out all them that sold and~
bought and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them~
that sold doves.

[Oratio 2]
Look down, O Lord, on this thy family, and grant that our minds, which, by the~
chastening of the body, we seek to purify, may ever more and more shine in thy~
sight by strong hungering after thee.
$Per Dominum.

[Ant 3]
For it is written * that My house is the house of prayer * for all nations but~
ye have made it a den of thieves and He was daily teaching in the temple.

[Oratio 3]
O Lord, may our prayers come up before thy presence, and do Thou mercifully rid~
thy Church of all wickedness.
$Per Dominum.

!Matt 21:10-17.
21:10 And when he was come into Jerusalem, the whole city was moved, saying: Who is this?
21:11 And the people said: This is Jesus the prophet, from Nazareth of Galilee.
21:12 And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money changers, and the chairs of them that sold doves:
21:13 And he saith to them: It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but you have made it a den of thieves.
21:14 And there came to him the blind and the lame in the temple; and he healed them.
21:15 And the chief priests and scribes, seeing the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying: Hosanna to the son of David; were moved with indignation.
21:16 And said to him: Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus said to them: Yea, have you never read: Out of the mouth of infants and of sucklings thou hast perfected praise?
21:17 And leaving them, he went out of the city into Bethania, and remained there.
