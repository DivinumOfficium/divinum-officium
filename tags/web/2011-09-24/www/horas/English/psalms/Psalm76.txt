76:1 (Unto the end, for Idithun, a psalm of Asaph.)
76:2 I cried to the Lord with my voice; to God with my voice, and he gave ear to me.
76:3 In the days of my trouble I sought God, with my hands lifted up to him in the night, and I was not deceived. My soul refused to be comforted:
76:4 I remembered God, and was delighted, and was exercised, and my spirit swooned away.
76:5 My eyes prevented the watches: I was troubled, and I spoke not.
76:6 I thought upon the days of old: and I had in my mind the eternal years.
76:7 And I meditated in the night with my own heart: and I was exercised and I swept my spirit.
76:8 Will God then cast off for ever? or will he never be more favourable again?
76:9 Or will he cut off his mercy for ever, from generation to generation?
76:10 Or will God forget to shew mercy? or will he in his anger shut up his mercies?
76:11 And I said, Now have I begun: this is the change of the right hand of the most High.
76:12 I remembered the works of the Lord: for I will be mindful of thy wonders from the beginning.
76:13 And I will meditate on all thy works: and will be employed in thy inventions.
76:14 Thy way, O God, is in the holy place: who is the great God like our God?
76:15 Thou art the God that dost wonders. Thou hast made thy power known among the nations:
76:16 With thy arm thou hast redeemed thy people the children of Jacob and of Joseph.
76:17 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee: and they were afraid, and the depths were troubled.
76:18 Great was the noise of the waters: the clouds sent out a sound. For thy arrows pass:
76:19 The voice of thy thunder in a wheel. Thy lightnings enlightened the world: the earth shook and trembled.
76:20 Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in many waters: and thy footsteps shall not be known.
76:21 Thou hast conducted thy people like sheep, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
