Lesson from the book of Genesis
!Gen 2:15-18
15 And the Lord God took man, and put him into the paradise for pleasure, to~
dress it, and keep it.
16 And he commanded him, saying: Of every tree of paradise thou shalt eat:
17 But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat. for in~
what day soever thou shalt eat of it, thou shalt die the death.
18 And the Lord God said: It is not good for man to be alone: let us make him a~
help like unto himself.

!Gen 2:19-20
19 And the Lord God having formed out of the ground all the beasts of the earth,~
and all the fowls of the air, brought them to Adam to see what he would call~
them: for whatsoever Adam called any living creature the same is its name.
20 And Adam called all the beasts by their names, and all the fowls of the air,~
and all the cattle of the field: but for Adam there was not found a helper like~
himself.

!Gen 2:21-24
21 Then the Lord God cast a deep sleep upon Adam: and when he was fast asleep,~
he took one of his ribs, and filled up flesh for it.
22 And the Lord God built the rib which he took from Adam into a woman: and~
brought her to Adam.
23 And Adam said: This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall~
be called woman, because she was taken out of man.
24 Wherefore a man shall leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife:~
and they shall be two in one flesh.
