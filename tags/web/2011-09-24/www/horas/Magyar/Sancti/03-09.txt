[Oratio]
O God, Who didst give unto thy blessed hand-maid Frances many gifts of thy~
heavenly grace, and, among them, to have an angel for her familiar friend;~
mercifully grant that we, being continually holpen through her prayers, may~
worthily attain unto the fellowship of angels hereafter.
$Per Dominum

[Lectio4]
The noble Roman matron Frances A (was born in the year 1384, and) was a pattern~
of godliness from her earliest years. As a child she shrank from games, and set~
no store by the amusements of the world, but delighted to be continually alone~
and engaged in prayer. At the age of eleven years she desired to consecrate her~
virginity to God, and to enter a convent, but humbly yielded obedience to the~
wishes of her parents, and was married to Lawrence de' Pontiani, a young man~
whose rank was equal to his wealth. As a wife she persevered, as far as she~
lawfully could, in her determination to lead an austere life; she abstained as~
much as possible from going to shows, feasts, and such like amusements, dressed~
plainly in woollen stuffs, and spent in prayer or the service of her neighbour~
whatever time she did not occupy with her duties as mistress of her husband's~
house. She strove earnestly to wean the married women of Rome from the vanities~
of the world and the frivolities of dress. To this end she founded during her~
husband's lifetime the Sisterhood of the Oblates, under the rule of the~
Benedictine congregation called of the Mount of Olives. When it pleased God, (in~
the year 1413,) that her husband should be banished, all her goods taken away,~
and her home ruined, she meekly bowed down before His holy will, often repeating~
the words of the blessed Job The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away;~
blessed be the name of the Lord. (i. 21.)

[Lectio5]
On her husband's death she (in 1437) betook herself immediately to the house of~
the Oblates, and, with her feet bare and a rope round her neck, threw herself~
down on the threshold, entreating the sisters with tears to receive her into~
their number. When she obtained her wish, although she was the mother of them~
all, she would be among them only as one that served, glorying rather to be~
called the most degraded of women and a vessel of uncleanness. Her lowly esteem~
of herself was shown both by her word and example. She passed often through the~
city from a vineyard in the country carrying a bundle of sticks on her head, or~
driving an ass laden with faggots; she succoured the needy, for whom she~
collected large alms, and visited the sick in the hospitals, ministering to them~
both food for the body and exhortations healthful for their souls. She strove~
continually to bring her body into subjection by watchings, fastings, haircloth,~
the wearing of an iron girdle, and the often use of a scourge. She never ate but~
once a day, and then only vegetables, and she took no drink but water. These~
severities she however sometimes relaxed, in obedience to her confessor, on~
whose word and wishes she framed her customs.

[Lectio6]
So great was her mental realisation of the things of God, and chiefly of the~
sufferings of the Lord Christ, and so abundant her tears in contemplating them,~
that she seemed sometimes about to sink under her grief. Often when she was~
engaged in prayer, and principally after she had received the Most Holy~
Sacrament of the Eucharist, her spirit became altogether lifted up to God, and~
she remained motionless, carried away by the thought of heavenly things. The~
enemy of man assailed her with divers reproaches and buffetings to break her off~
her intent, but she feared him not, and with the help of an Angel whom God gave~
her to be her familiar friend, she won a noble victory over the tempter. God~
glorified her with the gifts of healing and of prophecy, whereby she foretold~
things to come, and saw the secrets of the hearts of men. More than once while~
her thoughts were busy in God she remained unwet by streams or rain. When there~
was left only bread enough for three sisters, the Lord at her prayers was~
pleased so to multiply it, that fifteen had enough, and the basket was filled~
again with the fragments. In the month of January also, when the sisters were~
gathering sticks in the country, and were thirsty, she satisfied them abundantly~
with bunches of fresh grapes from a tree. She departed to be with the Lord,~
famous for good works and miracles, in the fifty-sixth year of her age, (upon~
the 9th day of March, in the year of our Lord 1440.) The Supreme Pontiff Paul V.~
caused her to be numbered among the saints.

[Lectio94]
Frances, who was to become a noble Roman matron, had resolved at the age of~
eleven to consecrate her virginity to God and enter a convent, but in obedience~
to her parents she married Lorenzo Ponziani, a wealthy young nobleman. In the~
married state she observed, as far as it was lawful for her to do so, the~
austerities oi the stricter life she had intended to lead; and her endurance in~
adversities.was wonderful to see. To counteract the trend toward worldly display~
and vanity among the married women of Rome, she founded a house for Oblates in~
the City. under the rule of St. Benedict and observed in the congregation of~
Monte Oliveto. When her husband died, she retired immediately to this. house and~
begged humbly to become a member of the community. Her petition was granted, and~
she was made superior of the group, but she preferred to call herself the~
handmaid of all and the most worthless of women. She thwarted the tricks by~
which the devil kept trying to entice her, and with the help of her guardian~
Angel turned every temptation into the occasion of a glorious triumph. Renowned~
for her virtues and miracles, she journeyed to the Lord at age of fifty-six.~
Pope Paul V added her name to the list of the Saints.
