[Lectio4]
Bridget was the daughter of princely and godly parents, and was born in Sweden,~
(in the year of our Lord 1304.) Her life was a very holy one. When she was still~
in the womb, her mother was for her sake saved from shipwreck. When she was ten~
years old, she heard a sermon upon the sufferings of the Lord, and the following~
night she saw Jesus on the Cross, covered with fresh Blood, and heard Him~
speaking to her of His same sufferings. From that time forth the thought of them~
touched her so keenly, that she could never again call them to mind without~
weeping.

[Lectio5]
When she was sixteen years of age) she was given in marriage to Ulpho, Prince of~
Nericia. She moved her husband to godly works, as well by her noble ensample as~
by her earnest words. She expended the most motherly care upon the up-bringing~
of her children. She opened an hospital, in which she carefully tended the~
poor, especially the sick, and would wash and kiss their feet. She made a~
pilgrimage with her husband to Compostella, to visit the grave of the holy~
Apostle James. On their way back Ulpho fell grievously sick at Arras, and St~
Denys appeared in the night to Bridget, to tell her as well that her husband~
would be healed, as divers other things to come.

(In the year 1344) her husband died, after having become a Cistercian monk.~
Bridget, having heard the voice of Christ in a dream, took upon herself an~
harder way of life. During her life God made known to her many hidden things.~
She founded the monastery of Wastein, under the Rule of the Holy Saviour, a Rule~
which she had received from the Lord Himself. By the command of God she went~
to Rome, where she stirred up many by her example to seek the love of God.~
Thence she went to Jerusalem, and then returned again to Rome. From this~
pilgrimage she caught a fever, of which she lay sick an whole year in sharp~
sufferings, and then, laden with good works, and after foretelling the day of~
her own death, she departed from earth to heaven, (upon the 23rd day of July, in~
the year 1373.) Her body was taken to the monastery of Wastein. She was famous~
for miracles, and Boniface IX. enrolled her name among those of the Saints.

was so affected bv meditating on the Passion of the Lord that she could not~
think of it without tears. She was given in marriage to Ulf, prince of Nierck,~
and urged him to works of devotion both by her good example and by her effective~
words'. She educated her children most devotedly and served poor and the sick.~
Her husband became a Cistercian monk and died soon after, and Bridget upon~
adopted a more austere way of life. Many secret things ' then divinely revealed~
to her. She. founded the monastery of Vadstena under the rule of the Savior, and~
went to Jerusalem a pilgrimage. Finally at Rome where she he had suffered for a~
