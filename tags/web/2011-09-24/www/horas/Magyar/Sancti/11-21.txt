O Blessed Mary, * Mother of God, Virgin for ever, temple of the Lord, sanctuary of~
the Holy Ghost, thou, without any ensample before thee, didst make thyself~
well-pleasing in the sight of our Lord Jesus Christ. Alleluia.

[Oratio]
O God, Who wast pleased that the blessed Mary always a Virgin, being herself the~
dwelling-place of the Holy Ghost, should, as on this day, be presented in thine~
earthly Temple, grant, we beseech thee, that by her prayers we may worthily be~
presented in the heavenly Temple of thy glory.

[Lectio4]
From the Book Upon the Orthodox Faith, written by St John of Damascus.
!Bk. iv. chap. 15.
Joachim took to wife that most eminent and praiseworthy woman, Anne. And even as~
the antient Hannah, being stricken with barrenness, by prayer and promise became~
the mother of Samuel, so likewise this woman also through prayer and promise~
received from God the Mother of God, that in fruitfulness she might not be~
behind any of the famous matrons. And thus grace (for such is the~
signification of the name of Anne) is mother of the Lady (for such is the~
signification of the name of Mary. ) And indeed she became the Lady of every~
creature, since she hath been mother of the Creator. She first saw the light in~
Joachim's house, hard by the Pool of Bethesda, at Jerusalem, and was carried to~
the Temple. There planted in the Lord, the dew of His Spirit made her to~
flourish in the courts of her God, and like a green olive she became a tree, so~
that all the doves of grace came and lodged in her branches. And so she raised~
her mind utterly above the lust of life and the lust of the flesh, and kept her~
soul virgin in her virgin body, as became her that was to receive God into her~
womb.

[Lectio5]
From the Book Upon Virgins, written by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!ii.
Such was Mary that her single life offereth an ensample to all. If then the doer~
displease us not, let us applaud the deed; if any other woman seek like reward,~
let her follow after like works. In the one Virgin how many glorious examples do~
shine forth. Her's was the hidden treasure of modesty, her's the high standard~
of faith, her's the self-sacrifice of earnestness, her's to be the pattern of~
maidenhood at home, of kinswomanhood in ministry, of motherhood in the Temple. O~
to how many virgins hath she been helpful, how many hath she taken in her arms~
and presented unto the Lord, saying Here is one who, (like me,) hath kept~
stainlessly clean the wedding -chamber, the marriage -bed of my Son!

[Lectio6]
Why should I go on to speak of the scantiness of her eating, or of the~
multiplicity of her work? how her labour seemed above human capacity, and her~
refreshment insufficient for human strength, her toil never missing a moment,~
her fasting taking two days together. And when she was fain to eat, she took not~
dainties, but whatsoever food came first to hand that would keep body and soul~
together. She would not sleep till need was, and even then, while her body~
rested, her soul watched, for she often talked in her sleep, either repeating~
things that she had read, or going on with what she was doing before sleep~
interrupted her, or rehearsing things executed, or talking of things projected.

[Responsory7]
R. O Holy Virgin Mary, happy indeed art thou, and right worthy of all praise
* For out of thee rose the Sun of righteousness, even Christ our God.
V. Pray for the people, plead for the clergy, make intercession for all women~
vowed to God. May all that are keeping this thine holy Presentation-day feel the might~
of thine assistance.
R. For out of thee rose the Sun of righteousness, even Christ our God.

[Ant 2]
O Blessed Mary, * Mother of God, Virgin for ever, temple of the Lord, sanctuary~
of the Holy Ghost, thou, without any ensample before thee, didst make thyself~
well-pleasing in the sight of our Lord Jesus Christ pray for the people, plead~
for the clergy, make intercession for all women vowed to God.

[Lectio94]
Joachim married Anna a most excellent and praiseworthy woman. Once there had~
lived another Anna who overcame physical sterility through prayer and a promise~
to God, and then gave birth to Samuel. In a similar waY our Anne received from~
God the Mother of God through a vow and heartfelt petition; for she would not~
yield in any way to the illustrious women of previous ages. Accordingly grace~
(for the word Anne means grace) gave birth to the Lady (this is signified by the~
name Mary). Truly Mary became the Lady above all creation in her role as the~
Mother of the Creator. She was born in Joachim's house near the Probatica, and~
was presented in the temple. Thereupon "planted in the house of God" had~
nurtured by His Spirit; like a fruitful olive tree she flowered forth in every~
virtue. From her mind she drove every worldly or sensual desire; she preserved~
virginity of soul as well as of body, as was becoming to one destined to carry~
God in her very bosom.
