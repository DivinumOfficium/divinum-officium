Lesson from the second book of Kings
!2 Kgs 18:1-5
1 In the third year of Osee the son of Ela king of Israel, reigned Ezechias the son of Achaz king of Juda.
2 He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign: and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Abi the daughter of Zacharias.
3 And he did that which was good before the Lord, according to all that David his father had done.
4 He destroyed the high places, and broke the statues in pieces, and cut down the groves, and broke the brazen serpent, which Moses had made: for till that time the children of Israel burnt incense to it: and he called its name Nohestan.
5 He trusted in the Lord the God of Israel:

5 so that after him there was none like him among all the kings of Juda,nor any of them that were before him:
6 And he stuck to the Lord, and departed not from his steps, but kept his commandments, which the Lord commanded Moses.
7 Wherefore the Lord also was with him, and in all things, to which he went forth, he behaved himself wisely. And he rebelled against the king of the Assyrians, and served him not.
8 He smote the Philistines as far as Gaza, and all their borders, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.

9 In the fourth year of king Ezechias, which was the seventh year of Osee the son of Ela king of Israel, Salmanasar king of the Assyrians came up to Samaria, and besieged it,
10 And took it. For after three years, in the sixth year of Ezechias, that is, in the ninth year of Osee king of Israel, Samaria was taken:
11 And the king of the Assyrians carried away Israel into Assyria, and placed them in Hale, and in Habor by the rivers of Gozan in the cities of the Medes:
12 Because they hearkened not to the voice of the Lord their God, but transgressed his covenant: all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded, they would not hear nor do.
