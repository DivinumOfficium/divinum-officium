84:1 (Unto the end, for the sons of Core, a psalm.)
84:2 Lord, thou hast blessed thy land: thou hast turned away the captivity of Jacob.
84:3 Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people: thou hast covered all their sins.
84:4 Thou hast mitigated all thy anger: thou hast turned away from the wrath of thy indignation.
84:5 Convert us, O God our saviour: and turn off thy anger from us.
84:6 Wilt thou be angry with us for ever: or wilt thou extend thy wrath from generation to generation?
84:7 Thou wilt turn, O God, and bring us to life: and thy people shall rejoice in thee.
84:8 Shew us, O Lord, thy mercy; and grant us thy salvation.
84:9 I will hear what the Lord God will speak in me: for he will speak peace unto his people: And unto his saints: and unto them that are converted to the heart.
84:10 Surely his salvation is near to them that fear him that glory may dwell in our land.
84:11 Mercy and truth have met each other: justice and peace have kissed.
84:12 Truth is sprung out of the earth: and justice hath looked down from heaven.
84:13 For the Lord will give goodness: and our earth shall yield her fruit.
84:14 Justice shall walk before him: andshall set his steps in the way.
