Festum Domini

[Ant Vespera]
He shall be called * Peaceable, and his throne shall be most firm for ever.
His kingdom * is an everlasting kingdom, and all kings shall serve him, and shall obey him.
Behold a man, the Orient * is his name: he shall sit and rule, and shall speak peace to the Gentiles.
The Lord * is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver: the Lord is our king, he will save us.
Behold, I have given thee * to be the light of the Gentiles, that thou mayst be my salvation even to the farthest part of the earth.

[Capitulum Vespera]
!Col 1:12-13
v. Brethren: We give thanks to God the Father, who hath made us worthy to be~
partakers of the lot of the saints in light, who hath delivered us from the~
power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his~
love.
$Deo gratias

[Hymnus Vespera]
v. To thee, O Prince of all that be,
Thou Christ, O King eternally;
O Framer of the mind and heart,
Our one true Judge we say thou art.
_
The wicked protest, wail and cry,
Christ Jesus reign they would deny;
Rejoice we at thy glorious name,
Thou Highest King we do proclaim.
_
O Christ! The Source of all our peace,
Make all our sinful thoughts to cease;
And still in us our loves misplaced,
As Thy one sheepfold be we embraced.
_
For this, hanging on cruel tree,
With arms outstretched, for all to see;
His heart is pierced by soldiers spear,
Revealing burning love most dear.
_
From this the altar of the tree
Thy blood flows forth from Calvary;
As wine to us it doth appear,
To thine own heart it draws us near.
_
Thou Governor of all that be,
May all thy creatures honour thee;
All those who rule, O Lord renew!
Source of all precepts just and true.
_
To regal glory, all submit,
All crowns and honours we do remit;
To thy scepterso sweet and mild!
Submit we as a little child.
_
All glory be, Jesu, to thee,
Thy scepter over all that be;
All glory, as is ever meet,
To Father and to Paraclete.
Ámen.

[Doxology]
All glory be, Jesu, to thee,
Thy scepter over all that be;
All glory, as is ever meet,
To Father and to Paraclete.

[Versum 1]
V. Given to me is all power.
R. In heaven and in earth.

[Ant 1]
The Lord God * shall give unto him the throne of David, his father: and he shall~
reign in the house of Jacob for ever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end,~
alleluia.

[Oratio]
Almighty and everlasting God, who in thy beloved Son, the King of the whole~
world, hast willed to restore all things: mercifully grant that all the families~
of ations, now kept apart by the wound of sin, may be brought under the sweet~
yoke of his rule.
$Qui tecum

[Invit]
Jesus Christ the King of kings * come let us adore!

[Hymnus Matutinum]
Eternal image of the most high,
God, light from light,
to you, Redeemer, be glory,
honour, royal power.
_
You alone, before all time,
are the hope and pivot of the years;
_
You, the flower of a chaste virgin,
the head of our race,
the stone falling from on high,
and occupying the earth with might.
_
Once harsh tyranny has been overcome,
new growth through you shatters
the accursed bonds of the dead
and restores the heavens to their rightful place.
_
Teacher, priest, lawgiver,
supporting the marked man through
your own blood: prince of princes
and highest king among kings.
_
We willingly submit to you
who rule all things in equity.
_
All glory be, Jesu, to thee,
Thy scepter over all that be;
All glory, as is ever meet,
To Father and to Paraclete. 
Amen.

Olvasmány szent Pál apostol Kolosszeiekhez írott leveléből
!Col 1:3-8
3 Hálát adunk Istennek, Urunk, Jézus Krisztus Atyjának, valahányszor értetek~
imádkozunk.
4 Hallottunk ugyanis Jézus Krisztusba vetett hitetekről és arról a szeretetről,~
amelyet minden szent iránt tanúsíttok
5 annak reményében, ami készen vár rátok a mennyben. Erről az evangélium igaz~
tanításában hallottatok,
6 amely hozzátok is eljutott, s amint az egész világon gyümölcsözik és~
gyarapszik, úgy nálatok is attól a naptól kezdve, hogy meghallottátok, és az~
Isten kegyelmét felismertétek az igazságban.
7 Így tanultátok ezt kedves szolgatársunktól, Epafrásztól. Ő hűséges~
szolgája köztetek Krisztusnak,
8 ő beszélt nekünk lélekből fakadó szeretetetekről is.

[Responsory1]
R. He shall sit upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom forever
* And His name shall be called God, the Mighty, the Prince of peace
V. His dominion is vast and forever peaceful
R. And His name shall be called God, the Mighty, the Prince of peace

[Lectio2]
!Col 1:9-16
9 Amióta erről hallottunk, mi is szüntelenül imádkozunk értetek, és könyörgünk,~
hogy akaratát teljesen ismerjétek, nagy bölcsességgel és lelki megértéssel.
10 Így majd az Úrhoz méltón éltek, egészen az ő tetszése szerint, minden~
jótettben gyümölcsöt hoztok, és az Isten ismeretében gyarapodtok.
11 Dicsőséges hatalmában szilárdítson meg titeket nagy erővel, hogy mindvégig~
kitartsatok és állhatatosak legyetek. Örömmel
12 adjatok hálát az Atyának, aki arra méltatott benneteket, hogy részetek legyen a~
szentek örökségében, a világosságban;
13 kiragadott minket a sötétség hatalmából, és áthelyezett szeretett Fia~
országába.
14 Benne nyertük el a megváltást, bűneink bocsánatát.
15 O" a láthatatlan Isten képmása, minden teremtmény elsőszülötte.
16 Mert benne teremtett mindent a mennyben és a földön: a láthatókat és a~
láthatatlanokat, a trónusokat, uralmakat, fejedelemségeket és hatalmasságokat.~
Mindent általa és érte teremtetett.

[Responsory2]
R. In the vision during the night I saw the Son of man coming on the clouds of~
heaven; and He was given kingship and glory
* Nations and people of every language serve Him
V. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that shall not be taken away, His~
kingship shall not be destroyed
R. Nations and people of every language serve Him

[Lectio3]
!Col 1:17-23
17 O" előbb van mindennél, és minden benne áll fenn.
18 Ő a testnek, az Egyháznak a feje. Ő a kezdet, az elsőszülött a~
halottak közül, hogy övé legyen az elsőség mindenben.
19 Úgy tetszett (az Atyának), hogy benne lakjék az egész teljesség,
20 s hogy általa békítsen ki magával mindent a földön és a mennyben, minthogy
Ő a kereszten vérével békességet szerzett.
21 Nektek is, akik azelőtt idegenek és ellenséges érzületűek voltatok gonosz
tetteitek következtében,
22 most nektek is megszerezte a kiengesztelődést halandó testében a halál árán,
hogy szentté, szeplőtlenné és feddhetetlenné tegyen benneteket színe előtt.
23 Csak álljatok szilárdan és rendületlenül a hitben, és ne tántorodjatok el az
evangéliumi reménytől, amelyről hallottatok, hiszen minden teremtménynek
hirdették az ég alatt, és én, Pál is ennek a szolgája lettem.

[Responsory3]
R. You, Betlehem-Effrata, too small among the clans of Juda, from you shall come~
forth for Me one who is to be ruler in Israel;
* And He shall be Peace.
V. His origin is from old, from ancient times. He shall stand firm and shepherd~
his flock by the strength of the Lord.
R. And He shall be Peace.
&Gloria
R. And He shall be Peace.

Ex Litteris Encyclicis Pii Papae undecimi
!Litt. Encycl. Quas primas diei 11 Decembris 1925
Since this Holy Year therefore has provided more than one opportunity to enhance~
the glory of the kingdom of Christ, we deem it in keeping with our Apostolic~
office to accede to the desire of many of the Cardinals, Bishops, and faithful,~
made known to Us both individually and collectively, by closing this Holy Year~
with the insertion into the Sacred Liturgy of a special feast of the Kingship of~
Our Lord Jesus Christ. This matter is so dear to Our heart, Venerable Brethren,~
that I would wish to address to you a few words concerning it. It will be for~
you later to explain in a manner suited to the understanding of the faithful~
what We are about to say concerning the Kingship of Christ, so that the annual~
feast which We shall decree may be attended with much fruit and produce~
beneficial results in the future. It has long been a common custom to give to~
Christ the metaphorical title of "King," because of the high degree of~
perfection whereby he excels all creatures. So he is said to reign "in the~
hearts of men," both by reason of the keenness of his intellect and the extent~
of his knowledge, and also because he is very truth, and it is from him that~
truth must be obediently received by all mankind. He reigns, too, in the wills~
of men, for in him the human will was perfectly and entirely obedient to the~
Holy Will of God, and further by his grace and inspiration he so subjects our~
free-will as to incite us to the most noble endeavors. He is King of hearts, too,~
by reason of his "charity which exceedeth all knowledge." And his mercy and~
kindness which draw all men to him, for never has it been known, nor will it~
ever be, that man be loved so much and so universally as Jesus Christ. But if we~
ponder this matter more deeply, we cannot but see that the title and the power~
of King belongs to Christ as man in the strict and proper sense too. For it is~
only as man that he may be said to have received from the Father "power and~
glory and a kingdom," since the Word of God, as consubstantial with the Father,~
has all things in common with him, and therefore has necessarily supreme and~
absolute dominion over all things created.

[Responsory4]
R. Rejoice heartily, o daughter Sion, and shout for you, o daughter Jerusalem!~
See your King shall come to you; a just Savior is He!
* And He shall proclaim peace to the nations.
V. His dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the river, to the ends of the~
earth.
R. And He shall proclaim peace to the nations.

[Lectio5]
The foundation of this power and dignity of Our Lord is rightly indicated by~
Cyril of Alexandria. "Christ," he says, "has dominion over all creatures, a~
dominion not seized by violence nor usurped, but his by essence and by nature."~
His kingship is founded upon the ineffable hypostatic union. From this it~
follows not only that Christ is to be adored by angels and men, but that to him~
as man angels and men are subject, and must recognize his empire; by reason of~
the hypostatic union Christ has power over all creatures. But a thought that~
must give us even greater joy and consolation is this that Christ is our King by~
acquired, as well as by natural right, for he is our Redeemer. Would that they~
who forget what they have cost their Savior might recall the words: "You were~
not redeemed with corruptible things, but with the precious blood of Christ, as~
of a lamb unspotted and undefiled." We are no longer our own property, for~
Christ has purchased us "with a great price"; our very bodies are the "members~
of Christ." Let Us explain briefly the nature and meaning of this lordship of~
Christ. It consists, We need scarcely say, in a threefold power which is~
essential to lordship. This is sufficiently clear from the scriptural testimony~
already adduced concerning the universal dominion of our Redeemer, and moreover~
it is a dogma of faith that Jesus Christ was given to man, not only as our~
Redeemer, but also as a law-giver, to whom obedience is due. Not only do the~
gospels tell us that he made laws, but they present him to us in the act of~
making them. Those who keep them show their love for their Divine Master, and he~
promises that they shall remain in his love. He claimed judicial power as~
received from his Father, when the Jews accused him of breaking the Sabbath by~
the miraculous cure of a sick man. "For neither doth the Father judge any man;~
but hath given all judgment to the Son." In this power is included the right of~
rewarding and punishing all men living, for this right is inseparable from that~
of judging. Executive power, too, belongs to Christ, for all must obey his~
commands; none may escape them, nor the sanctions he has imposed.

[Responsory5]
R. He must reign, for God has put all things under His feet,
* That God may be all in all!
V. When all things are made subject to Him, then the Son Himself will also be~
made subject to the Father.
R. That God may be all in all!

[Lectio6]
This kingdom is spiritual and is concerned with spiritual things. That this is~
so the above quotations from Scripture amply prove, and Christ by his own action~
confirms it. On many occasions, when the Jews and even the Apostles wrongly~
supposed that the Messiah would restore the liberties and the kingdom of Israel,~
he repelled and denied such a suggestion. When the populace thronged around him~
in admiration and would have acclaimed him King, he shrank from the honor and~
sought safety in flight. Before the Roman magistrate he declared that his~
kingdom was not of this world. The gospels present this kingdom as one which men~
prepare to enter by penance, and cannot actually enter except by faith and by~
baptism, which, though an external rite, signifies and produces an interior~
regeneration. This kingdom is opposed to none other than to that of Satan and to~
the power of darkness. It demands of its subjects a spirit of detachment from~
riches and earthly things, and a spirit of gentleness. They must hunger and~
thirst after justice, and more than this, they must deny themselves and carry~
the cross. Christ as our Redeemer purchased the Church at the price of his own~
blood; as priest he offered himself, and continues to offer himself as a victim~
for our sins. Is it not evident, then, that his kingly dignity partakes in a~
manner of both these offices? It would be a grave error, on the other hand, to~
say that Christ has no authority whatever in civil affairs, since, by virtue of~
the absolute empire over all creatures committed to him by the Father, all~
things are in his power. Therefore by Our Apostolic Authority We institute the~
Feast of the Kingship of Our Lord Jesus Christ to be observed yearly throughout~
the whole world on the last Sunday of the month of October - the Sunday, that is,~
which immediately precedes the Feast of All Saints. We further ordain that the~
dedication of mankind to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, to be renewed yearly.

[Responsory6]
R. He has made us to be a kingdom, and priest to God His Father;
* To Him belong glory and dominion forever and ever!
V. He is the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth.
R. To Him belong glory and dominion forever and ever!
&Gloria
R. To Him belong glory and dominion forever and ever!

Evangélium szent János Apostol kőnyvéből
!John 18:33-37
Azon időben: Pilátus így szólt Jézushoz: "Te vagy a zsidók királya?" Jézus ezt~
felelte: "Magadtól mondod ezt vagy mások mondták neked rólam?" És így tovább.
_
What great matter was it for the King of all worlds to become King of men? For~
Christ was not King of Israel for exacting of tribute, or arming a host with the~
sword, and visibly subduing enemies: but King of Israel that he should rule~
minds, that he should counsel for eternity, that he should bring unto the~
kingdom of heaven them that believe, hope, and love. Being then, Son of God, the~
Word by whom all things were made, that it should be his will to be King of~
Israel is condenscension, not preferment, a betokening of mercy, not an~
increasing of power. For he who was called on earth King of the Jews is in~
heaven Lord of the Angels. But is Christ King of the Jews only, or also King of~
the Gentiles ? Yea, of the Gentiles also. For when he said in the prophecy: But I~
am set by him as King upon Sion his holy mountain, preaching the precepts of the~
Lord, lest on account of the Mount Sion, any shpuld say that he was set as King~
only of the Jews, he hath straightway subjoined: The Lord hath said unto me,~
Thou art my Son: this day I have begotten thee. Ask of me, and I shall give thee~
the heathen for thy inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy~
possession.

[Responsory7]
R. The kingdom of this world has became the kingdom of our Lord, and of His~
Christ,
* And He shall reign for ever and ever.
V. All the families of the nations shall bow down before Him; for dominion is~
the Lord's.
R. And He shall reign for ever and ever.

[Lectio8]
!Tract. 115 in Joannem 18-36.
Jesus answered: My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this~
world, then would my servants fight, that I should be delivered to the Jews; but~
now is my kingdom not from hence. This it is which was the will of our Good~
Master that we should know: but first we were to be shown the vanity of the~
opinion concerning his kingdom, entertained by men, whether Gentiles or Jews,~
from whom Pilate had heard that: as if the reason why he must be punished by~
death, were that he had affected a kingdom to which he had no right; or because~
the reigning are wont to look with an evil eye upon those destined to reign; and~
there were indeed need to beware lest his kingdom should be adverse either to~
the Romans or the Jews. Now the Lord might have answered at once: My kingdom is~
not from hence: to the first question put by the Governor, Art thou the King of~
the Jews ? But in putting a question in return, namely, whether he spake this of~
himself, or had been told it by others, it was his will to show by Pilate's~
reply that this had been laid up to him as a crime by the Jews in their~
conference with the Governor: thus laying open to us, The thoughts of men, which~
he knew: that they are vain: and to them after Pilate's answer, making a reply~
which was more reasonable and suitable both to Jews and to Gentiles: My kingdom~
is not of this world.

[Responsory8]
R. The ten horns that you saw are the kings. These will fight with the Lamb, and~
the Lamb will overcome them.
* For He is the Lord of lords and the King of Kings.
V. The Lord our God Almighty now reigns,! Let us be glad and rejoice, and give~
glory to Him.
R. For He is the Lord of lords and the King of Kings.
&Gloria
R. For He is the Lord of lords and the King of Kings.

[Ant Laudes]
The God of heaven * will set up a kingdom that shall break in pieces and shall consume all these kingdoms, and itself shall stand for ever.
The Lord gave him * power and glory, and a kingdom; and all peoples, tribes and tongues shall serve him.
Living waters shall go out * from Jerusalem; and the Lord shall be king over all the earth.
Now shall he be magnified * even to the ends of the earth, and this man shall be our peace.
The nation and the kingdom * that will not serve thee, shall perish: and the Gentiles shall be wasted with desolation.
