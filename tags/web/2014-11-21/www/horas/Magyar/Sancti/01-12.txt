!Rom 16:1-5
1 Ajánlom nektek Főbe nővérünket, aki a kenkreai egyház szolgálatában áll.
2 Fogadjátok szentekhez méltóan az Úrban, és támogassátok, amiben csak rátok~
szorul, mert ő is sokaknak volt támasza, nekem magamnak is.
3 Köszöntsétek Priszkát és Aquilát, munkatársaimat Krisztus Jézusban.
4 Ők életüket kockáztatták értem. Ezért nem csupán én vagyok nekik hálás, hanem a~
pogányságból megtért minden egyházközség.
5 Köszöntsétek a házukban összejövő közösséget. Köszöntsétek kedves~
Epenétuszomat, Ázsia zsengéjét Krisztusban.

!Rom 16:17-19
17 Kérlek azonban titeket, testvérek, tartsátok szemmel azokat, akik ellentétben a~
kapott tanítással széthúzást és botrányt okoznak. Kerüljétek őket.
18 Az ilyenek nem Krisztus Urunknak szolgálnak, hanem a hasuknak, és szép~
szavakkal meg hízelgéssel megtévesztik a gyanútlanok szívét.
19 Engedelmességetek híre ugyanis mindenhová eljutott: örömöm is telik bennetek.~
Mégis szeretném, hogy a jóban járatosak legyetek, a rosszban ellenben~
járatlanok.

!Rom 16:21-24
21 Üdvözölnek titeket: munkatársam, Timóteus és rokonaim: Lúciusz, Jázon meg~
Szoszipater.
22 Üdvözöllek titeket az Úrban én, Terciusz is, aki a levelet írtam.
23 Üdvözöl titeket Gájusz, aki nekem és az egész közösségnek házigazdája.~
Üdvözöl titeket Erasztus, aki a város vagyonát kezeli és Quartusz testvér.
24 Az Úr Jézus kegyelme mindnyájatokkal!

From the Sermons of Pope St Leo (the Great.)
!5th on the the Twelfth day
This meet and right, dearly beloved brethren, yea, it is our bounden duty and~
godly service, to rejoice with full hearts upon those days which more especially~
set forth before us the workings of God's mercy; and to have in honourable~
memory those things that were done for our salvation. Hereto are we called by~
the seasons of the year which continually return, and notably by this present,~
which, after but a short time hath passed since that day whereon the Coeternal~
Son of God was born of a Virgin, bringeth now the Feast of the Epiphany,~
hallowed by the Manifestation of the Lord.

[Lectio5]
In this said Manifestation the good Providence of God hath appointed a strong~
bulwark to our faith. For now, while in solemn worship we call to mind how the~
childhood of the Saviour was adored in its first infancy, we receive from the~
original Scriptures the doctrine that Christ was born with the very nature of~
man. For this is that which maketh of sinners saints, even to believe that in~
one and the same our Lord Jesus Christ there is very Godhead and very Manhood~
very Godhead, as touching Which, He, being in the form of God, is equal to the~
Father from everlasting to everlasting and very Manhood, wherein He, taking upon~
Him the form of a servant, hath in these latter days been born Man.

[Lectio6]
For the strengthening of this our faith, which we profess in the face of every~
false doctrine, the mercy of God hath made it to come to pass that one of those~
peoples who dwell in the uttermost parts of the East, and excel in the skill of~
reading the stars, should see the sign of the birth of that Child Who was to~
reign over all Israel. There appeared to the eyes of wise men a new star of such~
passing beauty, as wrought in the minds of all that saw it the persuasion that~
the event, which is announced, was of an importance not to be neglected.

Evangélium szent Lukács Evangélista kőnyvéből
!Luke 2:42-52
Amikor Jézus tizenkét éves lett, szintén fölmentek, az ünnepi szokás szerint. Az~
ünnepnapok elteltével hazafelé indultak. A gyermek Jézus azonban Jeruzsálemben~
maradt És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!Bk. ii. on Luke ii.
We read that when He was twelve years old the Lord began to dispute. The number~
of His years was the same as the number of the Apostles whom He afterwards sent~
forth to preach the Faith. He Who, as touching His Manhood, was filled with~
wisdom and grace from God, was not careless of the parents of the same Manhood,~
and, after three days, was pleased to be found in the Temple thereby~
foreshadowing that, after the three days of His victorious Passion, He That had~
been reckoned with the dead, would present Himself, living, to our faith, in His~
heavenly Kingship and Divine Majesty.

[Lectio8]
How is it that ye sought Me? Christ hath two Generations; one from His Father,~
another from His Mother. That from His Father is His Eternal Generation as God~
the Son; that from His Mother is that whereby He came to work for us and~
minister to us. Those acts, therefore, of His, which are above nature, beyond~
His age, and different to His custom, proceeded not from the strength of His~
Manhood, but from the power of His Godhead. On another occasion His Mother~
moveth Him to work a miracle; here He answereth her, because she treateth that~
which was of the Godhead, as though it had been of the Manhood. On this occasion~
it is said that He was twelve years old, but on the other He had already~
disciples. His mother had seen His wonders on the earlier occasion, and had~
learnt from her Son to call on the mightier nature for a work of power.

[Lectio9]
And He came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them. No wonder that the great~
Teacher should practise. And shall we marvel how He Who was subject to His~
Mother, was about His Father's business? His subjection to His Mother proceeded,~
not from weakness, but from dutiful affection. Nevertheless, the false serpent~
lifteth its head from its cruel lair, and spitteth poison from its venomous~
breast. The heretics say that, as the Son was sent by the Father, therefore the~
Father is greater than the Son, and, if the Father be greater than the Son,~
there is that, than which the Son is less; yea, that He Who is sent, hath of~
necessity, need of some strengthening from outside Himself. He was subject to~
His Mother? Was He less than she? God forbid!

[Ant 2]
Without controversy * great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of Angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory, alleluia.

[Ant 3]
This day we keep a holiday in honour of three wonders, * this day a star led the~
wise men to the manger; this day at the marriage, water was made wine; this day~
was Christ, for our salvation, pleased to be baptized of John in Jordan.~
Alleluia.
