02-17# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 14: How Night Office Is to Be Said On the Feasts of Saints
_
On the festivals of saints and on other solemn days let office be said in such wise as we have explained it is to be said on the Lord’s day, except that there are to be said the psalms, antiphons and lections proper to such day. Their number, however, shall remain as we have appointed above.
