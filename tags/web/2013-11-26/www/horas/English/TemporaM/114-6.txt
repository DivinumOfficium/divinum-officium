Here beginneth Prophet Jonas
!Jonah 1:1-4
1  Now the word of the Lord came to Jonas the son of Amathi, saying:
2  Arise, and go to Ninive the great city, and preach in it: for the wickedness thereof is come up before me.
3  And Jonas rose up to flee into Tharsis from the face of the Lord, and he went down to Joppe, and found a ship going to Tharsis: and he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them to Tharsis from the face of the Lord.
4  But the Lord sent a great wind into the sea: and a great tempest was raised in the sea, and the ship was in danger to be broken.

!Jonah 1:5-7
5  And the mariners were afraid, and the men cried to their god: and they cast forth the wares that were in the ship, into the sea, to lighten it of them: and Jones went down into the inner part of the ship, and fell into a deep sleep.
6  And the shipmaster came to him, and said to him: Why art thou fast asleep? rise up, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think of us, that we may not perish.
7  And they said every one to his fellow: Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know why this evil is upon us. And they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonas.

!Jonah 1:8-12
8  And they said to him: Tell us for what cause this evil is upon us, what is thy business? of what country art thou? and whither goest thou? or of what people art thou?
9  And he said to them: I am a Hebrew, and I fear the Lord the God of heaven, who made both the sea and the dry land.
10  And the men were greatly afraid, and they said to him: Why hast thou done this? (for the men knew that he fled from the face of the Lord: because he had told them.)
11  And they said to him: What shall we do to thee, that the sea may be calm to us? for the sea flowed and swelled.
12  And he said to them: Take me up, and cast me into the sea, and the sea shall be calm to you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.
