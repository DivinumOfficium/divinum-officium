!1 Mac 2:7-10
7 And Mathathias said: Woe is me, wherefore was I born to see the ruin of my~
people, and the ruin of the holy city, and to dwell there, when it is given into~
the hands of the enemies?
8 The holy places are come into the hands of strangers: her temple is become as a~
man without honour.
9 The vessels of her glory are carried away captive: her old men are murdered in~
the streets, and her young men are fallen by the sword of the enemies.
10 What nation hath not inherited her kingdom, and gotten of her spoils?

[Responsory2]
R. Thou, O Lord of all things, Who hast need of nothing, wast pleased that the~
Temple of thine habitation should be among us.
* Therefore now, O Lord, keep this house ever undefiled
V. Thou, O Lord, didst choose this house, that thy Name should be called on~
therein, and to be an house of prayer and petition for thy people.
R. Therefore now, O Lord, keep this house ever undefiled.

14 And Mathathias and his sons rent their garments, and they covered themselves~
with haircloth, and made great lamentation.
15 And they that were sent from king Antiochus came thither, to compel them that~
were fled into the city of Modin, to sacrifice, and to burn incense, and to~
depart from the law of God.
16 And many of the people of Israel consented, and came to them: but Mathathias~
and his sons stood firm.

round about us to punish us.
* But Thou, O Lord, stretch forth thine arm, and deliver our souls.
V. Punish them that oppress us and with pride do us wrong, and keep thine own~
portion.
R. But Thou, O Lord, stretch forth thine arm, and deliver our souls.

R. But Thou, O Lord, stretch forth thine arm, and deliver our souls.
