36:14 Have mercy on thy people, upon whom thy name is invoked: and upon Israel, whom thou hast raised up to be thy firstborn.
36:15 Have mercy on Jerusalem, the city which thou hast sanctified, the city of thy rest.
36:16 Fill Sion with thy unspeakable words, and thy people with thy glory.
36:17 Give testimony to them that are thy creatures from the beginning, and raise up the prophecies which the former prophets spoke in thy name.
36:18 Reward them that patiently wait for thee, that thy prophets may be found faithful: and hear the prayers of thy servants,
36:19 According to the blessing of Aaron over thy people, and direct us into the way of justice, and let all know that dwell upon the earth, that thou art God the beholder of all ages.
