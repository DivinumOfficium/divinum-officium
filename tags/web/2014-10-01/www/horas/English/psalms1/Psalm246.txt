(Canticum Habacuc * Hab 3:1-6)
3:1 A PRAYER OF HABACUC THE PROPHET FOR IGNORANCES.
3:2 O Lord, I have heard thy hearing, and was afraid. O Lord, thy work, in the midst of the years bring it to life: In the midst of the years thou shalt make it known: when thou art angry, thou wilt remember mercy.
3:3 God will come from the south, and the holy one from mount Pharan: His glory covered the heavens, and the earth is full of his praise.
3:4 His brightness shall be as the light; horns are in his hands: There is his strength hid:
3:5 Death shall go before his face. And the devil shall go forth before his feet.
3:6 He stood and measured the earth. He beheld, and melted the nations: and the ancient mountains were crushed to pieces. The hills of the world were bowed down by the journeys of his eternity.
