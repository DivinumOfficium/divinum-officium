From the Acts of Apostles.
!Acts 3:1-6
1 Now Peter and John went up into the temple at the ninth hour of prayer.
2 And a certain man who was lame from his mother's womb, was carried: whom they~
laid every day at the gate of the temple, which is called Beautiful, that he~
might ask alms of them that went into the temple.
3 He, when he had seen Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked to~
receive an alms.
4 But Peter with John fastening his eyes upon him, said: Look upon us.
5 But he looked earnestly upon them, hoping that he should receive something of~
them.
6 But Peter said: Silver and gold I have none; but what I have, I give thee: In~
the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, arise, and walk.

Acts 3:7-11
7 And taking him by the right hand, he lifted him up, and forthwith his feet and~
soles received strength.
8 And he leaping up, stood, and walked, and went in with them into the temple,~
walking, and leaping, and praising God.
9 And all the people saw him walking and praising God.
10 And they knew him, that it was he who sat begging alms at the Beautiful gate~
of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had~
happened to him.
11 And as he held Peter and John, all the people ran to them to the porch which~
is called Solomon's, greatly wondering

Acts 3:12-16
12 But Peter seeing, made answer to the people: Ye men of Israel, why wonder you~
at this? or why look you upon us, as if by our strength or power we had made~
this man to walk?
13 The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of~
our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus, whom you indeed delivered up and~
denied before the face of Pilate, when he judged he should be released.
14 But you denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be~
granted unto you.
15 But the author of life you killed, whom God hath raised from the dead, of~
which we are witnesses.
16 And in the faith of his name, this man, whom you have seen and known, hath~
his name strengthened; and the faith which is by him, hath given this perfect~
soundness in the sight of you all.
