68:1 (Unto the end, for them that shall be changed; for David.)
68:2 Save me, O God: for the waters are come in even unto my soul.
68:3 I stick fast in the mire of the deep and there is no sure standing. I am come into the depth of the sea, and a tempest hath overwhelmed me.
68:4 I have laboured with crying; my jaws are become hoarse, my eyes have failed, whilst I hope in my God.
68:5 They are multiplied above the hairs of my head, who hate me without cause. My enemies are grown strong who have wrongfully persecuted me: then did I pay that which I took not away.
68:6 O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my offences are not hidden from thee:
68:7 Let not them be ashamed for me, who look for thee, O Lord, the Lord of hosts. Let them not be confounded on my account, who seek thee, O God of Israel.
68:8 Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.
68:9 I am become a stranger to my brethren, and an alien to the sons of my mother.
68:10 For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up: and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.
68:11 And I covered my soul in fasting: and it was made a reproach to me.
68:12 And I made haircloth my garment: and I became a byword to them.
68:13 They that sat in the gate spoke against me: and they that drank wine made me their song.
68:14 But as for me, my prayer is to thee, O Lord; for the time of thy good pleasure, O God. In the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.
68:15 Draw me out of the mire, that I may not stick fast: deliver me from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.
68:16 Let not the tempest of water drown me, nor the deep water swallow me up: and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
68:17 Hear me, O Lord, for thy mercy is kind; look upon me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.
68:18 And turn not away thy face from thy servant: for I am in trouble, hear me speedily.
68:19 Attend to my soul, and deliver it: save me because of my enemies.
68:20 Thou knowest my reproach, and my confusion, and my shame.
68:21 In thy sight are all they that afflict me; my heart hath expected reproach and misery. And I looked for one that would grieve together with me, but there was none: and for one that would comfort me, and I found none.
68:22 And they gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
68:23 Let their table become as a snare before them, and a recompense, and a stumblingblock.
68:24 Let their eyes be darkened that they see not; and their back bend thou down always.
68:25 Pour out thy indignation upon them: and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.
68:26 Let their habitation be made desolate: and let there be none to dwell in their tabernacles.
68:27 Because they have persecuted him whom thou hast smitten; and they have added to the grief of my wounds.
68:28 Add thou iniquity upon their iniquity: and let them not come into thy justice.
68:29 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; and with the just let them not be written.
68:30 But I am poor and sorrowful: thy salvation, O God, hath set me up.
68:31 I will praise the name of God with a canticle: and I will magnify him with praise.
68:32 And it shall please God better than a young calf, that bringeth forth horns and hoofs.
68:33 Let the poor see and rejoice: seek ye God, and your soul shall live.
68:34 For the Lord hath heard the poor: and hath not despised his prisoners.
68:35 Let the heavens and the earth praise him; the sea, and every thing that creepeth therein.
68:36 For God will save Sion, and the cities of Juda shall be built up. And they shall dwell there, and acquire it by inheritance.
68:37 And the seed of his servants shall possess it; and they that love his name shall dwell therein.
