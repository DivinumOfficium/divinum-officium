[Oratio]
Gratiously hear us, O God of our salvation, and grant that as the Birthday of~
thy blessed handmaiden Praxedes doth make us happier, so the fruit of her godly~
earnestness may make us better.
$Per Dominum

[Lectio93]
This Praxedes was a maiden of Rome, and the sister of the maiden Pudentiana.~
When the Emperor Marcus Antoninus was hunting down the Christians, she followed~
them constantly with money, labour, comfort, and every helpful office of~
Christian charity. Some she hid in her house, some she exhorted to firmness in~
professing the faith, of some she buried the bodies. For them that were in~
prison, and them that were toiling in slavery, she supplied every need. At~
last the sight of such butchery of Christians was more than she could bear, and~
she implored God that if it were expedient for her to die, He would release her~
from such suffering. And so upon the 21st day of July she was called away to~
receive the reward of her godly conversation in heaven. Pastor the Priest laid~
her body in the grave of her father (Pudens) and her sister Pudentiana, which~
was in the cemetery of Priscilla, upon the Salarian Way.
