[Oratio]
Grant, we beseech thee, O Almighty God, that we which do keep the birthday of~
thy blessed Virgin Katharine, and. do year by year renew her memorial with~
solemn gladness in thy presence, may likewise be conformed to the pattern of her~
saintly walk with thee.
$Per Dominum

[Lectio4]
This Katharine was a maiden of Sienna, and was born of godly parents, (in the~
year 1347.) She took the habit of the Third Order of St Dominick. Her fasts were~
most severe, and the austerity of her life wonderful. It was discovered that on~
some occasions she took no food at all from Ash Wednesday till Ascension Day,~
receiving all needful strength by taking the Holy Communion. She was engaged~
oftentimes in a wrestling with devils, and was sorely tried by them with divers~
assaults : she was consumed by fevers, and suffered likewise from other~
diseases. Great and holy was the name of Katharine, and sick folk, and such as~
were vexed with evil spirits, were brought to her from all quarters. Through the~
Name of Christ, she had command over sickness and fever, and forced the foul~
spirits to leave the bodies of the tormented.

[Lectio5]
While she dwelt at Pisa, on a certain Lord's Day, after she had received the~
Living Bread Which came down from heaven, she was in the spirit; and saw the~
Lord nailed to the Cross advancing towards her. There was a great light round~
about Him, and five rays of light streaming from the five marks of the Wounds~
in His Feet, and Hands, and Side, which smote her upon the five corresponding~
places in her body. When Katharine perceived this vision, she besought the Lord~
that no marks might become manifest upon her flesh, and straightway the five~
beams of light changed from the colour of blood into that of gold, and touched~
in the form of pure light her feet, and hands, and side. At this moment the~
agony which she felt was so piercing, that she believed that if God had not~
lessened it, she would have died. Thus the Lord in His great love for her, gave~
her this great grace, in a new and twofold manner, namely, that she felt all the~
pain of the wounds, but without there being any bloody marks to meet the gaze of~
men. This was the account given by the handmaiden of God to her Confessor,~
Raymund, and it is for this reason that when the godly wishes of the faithful~
lead them to make pictures of the blessed Katharine, they paint her with golden~
rays of light proceeding from those five places in her body which correspond to~
the five places wherein our Lord was wounded by the nails and spear.

[Lectio6]
The learning which Katharine had was not acquired but inspired. She answered~
Professors of Divinity upon the very hardest questions concerning God. No one~
was ever in her company without going away better. She healed many hatreds, and~
quieted the most deadly feuds. To make peace for the Florentines, who had~
quarrelled with the Church, and were under an Ecclesiastical Interdict, she~
travelled to Avignon, (in 1376) to see the Chief Pontiff Gregory XI. To him she~
showed that she had had revealed to her from heaven his secret purpose of going~
back to Rome, which had been known only to God and himself. It was at her~
persuasion, as well as by his own judgment, that the Pope did in the end return~
to his own See. She was much respected by this Gregory, as well as by his~
successor Urban VI., who even employed her in their embassies. The Bridegroom~
took her home, (upon the 29th day of April, in the year of salvation 1380,) when~
she was about thirty-three years old, after she had given almost countless~
proofs of extraordinary Christian graces, and manifestly displayed the gifts of~
Prophecy and miracles. Pope Pius II. enrolled her among the Virgin Saints.

[Lectio94]
Catharine, a virgin of Siena, born of devout parents, was granted the habit of St. 
Dominic worn by the Sisters of Penance. Her abstinence was most strict, and her whole life was one of marvellous austerity. When she was staying at Pisa on the Lord's Day, refreshed by the Bread of heaven and rapt in ecstasy, she saw the crucified Lord coming with a great light and, from the marks of his wounds, five rays coming down to the same places in her body. Aware of the mystery, she implored the Lord that the wounds would not be visible, and the colour of the rays immediately changed from that of blood to brightness, in the form of pure light touching her hands and feet and heart. But such was the pain she suffered, even though the signs of the bleeding wounds could not be seen, that she believed she would soon have died if God had not lessened it. Her learning was infused, not acquired. She went to Pope Gregory XI at Avignon and shewed him that she knew by divine means of the vow he had made to return to the City, a vow known to God alone, and she was the cause of the Pope's going to occupy in person his See at Rome. In about the thirty-third year of her age she went to her Bridegroom, and Pius II enrolled her among the holy Virgins.
