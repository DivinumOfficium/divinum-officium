[Lectio93]
The holy Abbat Giles was by birth an Athenian, and of Royal lineage. From his~
youth he showed ever such a love for sacred learning and for works of charity,~
that he seemed to care for nothing else. When his father and mother were dead,~
he bestowed his whole inheritance upon the poor. He took off even his own coat,~
to clothe a poor sick man withal, and the sick man was healed forthwith as soon~
as he put it on him. As Giles became famous for working miracles, he fled from~
glory among men, and betook him to Aries, (in France,) to the company of blessed~
Caesarius. After the space of two years he departed thence, and went into the~
desert, for he lived in wonderful holiness for a long while upon the roots of~
herbs and the milk of an hind, which came to him at regular hours. This hind was~
chased one day by the King's hounds, and took refuge in Giles's cave. Thereby~
the King of France was moved earnestly to entreat of him that he would suffer a~
monastery to be built in the place where this cave was. At the instant desire of~
the King, he took the rule of this monastery, albeit himself unwilling, and~
discharged this duty wisely and godly for some years, until he passed away to~
heaven.
