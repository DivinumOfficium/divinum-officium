Lesson from the second book of Samuel
!2 Sam 3:6-10
6 Now while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner the son of Ner ruled the house of Saul.
7 And Saul had a concubine named Respha, the daughter of Aia. And Isboseth said to Abner:
8 Why didst thou go in to my father's concubine? And he was exceedingly angry for the words of Isboseth, and said: Am I a dog's head against Juda this day, who have shown mercy to the house of Saul thy father, and to his brethren and friends, and have not delivered thee into the hands of David, and hast thou sought this day against me to charge me with a matter concerning a woman?
9 So do God to Abner, and more also, unless as the Lord hath sworn to David, so I do to him,
10 That the kingdom be translated from the house of Saul, and the throne of David be set up over Israel, and over Juda from Dan to Bersabee.

!2 Sam 3:12-16
12 Abner therefore sent messengers to David for himself, saying: Whose is the land? and that they should say: Make a league with me, and my hand shall be with thee: and I will bring all Israel to thee.
13 And he said: Very well: I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, saying: Thou shalt not see my face before thou bring Michol the daughter of Saul: and so thou shalt come, and see me.
14 And David sent messengers to Isboseth the son of Saul, saying: Restore my wife Michol, whom I espoused to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.
15 And Isboseth sent, and took her from her husband Phaltiel, the son of Lais.
16 And her husband followed her, weeping as far as Bahurim: and Abner said to him: Go and return. And he returned.

!2 Sam 3:17-21
17 Abner also spoke to the ancients of Israel, saying: Both yesterday and the day before you sought for David that he might reign over you.
18 Now then do it: because the Lord hath spoken to David, saying: By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel from the hands of the Philistines, and of all their enemies.
19 And Abner spoke also to Benjamin. And he went to speak to David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to all Benjamin. ]
20 And he came to David in Hebron with twenty men: and David made a feast for Abner, and his men that came with him.
21 And Abner said to David: I will rise, that I may gather all Israel unto thee my lord the king, and may enter into a league with thee, and that thou mayst reign over all as thy soul desireth. Now when David had brought Abner on his way, and he was gone in peace,
