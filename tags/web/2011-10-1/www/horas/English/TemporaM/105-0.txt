thine, O Lord, is the power * the kingdom is thine. Thou art high above all~
the heathen grant peace in our time, O Lord.

From the second book of the Macchabees
!2 Mac 6:18-22
18 Eleazar one of the chief of the scribes, a man advanced in years, and of a~
comely countenance, was pressed to open his mouth to eat swine's flesh.
19 But he, choosing rather a most glorious death than a hateful life, went~
forward voluntarily to the torment.
20 And considering in what manner he was come to ii;, patiently bearing, he~
determined not to do any unlawful things for the love of life.
21 But they that stood by, being moved with wicked pity, for the old friendship~
they had with the man, taking him aside, desired that flesh might be brought,~
which it was lawful for him to eat, that he might make as if he had eaten, as~
the king had commanded of the flesh of the sacrifice:
22 That by so doing he might be delivered from death: and for the sake of their~
old friendship with the man they did him this courtesy.

!2 Mac 6:23-29
23 But he began to consider the dignity of his age, and his ancient years, and~
the inbred honour of his grey head, and his good life and conversation from a~
child: and he answered without delay, according to the ordinances of the holy~
law made by God, saying, that he would rather be sent into the other world.
24 For it doth not become our age, said he, to dissemble: whereby many young~
persons might think that Eleazar, at the age of fourscore and ten years, was~
gone over to the life of the heathens:
25 And so they, through my dissimulation, and for a little time of a~
corruptible life, should be deceived, end hereby I should bring a stain and a~
curse upon my old age.
26 For though, for the present time, I should be delivered from the punishments~
of men, yet should I not escape the hand of the Almighty neither alive nor dead.
27 Wherefore by departing manfully out of this life, I shall shew myself worthy~
of my old age:
28 And I shall leave an example of fortitude to young men, if with a ready mind~
and constancy I suffer an honourable death, for the most venerable and most holy~
laws. And having spoken thus, he was forthwith carried to execution.
29 And they that led him, and had been a little before more mild, were changed~
to wrath for the words he had spoken, which they thought were uttered out of~
arrogancy.

!2 Mac 7:1-5
1 To came to pass also, that seven brethren, together with their mother, were~
apprehended, and compelled by the king to eat swine's flesh against the law, for~
which end they were tormented with whips and scourges.
2 But one of them, who was the eldest, said thus: What wouldst thou ask, or~
learn of us? we are ready to die rather than to transgress the laws of God,~
received from our fathers.
3 Then the king being angry commanded fryingpans, and brazen caldrons to be~
made hot: which forthwith being heated,
4 He commanded to cut out the tongue of him that had spoken first: and the skin~
of his head being drawn off, to chop off also the extremities of his hands and~
feet, the rest of his brethren, and his mother, looking on.
5 And when he was now maimed in all parts, he commanded him, being yet alive,~
to be brought to the Are, and to be fried in the fryingpan: and while he was~
suffering therein long torments, the rest, together with the mother, exhorted~
one another to die manfully,

From the. Sermons of St Gregory of Nazianzus, (Patriarch of Constantinople.)
!20th. On the Maccabees.
Eleazar was the first-fruits of those who suffered before the coming of Christ,~
even as Stephen was the first-fruits of those who suffered after that coming. He~
was a Priest and an Elder, grey in years, and grey also in wisdom. Once he had~
sacrificed and prayed for the people, but now the time came when he offered~
himself to God as a burnt sacrifice without blemish, a peaceoffering for all the~
people, a blessed beginning in that struggle whereunto his words and his silence~
were alike their exhortation. He presented likewise the bodies of seven children,~
the offspring of his teaching, a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,~
(Rom. xii. 1,) an oblation more glorious and more pure than any legal offering~
for to give the father credit of his children is most meet and right.

There stood the noble and highminded lads, the gallant sons of a noble mother,~
the glorious champions of the truth, men to whom the epoch of Antiochus was an~
anachronism, true disciples of the Law of Moses, straitest of the observers of~
the rites of their forefathers, in that seven-fold number which the Hebrews~
bless, and which is hallowed and worshipful through the reckoning of Sabbath,~
there they stood, with one longing, and one aim, looking to one road to life,~
even to receive death for God's sake, there they stood, brethren in soul not~
less than in body, only covetous one of the other's death. O what a mystery~
They snatched at agony as at treasure, and perilled themselves for the teaching~
of the Law, with no more fear for what was before than regret for what was~
behind. Their dread was but one, even lest any should go uncrowned, lest brother~
should be unwillingly parted from brother, and be saved from the torment of the~
conflict to gain a disastrous victory.

There stood the brave and noble mother, burning with love of her children and of~
God, with her heart rent as few human hearts are riven. Her agony was not so~
much on account of the tortures which her children suffered, as from fear lest~
they should shrink therefrom. She yearned not more over those who left this life~
than she prayed that they who were left might join them her anxiety was for~
the living rather than for the dead. The living were still contending, the dead~
had safely left the field concerning the living she was straitened in not~
knowing how God would receive them, the dead she knew that God had joined unto~
Himself.
