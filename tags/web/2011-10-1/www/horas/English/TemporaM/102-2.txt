From the first book of the Macchabees
!1 Mac  5:1-5
1  Now it came to pass, when the nations round about heard that the altar and the sanctuary were built up as before, that they were exceeding angry.
2  And they thought to destroy the generation of Jacob that were among them, and they began to kill some of the people, and to persecute them.
3  Then Judas fought against the children of Esau in Idumea, and them that were in Acrabathane: because they beset the Israelites around about, and he made a great slaughter of them.
4  And he remembered the malice of the children of Bean: who were a snare and a stumblingblock to the people, by lying in wait for them in the way.
5  And they were shut up by him in towers, and he set upon them, and devoted them to utter destruction, and burnt their towers with fire, and all that were in them.

!1 Mac 5:6-9
6  Then he passed over to the children of Ammon, where he found a mighty power, and much people, and Timotheus was their captain:
7  And he fought many battles with them, and they were discomfited in their sight, and he smote them:
8  And he took the city of Gazer and her towns, and returned into Judea.
9  And the Gentiles that were in Galaad, assembled themselves together against the Israelites that were in their quarters to destroy them: and they fled into the fortress of Datheman.

!1 Mac 5:10-13
10  And they sent letters to Judas and his brethren, saying, The heathens that are round about are gathered together against us, to destroy us:
11  And they are preparing to come, and to take the fortress into which we are fled: and Timotheus is the captain of their host.
12  Now therefore come, and deliver us out of their hands, for many of us are slain.
13  And all our brethren that were in the places of Tubin, are killed: and they have carried away their wives, and their children, captives, and taken their spoils, and they have slain there almost a thousand men.
