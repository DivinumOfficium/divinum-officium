Lesson from the book of Jeremias
!Jer 1:17-19
In those days, the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Gird your loins; stand up and tell Juda all that I command you. Be not crushed on their account, as though I would leave you crushed before them; for it is I this day Who have made you a fortified city, a pillar of iron, a wall of brass, against the whole land; against Juda’s kings and princes, against its priests and people. They will fight against you, but not prevail over you, for I am with you to deliver you, says the Lord.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Mark
!Mark 6:17-29
At that time, Herod had sent and taken John, and bound him in prison, because of~
Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, whom he had married. For John had said to~
Herod, It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife. But Herodias laid~
snares for him, and would have liked to put him to death, but she could not. For~
Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just and holy man, and protected him;~
and when he heard him talk, he did any things, and he liked to hear him. And a~
favorable day came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet to the officials,~
tribunes and chief men of Galilee. And Herodias’ own daughter having come in and~
danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. And the king said to the girl, Ask of~
me what you will, and I will give it to you. And he swore to her, Whatever you~
ask, I will give you, even though it be the half of my kingdom. Then she went~
out and said to her mother, What am I to ask for? And she said, The head of John~
the Baptist. And she came in at once with haste to the king, and asked, saying, I~
want you right away to give me on a dish the head of John the Baptist. And~
grieved as he was, the king because of his oath and his guests, was unwilling to~
displease her. But sending an executioner, he commanded that his head be brought~
on a dish. Then he beheaded him in the prison, and brought his head on a dish,~
and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother. His disciples,~
hearing of it, came and took away his body, and laid it in a tomb.

O Lord, in Your strength the just man is glad; in Your victory how greatly he~
