Lesson from the book of Wisdom
!Wis 5:16-20
But the just live forever, and in the Lord is their recompense, and the thought of them is with the Most High. Therefore shall they receive the splendid kingdom and the beauteous diadem from the hand of the Lord - for He shall shelter them with His right hand, and protect them with His holy arm. He shall take His zeal for armor and He shall arm creation to requite the enemy; He shall don justice for a breastplate and shall wear sure judgment for a helmet; He shall take rectitude as an invincible shield.

V. This is the true brotherhood, which overcame the wickedness of the world; it~
followed Christ, attaining the noble kingdom of heaven. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 11:25-30
At that time Jesus answered and said: I confess to thee, O Father, Lord of~
heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent,~
and hast revealed them to the little ones. Yea, Father; for so hath it seemed~
good in thy sight. All things are delivered to me by my Father. And no one~
knoweth the Son, but the Father: neither doth any one know the Father, but the~
Son, and he to whom it shall please the Son to reveal him. Come to me, all you~
that labour, and are burdened, and I will refresh you. Take up my yoke upon you,~
and learn of me, because I am meek, and humble of heart: and you shall find rest~
to your souls. For my yoke is sweet and my burden light.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 67:36
God is wonderful in his saints: the God of Israel is he who will give power and~
strength to his people. Blessed be God. (Alleluia.)
