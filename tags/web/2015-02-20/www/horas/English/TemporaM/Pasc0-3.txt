From the Holy Gospel according to John.
!John 21:1-14
At that time: After this, Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the sea~
of Tiberias. And he showed himself after this manner. There were together~
Simon Peter, and Thomas, who is called Didymus, And so on.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great.)
!24th on the Gospels.
Dearly beloved brethren, the portion of the Holy Gospel which hath but now been~
read in your ears, knocketh loudly at the door of your heart, with a certain~
question, the answer whereto calleth for thought. This same question is :~
Wherefore did Peter, who had before his conversion been a fisher, wherefore did~
he, after his conversion, again go a-fishing? since the Truth hath said : No man,~
having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of~
God? (Luke ix. 62.) Wherefore did Peter return to that which he had left? But we~
thought we see the answer to his question. The trade which was harmless before~
his conversion, did not become harmful because he had been inverted.

[Responsory1]
R. Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to~
open the Book, and to loose he seven seals thereof.
* Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
V. Worthy is the Lamb That was slain to receive power, and riches, in wisdom,~
and strength, and honour, my glory, and blessing.
R. Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.

[Lectio2]
We know that Peter had been a fisherman, and Matthew a publican, and that Peter~
after his conversion went back to his fishing, but Matthew did not return to the~
receipt of custom. It is one thing to seek a livelihood by fishing, and another~
to amass money by farming of taxes. There are many kinds of business in which it~
is difficult or impossible to be engaged without committing sin, and to such~
kinds of business as these, he which hath once been converted must not again~
betake himself.

[Responsory2]
R. I am the True Vine, and ye are the branches
* He that abideth in Me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit.~
Alleluia, Alleluia.
V. As the Father hath loved Me, so have I loved you.
R. He that abideth in Me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit.~
Alleluia, Alleluia.
&Gloria
R. He that abideth in Me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit.

[Lectio3]
It may likewise be asked why, when the disciples were toiling in the sea, the~
Lord, after His Resurrection, stood on the shore, whereas, before His~
Resurrection, He had walked on the waves before them all. The reason of this is~
quickly known if we will think of the end which it then served. The sea is a~
figure of this present world, tossed to and fro by changing fortune, and~
continually ebbing and flowing with the divers tides of life. The stableness of~
the shore is an image of the never-ending rest of the eternal home. The~
disciples therefore, for that they were yet tossed to and fro upon the waves of a~
dying life, were toiling in the sea, but He our Redeemer, Who had already laid~
aside that which in this body is subject to corruption, and had risen again from~
the dead, He stood upon the shore.

Cast the net on the right side of the ship, * and ye shall find. Alleluia.

[Oratio 2]
O God, Who dost every year fill us with holy gladness for the Again rising of~
the Lord, mercifully grant that these Feast-days which we are now keeping here~
in time, may be to us a mean whereby in the end we may worthily attain unto~
those pleasures which are at thy right hand for evermore

Jesus saith unto His disciples : Bring of the fish which ye have now caught *~
Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fishes. Alleluia.

v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 21:1-14
21:1 AFTER this, Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias. And he shewed himself after this manner.
21:2 There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas, who is called Didymus, and Nathanael, who was of Cana of Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples.
21:3 Simon Peter saith to them: I go a fishing. They say to him: We also come with thee. And they went forth, and entered into the ship: and that night they caught nothing.
21:4 But when the morning was come, Jesus stood on the shore: yet the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.
21:5 Jesus therefore said to them: Children, have you any meat? They answered him: No.
21:6 He saith to them: Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and you shall find. They cast therefore; and now they were not able to draw it, for the multitude of fishes.
21:7 That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved, said to Peter: It is the Lord. Simon Peter, when he heard that it was the Lord, girt his coat about him, (for he was naked,) and cast himself into the sea.
21:8 But the other disciples came in the ship, (for they were not far from the land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.
21:9 As soon then as they came to land, they saw hot coals lying, and a fish laid thereon, and bread.
21:10 Jesus saith to them: Bring hither of the fishes which you have now caught.
21:11 Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fishes, one hundred and fifty-three. And although there were so many, the net was not broken.
21:12 Jesus saith to them: Come, and dine. And none of them who were at meat, durst ask him: Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.
21:13 And Jesus cometh and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish in like manner.
21:14 This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to his disciples, after he was risen from the dead.
