A királyok első könyvéből.
!1 Sam 9:1-4
1 Akkoriban élt Benjamin fiai közt egy Kis nevű ember; Abiel fia volt, Ceror~
fiáé, (aki) Bechoratnak volt a fia, egy Benjamin törzséből való, jómódú embernek,~
Afiachnak a fiáé.
2 Volt egy élte virágjában levő, Saul nevű daliás fia. Izrael fiai közt nem volt~
nála daliásabb: egy fejjel magasabb volt mindenkinél.
3 Történt, hogy Kisnek, Saul apjának elkóboroltak a nőstény szamarai. Ezért Kis~
azt mondta fiának, Saulnak: "Végy magad mellé egy szolgát, aztán kelj útra. Menj,~
és keresd meg a nőstény szamarakat!"
4 Végigpásztázták Efraim egész hegyvidékét és bejárták Salisa egész környékét,~
de nem találták őket. Aztán átfésülték Saalim vidékét, de ott sem voltak. Most~
Benjamin területét járták be, de nem akadtak rájuk.

!1 Sam 8:5-8
5 Amikor Cuf vidékére értek, Saul azt mondta szolgájának, aki elkísérte: "Gyere,~
térjünk vissza, mert atyám már nem a nőstény szamarak miatt, hanem mi miattunk~
kezd el aggódni."
6 De az így felelt: "Ott a városban él Istennek egy embere, tekintélyes ember,~
amit csak mond, az mind valóra válik. Menjünk el hozzá, hátha útbaigazít abban a~
dologban, amelyben járunk."
7 Saul erre azt mondta szolgájának: "Ha netán elmennénk, ugyan mit vinnénk annak~
az embernek. A kenyér kifogyott tarisznyánkból, ajándék nincs nálunk, hogy~
felajánlhatnánk Isten emberének. Mit adhatnánk hát neki?"
8 Ám a szolga megfelelt Saulnak, e szavakkal: "Nézd, még van egy negyed sékel~
ezüstöm. Ezt adom oda Isten emberének, hogy adjon nekünk útbaigazítást."

!1 Sam 9:14-17
14 Fölmentek hát a városba. De épp amikor beléptek a kapun, szembejött velük~
Sámuel -, a magaslati hely felé tartott.
15 Az Úr egy nappal azelőtt, hogy Saul megérkezett, ezt a kinyilatkoztatást adta~
Sámuelnak:
16 "Holnap ebben az időben küldök neked Benjamin hegyvidékéről egy embert. Azt~
kend föl népem, Izrael fejedelmévé. O fogja majd népemet a filiszteusok kezéből~
kiszabadítani. Láttam ugyanis népem nyomorúságát, jajszavuk felhatolt hozzám."
17 Amikor Sámuel észrevette Sault, az Úr nyomban tudtára adta: "Ez az az ember,~
akiről beszéltem neked. O uralkodjék népem fölött."

!From the Encyclical Letter of Pope Pius XI
Among all other proofs of the infinite kindness of our Redeemer, this one is~
especially conspicuous, that, as the love of the Christian believers grew cold,~
he, Divine Love itself, was proposed to be honoured by a special devotion, and~
that the rich treasures of his goodness were thrown wide open by means of that~
form of worship with which we honour the most Sacred Heart of Jesus, "in whom~
are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge." For, as formerly God wished~
to give light to the human race as they came out of Noah's ark by the signal of a~
treaty of friendship, " a bow appearing in the clouds, " so, in those most~
troublous times of a more recent age, when that most subtle of heresies,~
Jansenism, was everywhere creeping in, and enemy of the love of God and of piety,~
preaching that God was not so much to be loved as a father, as to be feared as~
an unrelenting judge, the most kind Jesus manifested unto the nations his most~
Sacred Heart, borne on high like unto a banner of peace and love, an augury of~
certain victory in battle.

[Responsory4]
R. The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him,
* Yea, unto all such as call upon him faithfully.
V. The Lord is full of compassion and mercy, long-suffering and of great~
goodness.
R. Yea, unto all such as call upon him faithfully.

[Lectio5]
Because Our predecessor, Leo XIII, of happy memory, desiring to obtain the~
advantages of such a great devotion to the most Sacred Heart of Jesus, in his~
Encyclical Letter Annum Sacrum most fittingly did not hesitate to proclaim :~
"When the Church, in the early period of her history, was oppressed by the yoke~
of the Caesars, a cross appeared in the heavens to a youthful emperor, which was~
at the same time both the sign and the cause of that most complete victory,~
which was soon to follow. Behold this day another most auspicious and most holy~
sign presented to our eyes : that is to say, the most Sacred Heart of Jesus,~
with a Cross set upon it, shining forth among flames of a most brilliant~
radiance. In this, all our hopes are to be placed ; from this, the salvation of~
mankind is to be asked for and to be awaited."

[Responsory5]
R. I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these~
things from the wise and prudent ;
* Yea, thou hast revealed them unto babes.
V. Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.
R. Yea, thou hast revealed them unto babes.

[Lectio6]
And it is indeed justly so ; for in this most auspicious sign and in that which~
doth follow from it, is there not contained the highest model of piety of the~
whole of religion, and therefore the rule of the more perfect life, inasmuch as~
it leadeth our minds the more easily to a deeper knowledge of Christ the Lord,~
and to a more vehement love of him, and moveth our souls more effectually to a~
more exact imitation of him? Therefore, no one will be surprised, that Our~
predecessors have contínuously vindicated this most approved form of devotion~
from the accusations of objéctors, that they have extolled it with the highest~
praises, and have promoted it with the most ardent zeal, according as~
considerations of the period and of affairs in general have demanded. And it~
hath come to pass by the providence of God, that the devout affection of~
Christ's faithful people towards the most Sacred Heart of Jesus obtaineth daily a~
great increase.

[Responsory6]
R. All nations whom thou hast made shall come
* And they shall worship thee, O Lord.
V. Yea, they shall glorify thy Name, for thou art great, and doest wondrous~
things.
R. And they shall worship thee, O Lord.
&Gloria
R. And they shall worship thee, O Lord.

Evangélium szent János Apostol kőnyvéből
!John 19:31-37
At that time : The Jews, because it was the Preparation, that the bodies should~
not remain upon the cross on the Sabbath Day, for that Sabbath Day was an high~
day, besought Pilate that their legs might broken, and that they might be taken~
away. And so on/
_
A Homily by St. John Chrysostom
!Homilia 85, alias 84 in Joannem, num. 3
See ye not how mighty is the Truth? Through the zeal of the Jews the prophecy is~
fulfilled. And more than one prophecy was fulfilled. For when the soldiers came~
and brake the legs of the others, they brake not the legs of Christ. But yet~
these soldiers, to please the Jews, did pierce his side with a lance, and treat~
his body with contumely. O wicked and accursed crime! But be not troubled,~
beloved, or cast down. They indeed did it in ill-will, but they unwittingly~
contended for the truth, as verily the prophecy foretold : They shall look on~
him whom they have pierced. And more than this, the evil deed served as a~
demonstration even afterwards to those who were without faith, such as Thomas~
and others like him. This ineffable mystery was also consummated to another end :~
Forthwith came there out blood and water. Nor causelessly or by mere chance did~
these fountains flow, but because the Church was founded with Water and Blood.

[Responsory7]
R. If I be lifted up,
* I will draw all men unto me.
V. This he said, signifying what death he should die.
R. I will draw all men unto me.

[Lectio8]
This is well-known to those who have been initiated, namely, to all who have~
been regenerated by the Water, and nourished with the Flesh and Blood, so that~
when thou dost approach to the awesome cup, thou shouldst come as if thou wert~
about to drink from this very side of Christ. And he that saw it bare record,~
and his record is true : as though to say : Not from others have I heard it, but I~
myself was present, and saw it, and therefore my record of it is true. Truly~
indeed doth he thus speak. For he speaketh to us as of an insult, and not as of~
something great and wonderful, else thou mightest doubt his testimony ; but he,~
~(thus shutting the mouth of hereticks, and foretelling future mysteries, and~
mindful of the treasure to be contained in them,) doth enúmerate one by one the~
events as they took place. These things were done that the Scriptures should be~
fulfilled : A bone of him shall not be broken. For even though this was written~
concerning the lamb which the Jews used for their Passover, nevertheless this~
lamb was a figure which came first to shew forth the reality yet to come,~
wherein the prophecy was to be perfectly fulfilled ; and that is why the~
Evangelist quoteth the passage as a prophecy.

[Responsory8]
R. Be ye therefore followers of God ;
* And walk ye therefore in love.
V. For Christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for us.
R. And walk ye therefore in love.
&Gloria
R. And walk ye therefore in love.

[Lectio9]
Since the testimony he himself beareth might not everywhere be held worthy of~
belief, he citeth Moses, to intimate that this thing was not done by chance, but~
had already long ago been foretold in writing. By Moses it was said : A bone of~
him shall not be broken. And again he resteth his faith on the same Prophet :~
These things I have said, saith he, that ye may learn how great is the~
resemblance between the figure and the reality. Seest thou what great care he~
taketh, that what appeareth as disgraceful and ignominious may be believed. For~
that the body should be treated with contempt by the soldier, was far worse than~
its crucifixion. But nevertheless, saith he, I have both said these things, and~
have said them most emphatically, that ye may believe. Let no one, therefore,~
deny credence to these things, nor in shame tamper with our beliefs. For those~
things which seem to be the most dishonouring, are in fact our greatest pride.
