A Makkabeusok elsõ könyvének kezdete
!1 Mac 1:1-7
1 Miután Macedóniai Fülöp fia, Sándor kivonult Chettiimbõl, és legyõzte a~
perzsák és a médek királyát, Dáriust, helyette elõször Hellászon uralkodott,~
királyként.
2 Sok hadjáratot vezetett, erõdöket foglalt el és királyokat küldött halálba.
3 Egészen a föld határáig elõrenyomult, és sok néptõl szedett adót. Az egész~
föld elnémult elõtte. Erre szíve elbizakodottá vált és gõggel telt el.
4 Hatalmas sereget gyûjtött, s uralomra tett szert országok, népek és fejedelmek~
fölött, úgyhogy sorra adófizetõi lettek.
5 De aztán ágynak esett, s tudatára ébredt, hogy meg kell halnia.
6 Maga elé idézte legfõbb embereit, akik vele nõttek fel ifjúkoruktól fogva, és~
még életében felosztotta köztük birodalmát.
7 Sándor tizenkét esztendei uralkodás után meghalt.

[Responsory1]
R. The Lord open your hearts in His law and commandments, and send peace in your~

V. The Lord hear your prayers, and be at one with you, and never forsake you in~
the time of trouble.
R. May He grant you salvation and redeem you out of all evil.

!1 Mac 1:8-11
8 Szolgái vették át az uralmat, ki-ki a maga részén.
9 Halála után mindannyian föltették a diadémot, s utánuk fiaik is, sok éven át.~
Rengeteg bajt hoztak a földre.
10 Istentelen sarj fakadt belõlük, Antiochusz Epifánész, Antiochusz királynak az~
egyik fia. Túsz volt Rómában, s a görög hatalom 137. esztendejében jutott~
uralomra.
11 Azokban a napokban hitehagyottak támadtak Izraelben. Sokak fejét~
telebeszélték javaslatukkal: "Menjünk, és kössünk szövetséget a körülöttünk élõ~
népekkel. Mert amióta elkülönültünk tõlük, rengeteg baj ér bennünket."

[Responsory2]
R. The Lord hear your prayers, and be at one with you, and never forsake you in~
the time of trouble
* Even He, the Lord our God.
V. Give you all an heart to serve Him, and to do His will.
R. Even He, the Lord our God.

!1 Mac 1:12-16
12 Ez a javaslat tetszésre talált.
13 A népbõl néhányan készek voltak rá, hogy elmenjenek a királyhoz. Ez~
felhatalmazta õket, hogy pogány szokásokat vezessenek be.
14 Pogány szokás szerint testgyakorló iskolát létesítettek Jeruzsálemben,~
újranövesztették elõbõrüket,
15 és elpártoltak a szent szövetségtõl. Szövetségre léptek a pogányokkal, s arra~
adták magukat, hogy vétkezzenek.
16 Amikor Antiochusz megszilárdította a birodalmat, arra gondolt, hogy~
Egyiptomra is kiterjeszti hatalmát, hogy így mindkét országon uralkodjék.

[Responsory3]
R. Our enemies are gathered together, and make their boast of their own~
strength. O Lord, break their power, and scatter them
* That they may know that there is none other that fighteth for us, but only~
Thou, O our God!
V. Scatter them in thy strength, and destroy them, O Lord our Shield
R. That they may know that there is none other that fighteth for us, but only~
Thou, O our God
&Gloria
R. That they may know that there is none other that fighteth for us, but only~
Thou, O our God

From the Book upon Duties written by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan).
!Bk. i. ch. 40.
There may perchance be some who are so blinded by the glory of war as to think~
there is no valour but warlike valour, and that the reason why I have taken up~
other subjects is that among us there is no warlike valour whereof to speak. But~
what was the valour of Josue the son of Nun, when in one battle he laid low five~
nations, and took prisoners their kings when he was fighting against the~
Gibeonites, and feared lest the closing in of night should cut short his victory,~
he cried aloud in the greatness of his mind and of his faith, And he said, in~
the sight of Israel Sun stand thou still over against Gibeon, and thou Moon~
over against the valley of Ajalon and the sun stood still, and the moon stayed,~
until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies (Josue x. 12, 13).~
Gideon, with three hundred men, won the victory over the vast people, and the~
savage enemy. The lad Jonathan waxed valiant in fight.

[Responsory4]
R. Be ye not afraid of the assault of the enemy remember how our fathers were~
delivered.
* Now, therefore, let us cry unto heaven, and our God will have mercy upon us.
V.Remember His marvellous works that He hath done unto Pharaoh and his host in~
the Red Sea.
R. Now, therefore, let us cry unto heaven, and our God will have mercy upon us.

[Lectio5]
Shall I speak of the Maccabees But before I speak of them, I will speak of~
their fathers, even of them who, when they were ready to fight for the Temple of~
God and for their own rights, were assailed by a trick of their enemies upon the~
Sabbath day, and were willing rather to offer their bodies naked to the sword~
than to strike back again and break the Sabbath, and so they gave themselves up~
gladly to death but when the Maccabees bethought them that the whole nation~
might thus perish, avenged the innocent blood of their brethren even upon the~
Sabbath day when they were provoked to battle, and afterward, when King~
Antiochus had been stirred up to make war on them by his generals, even Lysias~
and Nicanor and Gorgias, he and his Eastern and Assyrian forces were so crushed~
that forty and eight thousand were laid low on the field by three thousand.

[Responsory5]
R. The heathen are assembled together to fight against us, and we know not what~
we should do.
* Our eyes look unto thee, O Lord our God, that we should not perish.
V. What things they imagine against us, Thou knowest. How shall we be able to~
stand against them, except Thou be our help
R. Our eyes look unto thee, O Lord our God, that we should not perish.

[Lectio6]
What was the valour of Judas the Maccabean leader we may judge by the type of~
one of his men. When Eleazar saw an elephant bigger than the rest, and adorned~
with the King's harness, he thought that the King was riding thereon, and he~
threw himself into the midst of the enemy, and cast away his shield and slew on~
either hand until he was come to the beast, and ran underneath it, and killed it~
with his sword, and so the beast fell upon Eleazar and crushed him, and he died.~
What valour was here To begin with, he feared not to die, and when the enemy~
surrounded him he cast himself into the midst of their ranks, pierced their~
column, and becoming all the fiercer through his mockery of death, he threw away~
his shield and upheld with both hands the huge bulk of the wounded monster~
beneath which he had gone the better to spite it, so that when he died with it~
he might well have been said not so much to be crushed as to be swallowed up in~
victory.

[Responsory6]
R. thine, O Lord, is the power, thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and Thou art~
exalted above all the heathen.
* Give peace in our time, O Lord.
V. O Lord God, Creator of all things, Who art fearful and strong, righteous~
and merciful.
R. Give peace in our time, O Lord.
&Gloria
R. Give peace in our time, O Lord.

[Responsory7]
R. The sun shone upon the shields of gold, and the mountains glistered therewith
* And the army of the heathens was spread abroad.
V. For the army was very great and mighty then Judas and his host drew near~
and entered into battle.
R. And the army of the heathens was spread abroad.
