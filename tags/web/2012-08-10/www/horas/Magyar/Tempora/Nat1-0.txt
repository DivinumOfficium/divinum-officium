[Capitulum Vespera]
!Gal 4:1-2
v. Testvérek: amíg az örökös kiskorú, semmiben sem különbözik a szolgától,~
jóllehet mindennek ura. Gyámok és gondviselõk felügyelete alatt áll, apjától~
meghatározott ideig.
$Deo gratias


[Versum 1]
V. The Word was made flesh, alleluia.
R. And dwelt among us, alleluia.

[Ant 1]
While all things were in quiet silence * and that night was in the midst of her~
swift course, thine Almighty Word, O Lord, leapt down out of thy Royal Throne.

[Oratio]
O Almighty and everlasting God, do Thou order all our actions in conformity with~
thy good pleasure, that through the name of thy well-beloved Son, we may~
worthily abound in all good works.

[Lectio4]
From the Sermons of Pope St Leo (the Great.)
!9th on Christmas.
Dearly beloved brethren, the greatness of God's work, in its breadth and height,~
passeth the power of man's utterance; and, therefore, when we must needs not~
keep silence, we find it hard to know what to say. The words of the ProphetWho~
shall declare His generation? (Isa. liii. 8) look not only to the Divine, but~
also to the human birth of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Faith believeth, but~
words cannot explain, how the two natures were joined in one Person, and therein~
we find that we shall never lack matter of praise in Him, Whose abundance ever~
outrunneth the power of our expression.

[Responsory4]
@Sancti/12-25:Responsory5

[Lectio5]
Therefore let us rejoice, that this mystery of mercy is greater than we can ever~
speak; and let us feel that it is good for us to fail if we try to express the~
height and depth of redeeming love. He cometh nearest to the knowledge of the~
truth, who, the farther he advanceth, seeth all the more clearly that he can~
never overtake that whereafter he searcheth. For he that imagineth therein that~
he hath ever attained unto the goal, hath not found that which he seeketh, but~
hath altogether missed.

[Responsory5]
@Sancti/12-25:Responsory6

[Lectio6]
But lest we should be confounded at the weakness of our mortality, we have help~
in the words of the Prophets and Evangelists; and they are able so to inflame~
and teach us that we may see the Birth of the Lord, wherein the Word was made~
Flesh, not so much as a thing past, as a thing present. The proclamation of the~
angel to the shepherds who watched their flocks by night, ringeth in our ears~
also; and for this end are we appointed to rule the Lord's flock, that we may~
ever keep in our heart the word revealed from heaven, and say unto you, as we do~
this day Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all~
people; for unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, Which is~
Christ the Lord!

!Luke 2:33-40
Azon idõben Jézus apja és anyja csodálkoztak azon, amit fiukról mondott. És így~
tovább.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!Bk. ii. on Luke ii.
We see that God's abounding grace is poured forth on all by the birth of the~
Lord, and that the gift of prophecy is not denied to the righteous, but to the~
unbelieving. Simeon prophesieth that our Lord Jesus Christ is set for the fall~
and rising again of many in Israel, setting forth that the just and the unjust~
reap different fruits from the coming of the Saviour; so will it be with us;~
according to our individual works will the True and Just Judge apportion to us~
punishment or reward.

[Responsory7]
@Sancti/12-25:Responsory8

[Lectio8]
See, a sword shall pierce through thine own soul also. We have no record or~
tradition that Mary left this world by suffering a violent death, and the~
material sword can pierce the body only, and not the soul. Wherefore here we see~
the wisdom of Mary in that she was not ignorant of the heavenly mysteries. For,~
the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword,~
piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and~
marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart for all~
things are naked and opened unto the eyes of the Son of God, from Whom also~
the secret things of our conscience are not hidden.

[Responsory8]
R. How is the King of heaven attended? He that containeth the world is laid in a~
stable
* Lying in a manger, reigning in heaven.
V. Unto us is born, this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, Which is Christ~
the Lord.
R. Lying in a manger, reigning in heaven.
&Gloria
R. Lying in a manger, reigning in heaven.

[Lectio9]
There had been a triple prophecy; the prophecy of Simeon had followed the~
prophecy of the virgin, and the prophecy of the wife; those, namely, of Mary and~
Elizabeth. And now ought the widow also to prophesy, that no sex nor state might~
be wanting. And Anna is brought before us with such a title from her widowhood~
and her life, that we may well believe that she received the grace to announce~
the Advent of the Redeemer. In our exhortation addressed to widows we have~
already treated of her gifts at length, and, as we have much matter before us,~
we will not now again enter on the subject.
