Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to Titus
!Titus 2:11-15
Beloved: The grace of God our Savior has appeared to all men, instructing us, in order that, rejecting ungodliness and worldly lusts, we may live temperately and justly and piously in this world; looking for the blessed hope and glorious coming of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, Who gave Himself for us that He might redeem us from all iniquity and cleanse for Himself and acceptable people, pursuing good works. Thus speak, and exhort, in Christ Jesus our Lord.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 2:1-14
At that time, there went forth a decree from Caesar Augustus that a census of~
the whole world should be taken. This first census took place while Cyrinus was~
governor of Syria. And all were going, each to his own town, to register. And~
Joseph also went from Galilee out of the town of Nazareth into Judea to the town~
of David, which is called Bethlehem - because he was of the house and family of~
David - to register, together with Mary his espoused wife, who was with child.~
And it came to pass while they were there, that the days for her to be delivered~
were fulfilled. And she brought forth her firstborn Son, and wrapped Him in~
swaddling clothes, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them~
in the inn. And there were shepherds in the same district living in the fields~
and keeping watch over their flock by night. And behold, an angel of the Lord~
stood by them and the glory of God shone round about them, and they feared~
exceedingly. And the angel said to them, Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring~
you good news of great joy which shall be to all the people; for today in the~
town of David a Savior has been born to you, Who is Christ the Lord. And this~
shall be a sign to you: you will find an Infant wrapped in swaddling clothes and~
lying in a manger. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the~
heavenly host praising God and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth~
peace among men of good will.
