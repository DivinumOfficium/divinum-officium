[Lectio93]
From the Sermons sancti Augustini Episcopi.
!Serm. 47. of Sancti.
Dearly beloved brethren, as often as we keep the Feasts of the holy Martyrs, we~
look to obtain of the Lord, by their intercession, such good things in this life~
that thereby we, following them, may gain better in that which is to come. For~
they only do truly keep Holiday on the Feasts of the Martyrs, who follow after~
the Martyrs' example. These Feasts of the Martyrs are the Martyrs' preaching,~
whereby to stir us up to imitate what we are not loath to honour.
