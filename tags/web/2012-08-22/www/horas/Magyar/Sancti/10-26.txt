Mercyfully consider our weakness, O Almighty God, and whereas by the burden of~
our sins we are sore let Evarist your Martyr be mercifully pleased to deliver us~
from all things which may hurt our bodies, and from all evil thoughts which may~
defile our souls

[Lectio93]
Evaristus was by birth a Greek Jew, and held the Popedom in the reign of the~
Emperor Trajan. He it was who divided among the Priests the titles of the~
Churches in the city of Rome, and commanded that seven Deacons should attend the~
Bishop when he was executing his office of Gospel preaching. He it was who~
commanded, in accordance with the tradition of the Apostles, that marriages~
should be celebrated openly, and that a Priest should be asked to invoke a~
blessing thereon. He ruled the Church for nine years and three months. He held~
four Ordinations in the month of December, wherein he ordained seventeen Priests,~
two Deacons, and fifteen Bishops. Having finished his testimony, he was buried~
upon the Vatican, hard by the grave of the Prince of the Apostles, upon the 26th~
day of October, (in the year of our Lord 112.)
