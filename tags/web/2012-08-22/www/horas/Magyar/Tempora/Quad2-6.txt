Evangélium szent Lukács könyvébõl
!Luke 15:11-32
Azon idõben mondá Jézus a farizeusoknak és írástudóknak: Egy embernek volt két~
fia. A fiatalabbik egyszer így szólt apjához: Apám, add ki nekem az örökség rám~
esõ részét És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!Bk. vii. Comment, on Luke xv.
Thou seest how that the heavenly goods are given to such as seek them. Neither~
oughtest thou to think the father to blame, because he gave to his younger son.~
In the kingdom of God there is no age of weakness, neither doth faith wax infirm~
with years. He, surely, who asked, deemed himself of sufficient age. And would~
that he had not left his father! then had he been ignorant of the obstacle of~
his age! But after that he had left his father's house, and had gone into a far~
country, he began to be in want. Well is he said to have wasted his substance,~
who hath cut himself off from the Church!

[Responsory1]
R. Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee, and am no more worthy~
to be called thy son.
* Make me as one of thine hired servants.
V. How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I~
perish with hunger! I will arise and go to my father and will say unto him
R. Make me as one of thine hired servants.

[Lectio2]
He took his journey into a far country. No man can go farther than to abandon~
his own better self, to leave, not his country, but his morals, and, as it were,~
in an hideous fever of lust after the world, to divorce himself from the ties~
that bind him to holy things. Yea, he that turneth his back on Christ, banisheth~
himself from his Fatherland, and becometh a citizen of the world. But we are no~
more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the~
household of God, since we who sometimes were afar off, are made nigh by the~
Blood of Christ. (Eph. ii. 19, 13.) Let us not envy the pleasures of them who~
remain in the far country. We too have once been there, but, as saith Isaiah,~
they that dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light~
shined. (ix. 2.) And that far country is the land of the shadow of death.

But we to whom the Lord Christ is the breath of life, are alive under the shadow~
of Christ. And therefore it is that the Church saith I sat down under His~
shadow with great delight. (Cant. ii. 3.) The prodigal son by riotous living~
wasted all the gifts of nature. Take warning, O thou who art made in the image~
and likeness of God, lest thou waste the same by brutish wallowing. Thou art the~
work of God; say not to a stock Thou art my father, (Jer. ii. 27,) lest thou~
grow into the likeness of a stock, as it is written They that make them are~
like unto them. (Ps. cxiii. 16.)

I will arise and go to my father, * and will say unto him Make me as one of~

[Oratio 2]
Grant, O Lord, we beseech thee, that our Fasts may bring forth their fruit unto~
salvation, that so the affliction which we lay upon our bodies may quicken our~
souls unto spiritual increase.

Dixit autem pater * ad servos suos: Cito proferte stolam primam, et induite~
