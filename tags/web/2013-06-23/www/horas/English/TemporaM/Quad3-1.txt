From the holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 4:23-30
In that time Jesus said to the pharisees: Doubtless you will say to me this~
similitude: Physician, heal thyself: as great things as we have heard done in~
Capharnaum, do also here in thy own country. And so on.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!Bk. iv. on Luke iv.
Here we have a display of a spite not very common. Their hatred of Christ, and~
their desire to find grounds for that hatred in what in Him appealed for their~
love, had made them forget their local friendliness to a fellow-citizen. By this~
example as well as by God's declaration, thou mayest learn that thou wilt wait~
in vain to be holpen of His mercy, whilst thou art envious of the spiritual good~
of thy neighbour. Yea, the Lord turneth Him away from the envious, and will not~
show the mighty works of His power to such as are bitter against His gifts to~
others. The example of Himself which God hath been pleased to set before us is~
that of His doings in the Flesh, and it is by these His doings which He suffered~
to be seen, that we are taught touching those which are unseen.

[Responsory1]
R. Take hence presents with you, and go unto the lord of the land, and when ye~
be come into his presence, bow yourselves to him to the earth.
* And my God give you mercy before the man, that he may send away again this~
your brother, and him which he keepeth in ward.
V. Take of the best fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a~
present.
R. And my God give you mercy before the man, that he may send away again this~
your brother, and him which he keepeth in ward.

[Lectio2]
The Saviour then doth not lightly excuse Himself that He had wrought none of His~
mighty works in His own country, lest perchance any should thence learn to think~
lightly of our duty to love our Fatherland. Neither was it possible that He Who~
loved all, should not love His own countrymen; they it was who failed in that~
love because of their very envy. I tell you of a truth, many widows were in~
Israel in the days of Elias. The days of Elias not that the said days belonged~
to Elias, but either because those were the days when Elias lived and worked; or,~
else, this is a mystic phrase, meaning that Elias by his works made many souls~
to awake spiritually from the night of sin to the day of grace, and turn to the~
Lord. In this latter sense that holy Prophet was a mean whereby heaven was~
opened to such as looked to the eternal and mysterious things of God, and again~
was shut, (and there was a famine,) when there were no means of knowing God~
through outward ordinances. This subject, however, I have treated before at full~
length, when I was writing on the subject of widows.

[Responsory2]
R. Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? God be gracious unto~
thee, my son.
* And he made haste, and entered into the house, and wept there, for his tears~
brake forth, and he could not refrain himself.
V. And Joseph lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, and his bowels~
yearned upon his brother.
R. And he made haste, and entered into the house, and wept there, for his tears~
brake forth, and he could not refrain himself.

[Lectio3]
And many lepers were in Israel in the days of Eliseus the Prophet, and none of~
them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian. By these words of the Lord our~
great Physician, we are plainly taught and urged to put our trust in the~
Adorable God, since we see that none was healed, or cleansed from bodily plague -~
spots, save him who took a religious means to regain health. For the blessings~
of God are not given to them who close their eyes in sleep, but to them that~
look to Him. We have remarked in our other book, (alluded to above,) that the~
widow to whom Elias was sent was a type of the Church. And next after (the~
mention of the type of) the Church cometh meetly the (mention of him who was a~
type of the Gentile) people, (her converts.) Yea, the Gentiles were a people~
foreigners by birth, leprous, and covered with plague-spots, till they were~
baptized in the stream (of the) mystic (Jordan;) but from the sacramental waters~
they rise, lepers no more, but cleansed in body and soul, a glorious virgin~
Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing. (Eph. v. 27.)

[Responsory3]
R. Joseph said unto his eleven brethren I am Joseph whom ye sold into Egypt;~
is our father yet alive, the old man of whom ye spake unto me?
* Go, bring him down unto me, that he may live.
V. For these two years hath the famine been in the land; and yet there are five~
years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest.
R. Go, bring him down unto me, that he may live.
&Gloria
R. Go, bring him down unto me, that he may live.

[Ant 2]
Amen I say unto you, * No Prophet is accepted in his own country

[Oratio 2]
O Lord, we beseech thee mercifully to shed abroad thy grace into our hearts,~
that we who are now denying carnal meats to our bodily cravings, may have power~
likewise to withhold from the same all yielding to the deathful lusts of sin.
$Per Dominum

[Ant 3]
But Jesus, * passing through the midst of them, went His way.

[Oratio 3]
Let our help, O Lord, be in thy mercy, that we over whom thy wrath doth most~
justly hang because of our sins, may in all dangers worthily be shielded by thy~
protection and delivered by thy salvation.

v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 4:23-30
4:23 And he said to them: Doubtless you will say to me this similitude: Physician, heal thyself: as great things as we have heard done in Capharnaum, do also here in thy own country.
4:24 And he said: Amen I say to you, that no prophet is accepted in his own country.
4:25 In truth I say to you, there were many widows in the days of Elias in Israel, when heaven was shut up three years and six months, when there was a great famine throughout all the earth.
4:26 And to none of them was Elias sent, but to Sarepta of Sidon, to a widow woman.
4:27 And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet: and none of them was cleansed but Naaman the Syrian.
4:28 And all they in the synagogue, hearing these things, were filled with anger.
4:29 And they rose up and thrust him out of the city; and they brought him to the brow of the hill, whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong.
4:30 But he passing through the midst of them, went his way.
