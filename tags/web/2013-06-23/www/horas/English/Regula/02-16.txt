02-16# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 13: How Lauds Are to Be Said On Ferias. Continued.

But when it is Lauds or Vespers that are to be recited, let them not on any occasion conclude without the Lord’s prayer being said at the end, by the superior, audibly, on account of the thorns of scandal that are wont to arise, that those present may purge themselves of evil of this sort through that petition of the prayer in which they say: “Forgive us as we also forgive.” And when other offices are to be recited, let the past part of that prayer be said aloud, that by all answer may be made: “But deliver us from evil.”
