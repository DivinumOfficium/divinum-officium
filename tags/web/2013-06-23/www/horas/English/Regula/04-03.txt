04-03# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 52: of the Oratory of the Monastery
_
Let the oratory be an oratory and nothing else, nor let anything be kept or anything be done there that is incongruous. As soon as the Work of God is finished let all reverently leave the oratory, in complete silence, so that any brother who by chance wishes to pray individually may not be hindered by another’s misconduct. And if by chance one wishes to pray somewhat more privately, let him enter without affection and pray, not with audible outcry but by heartfelt penitence. Therefore he who is not so occupied, let him not be permitted to linger in the oratory after office, as has already been said, lest another’s hindrance ensue.
