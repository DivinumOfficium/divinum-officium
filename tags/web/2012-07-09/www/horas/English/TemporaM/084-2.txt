From the Book of Ecclesiasticus
!Sir 2:1-3
1 Son, when thou comest to the service of God, stand in justice and in fear, and~
prepare thy soul for temptation.
2 Humble thy heart, and endure: incline thy ear, and receive the words of~
understanding: and make not haste in the time of clouds.
3 Wait on God with patience: join thyself to God, and endure, that thy life may~
be increased in the latter end.

!Sir 2:4-6
4 Take all that shall be brought upon thee: and in thy sorrow endure, and in thy~
humiliation keep patience.
5 For gold and silver are tried in the fire, but acceptable men in the furnace~
of humiliation.
6 Believe God, and he will recover thee: and direct thy way, and trust in him.~
Keep his fear, and grow old therein.

!Sir 2:7-12
7 Ye that fear the Lord, wait for his mercy: and go not aside from him, lest ye~
fall.
8 Ye that fear the Lord, believe him: and your reward shall not be made void.
9 Ye that fear the Lord, hope in him: and mercy shall come to you for your~
delight.
10 Ye that fear the Lord, love him, and your hearts shall be enlightened.
11 My children behold the generations of men: and know ye that no one hath hoped~
in the Lord, and hath been confounded.
12 For who hath continued in his commandment, and hath been forsaken? or who~
hath called upon him, and he despised him?
