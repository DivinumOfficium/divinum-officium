[Capitulum Vespera]
!Wis 5:1
v. Then shall the just stand with great constancy against those that have afflicted them, and taken away their labours.
$Deo gratias

[Hymnus Vespera]
v. While Christ's disciples, grieving, sad,
Their master's painful death deplore,
Whom faithless servants' cruel hands,
Had bathed in his own crimson gore;
_
Quick from the happy realms above,
An angel comes on joyful wing,
And to the women tells the joy
That to his flock their Lord will bring.
_
As they with eager steps make haste,
Their joyous message to repeat,
Their master's glorious form they see,
And falling clasp his sacred feet.
_
Cheered by this tale, his faithful flock
The Galilean mount ascend,
And there with loving awe behold
Their heart's sole wish, their truest friend.
_
That thou mayst be our Paschal joy
Through happy, never-ending years,
thine own poor children, Jesu, free
From sin's sad death with all its fears.
_
* To God the Father, and the Son,
Who rose from death, glad praise repeat;
Let equal praise be ever sung
To God the Holy Paraclete.
Amen.

[Lectio4]
From the Sermons of Pope St Gregory the Great
!Sermon 30 th on the Gospels.
It is written " By His Spirit the Lord hath garnished the heavens." Now the garniture of the heavens are the godly powers of preachers, and this garniture, what it is, Paul teacheth us thus " To one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit to another faith by the same Spirit to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit, to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another divers kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. But all these worketh that one and the self-same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will.

[Responsory4]
R. Eternal light will shine over your saints O Lord
* And the eternity of the times, alleluia, alleluia
V. Everlasting joy shall be upon their heads, they shall obtain joy and gladness
R. And the eternity of the times, alleluia, alleluia

[Lectio5]
So much power then as have preachers, so much garniture have the heavens. Wherefore again it is written "By the word of the Lord were the heavens made."~
~(Ps. xxxii. 6.) For the Word of the Lord is the Son of the Father. But, to the end that all the Holy Trinity may be made manifest as the Maker of the heavens, that is, of the Apostles, it is straightway added touching God the Holy Ghost: u and all the host of them by the Breath of His mouth." Therefore the might of the same heavens is the might of the Spirit, for they had not braved the powers of this world, unless the strength of the Holy Ghost had comforted them. For we know what manner of men the Teachers of the Holy Church were before the coming of this Spirit and since He came we see in Whose strength they are made strong.

[Responsory5]
R. With great power did the Apostles
* Give testimony of the resurrection of Jesus Christ our Lord, alleluia, alleluia.
V. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost: and they spoke the word of God with confidence.
R. Give testimony of the resurrection of Jesus Christ our Lord, alleluia, alleluia.

[Lectio6]
Verily if we ask of the damsel that kept the door, she will tell us what was the measure of weakness and of strength in that Shepherd of the Church nigh to whose most holy body we are now sitting, before that the Spirit came. He was so stricken by the words of one woman, that for fear of death, he denied Life. And we may well remember that Peter denied in captivity Him, Whom the thief confessed, even when He was lifted up upon the Cross. But let us hear what that craven was after that the Spirit came. When the rulers and elders were gathered together, the Apostles were beaten, and commanded not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. And Peter answered with great boldness, "We ought to obey God rather than men."

[Responsory6]
R. These are the young lambs, who were promised, they are just coming to the fountains.,
* They are filled with glory, alleluia, alleluia.
V. in sight of the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands.

[Hymnus Laudes]
v. With the fair sun of Easter morn
The world's excelling joy is born,
When, bright with new and greater grace,
The Apostles see the Saviour's face.
_
They in their Lord's fair flesh descry
The wounds that shine as stars on high,
And, wondering, faithful witness bear,
And all that they have seen declare.
_
O Christ, most loving King, we pray,
Possess our inmost hearts today,
While grateful lips with glad acclaim
Sing fervent praises to thy name.
_
Lord Jesu, that thou mayest be
Our Easter joy eternally,
Our souls from death of sin set free
That they, new born, may live to thee.
_
* To God the Father, and the Son,
From death arisen, praise be done:
With God the Holy Ghost on high
Henceforth to all eternity.
Amen. 

[HymnusM Laudes]
In this our bright and Paschal day
The sun shines out  with purer ray,
When Christ, to earthly sight made plain,
The glad Apostles see again.
_
The wounds, the riven wounds He shows
In that His flesh with light that glows,
In loud accord both far and nigh
The Lord's arising testify.
_
O Christ, the King Who lovest to bless,
Do Thou our hearts and souls possess;
To Thee our praise that we may pay,
To Whom our praise is due for aye.
_
We pray Thee, King with glory decked,
In this our Paschal joy, protect
From all that death would fain effect
Thy ransomed flock, Thine own elect.
_
To Thee Who, dead, again dost live,
All glory, Lord, Thy people give;
All glory, as is ever meet,
To Father and to Paraclete.
Amen.
