04-22# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 65: Concerning the Provost of the Monastery
_
It happens and indeed somewhat often that grave scandals arise in monasteries through the appointment of a provost, since some there are who, puffed up with malignant spiritual pride, esteeming themselves to be second abbots and assuming to themselves tyrannical power, foster scandals and cause dissensions in the community and especially in those places where the provost himself also is appointed by the same prelate or by the same abbots who appoint the abbot. And it is easy to discover how absurd is such a method of appointment, because from the very first moment of his appointment there is presented to him an incentive to pride in that it is suggested to him by his own thoughts that he is now freed from the authority of his abbot, because “thou hast been appointed by the very same persons by whom the abbot also was appointed.” Hence are stirred up envies, quarrels, detractions, dissensions, jealousies, disorders; and while the abbot and the provost are at variance with one another their souls under this dissension are of necessity endangered; and those who are subject to them through taking sides travel the road to ruin. And the blame for this danger rests primarily upon the authors of such an arrangement.
