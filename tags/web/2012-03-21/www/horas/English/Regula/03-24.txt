03-24# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 44: Concerning Such As Are Excommunicated, How They May Make Satisfaction
_
Let him who for grave faults is excommunicated from the oratory and table lie prostrate outside the door of the oratory, while the Work of God is proceeding within the oratory, saying nothing but only lying prone with head touching the ground and towards the feet of those leaving the oratory. And this let him continue to do until such time as the abbot shall adjudge satisfaction has been made: and when at length he comes in, at the abbot’s command, let him prostrate at the feet of the abbot and then at the feet of all the brethren that they may pray for him. And then, if the abbot have so ordered, let him be received in choir; but as to his place in choir let it be as the abbot may order, on the understanding however that he presume not to recite in the oratory psalm or lection or anything else, unless the abbot give further order: and at all the hours as soon as the Work of God is finished let him cast himself to the ground in the place where he stands and so let him make satisfaction, until the abbot give him further order to cease from this making satisfaction.

But as to those who for lighter faults are excommunicated from table only, let them make satisfaction in the oratory according as the abbot shall command and let them continue until he give them benediction and say, “It is enough.”
