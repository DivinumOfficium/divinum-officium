04-25# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 67: Concerning Brethren Sent On a Journey
_
Let brethren about to be sent on a journey commend themselves to the prayers of the abbot and all the brethren; and let there always be a commemoration made of all absent brethren at the end of the prayer of the Work of God. And let brethren returning from a journey on the very day on which they return, lying prostrate on the floor of the oratory throughout all the canonical hours while the Work of God is being fulfilled, seek prayers from all on account of transgressions, lest perchance there shall have happened to any one of them on the way the seeing or hearing of any evil thing or idle word. And by no means let any one of them presume to relate to another anything whatsoever that he may have seen or heard outside the monastery, because it is very distracting. But if anyone shall have thus presumed, let him be subjected to the punishment prescribed by rule. Similarly let it be done to him also who shall have presumed to leave the monastery enclosure, or to go anywhere at all, or to do anything whatsoever, however small, without the abbot’s orders.
