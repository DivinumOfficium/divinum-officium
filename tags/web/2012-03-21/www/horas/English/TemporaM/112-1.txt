[Lectio1]
From the Prophet Ezechiel
!Ezek  33:1-5
1  And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
2  Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say to them: When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man, one of their meanest, and make him a watchman over them:
3  And he see the sword coming upon the land, and sound the trumpet, and tell the people:
4  Then he that heareth the sound of the trumpet, whosoever he be, and doth not look to himself, if the sword come, and cut him off: his blood shall be upon his own head.
5  He heard the sound of the trumpet and did not look to himself, his blood shall be upon him: but if he look to himself, he shall save his life.

7  Their feet were straight feet, and the sole of their foot was like the sole of a calf's foot, and they sparkled like the appearance of glowing brass.
8  And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides: and they bad faces, and wings on the four sides,

!Ezek 1:9-11
9  And the wings of one were joined to the wings of another. They turned not when they went: but every one went straight forward.
10  And as for the likeness of their faces: there was the face of a man, and the face of a lion on the right side of all the four: and the face of an ox, on the left side of all the four: and the face of an eagle over all the four.
11  And their faces, and their wings were stretched upward: two wings of every one were joined, and two covered their bodies:
