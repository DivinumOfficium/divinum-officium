From the Book of Genesis
!Gen 12:1-6
1 And the Lord said to Abram: Go forth out of thy country, and from thy kindred,~
and out of thy father's house, and come into the land which I shall show thee.
2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and magnify thy~
name, and thou shalt be blessed.
3 I will bless them that bless thee, and curse them that curse thee, and in thee~
shall all the kindred of the earth be blessed:
4 So Abram went out as the Lord had commanded him, and Lot went with him: Abram~
was seventy-five years old when he went forth from Haran.
5 And he took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all the substance~
which they had gathered, and the souls which they had gotten in Haran: and they~
went out to go into the land of Chanaan. And when they were come into it,
6 Abram passed through the country into the place of Sichem, as far as the noble~
vale: now the Chanaanite was at that time in the land.

[Responsory1]
R. The Lord spake unto Abram, saying Get thee out of thy country, and from thy~
kindred, and go unto the land that I will show thee
* And I will make of thee a great nation.
V. I will surely bless thee and make thy name great, and thou shalt be blessed.
R. And I will make of thee a great nation.

[Lectio2]
!Gen 12:7-13
7 And the Lord appeared to Abram, and said to him: To thy seed will I give this~
land. And he built there an altar to the Lord, who had appeared to him.
8 And passing on from thence to a mountain, that was on the east side of Bethel,~
he there pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east; he~
built there also an altar to the Lord, and called upon his name.
9 And Abram went forward, going, and proceeding on to the south.
10 And there came a famine in the country; and Abram went down into Egypt, to~
sojourn there: for the famine was very grievous in the land.
11 And when he was near to enter into Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife: I know~
that thou art a beautiful woman:
12 And that when the Egyptians shall see thee, they will say: She is his wife:~
and they will kill me, and keep thee.
13 Say, therefore, I pray thee, that thou art my sister: that I may be well used~
for thee, and that my soul may live for thy sake.

[Responsory2]
R. Abraham stood by the oak of Mamre, and he saw three men coming up by the~
path.
* He saw three, and worshipped One.
V. Behold, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name~
Isaac.
R. He saw three, and worshipped One.

[Lectio3]
!Gen 12:14-19
14 And when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians saw the woman that she was~
very beautiful.
15 And the princes told Pharao, and praised her before him: and the woman was~
taken into the house of Pharao.
16 And they used Abram well for her sake. And he had sheep and oxen, and he~
asses, and men servants and maid servants, and she asses, and camels.
17 But the Lord scourged Pharao and his house with most grievous stripes for~
Sarai, Abram's wife.
18 And Pharao called Abram, and said to him: What is this that thou hast done to~
me? Why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19 For what cause didst thou say, she was thy sister, that I might take her to~
my wife? Now, therefore, there is thy wife, take her, and go thy way.

[Responsory3]
R. The Lord did tempt Abraham, and said unto him
* Take thy son Isaac whom thou lovest, and offer him there for a burnt-offering~
upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
V. And when the Lord called him, he answered Behold, here I am. And the Lord~
said unto him
R. Take thy son Isaac whom thou lovest, and offer him there for a burnt-offering~
upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
&Gloria
R. Take thy son Isaac whom thou lovest, and offer him there for a burnt-offering~
upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.

[Lectio4]
From the Book upon the Patriarch Abraham written by St Ambrose, Bishop (of~
Milan.)
!Bk. i. 2.
Abraham was truly a great man, illustrious as an example of many virtues; one~
the like of whom the day-dreams of Philosophy have not been able to produce.~
That which she imagineth is less than that which he did; his simple truth and~
faith were something grander than her lying rounded periods. Let us then~
consider what this man's loyalty was. For that virtue is first to be taken which~
was the source of all the others, and thus this was the first which God called~
for from him, when He said: Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred,~
and from thy father's house. It would have been enough to have said, Get thee~
out of thy country, for there were his kindred, and there his father's house.

[Responsory4]
R. The Angel of the Lord called unto Abraham and said
* Lay not thine hand upon the lad; for now I know that thou fearest God.
V. And Abraham stretched forth his hand to slay his son; and, behold, the Angel~
of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said
R. Lay not thy hand upon the lad; for now I know that thou fearest God.

[Lectio5]
But He gave the details of his sacrifice one by one, that He might see whether~
he loved Him, lest also he should begin rashly, or should seek to evade the~
heavenly commandment. But as the whole of the precept was plainly set forth,~
lest anything should be unconsidered, so also were the rewards set forth, lest~
the burden should seem hopeless. He was tried as one that is strong, he was~
roused as one that is true, he was called as one that is righteous; and he~
departed loyally as the Lord had spoken unto him. And Lot went forth with him.~
That saying of the Seven Wise Men of Greece is much spoken of Follow God. But~
this did Abraham before the Seven Wise Men were thought of; he followed God, and~
went out of his own land.

[Responsory5]
R. The Angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time
* And said I will bless thee, and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the~
heaven.
V. thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies, and in thy seed shall all the~
nations of the earth be blessed.
R. And I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven.

[Lectio6]
But, forasmuch as Abraham had before had another country, namely, the land of~
the Chaldees, whence went forth Terah the father of Abraham, and came unto Haran,~
and forasmuch as he to whom it had been said, Get thee out from thy kindred,~
took Lot, his brother's son, with him, let us consider whether this Get thee out~
of thy country signifieth not get thee out of this earthly dwelling, namely, our~
body, from which Paul came forth, who said, Our conversation is in heaven.~
~(Phil. iii. 20.)

[Responsory6]
R. O God of my master Abraham, prosper my way which I go
* That I may return again in safety unto the house of my master.
V. O Lord, I pray thee, be merciful unto thy servant
R. That I may return again in safety unto the house of my master.
&Gloria
R. That I may return again in safety unto the house of my master.

[Lectio7]
From the holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 18:31-43
In that time Jesus took unto him the twelve, and said to them: Behold, we go up~
to Jerusalem, and all things shall be accomplished which were written by the~
prophets concerning the Son of man. And so on.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great.)
!2nd on the Gospels.
Our Redeemer, foreseeing that the minds of His disciples would be troubled by~
His suffering, told them long before both of the pains of that suffering, and of~
the glory of His rising again, to the end that, when they should see Him die as~
He had prophesied, they might not doubt that He was likewise to rise again. But,~
since His disciples were yet carnal, and could not receive the words telling of~
this mystery, He wrought a miracle before them. A blind man received his sight~
before their eyes, that if they could not receive heavenly things by words, they~
might be persuaded of heavenly things by deeds.

[Responsory7]
R. I came this day unto the well, and I besought the Lord, and said
* O Lord God of Abraham, Thou hast prospered my way.
V. Therefore the virgin to whom I shall say Give me water of thy pitcher to~
drink; and she shall say to me Drink, my lord, and I will give thy camels drink~
also; let the same be the woman whom the Lord hath appointed out for my master's~
son.
R. O Lord God of Abraham,

[Lectio8]
But, dearly beloved brethren, we must so take the miracles of our Lord and~
Saviour, as believing both that they were actually wrought, and that they have~
some mystic interpretation for our instruction. For in His works, power speaketh~
one thing and mystery again another. Behold here, for instance. We know not~
historically who this blind man was, but we do know of what he was mystically~
the figure. Mankind is blind, driven out from Eden in the persons of his first~
parents, knowing not the light of heaven, and suffering the darkness of~
condemnation. But, nevertheless, through the coming of his Redeemer, he is~
enlightened, so that now he seeth by hope already the gladness of inward light,~
and walketh by good works in the path of life.

[Responsory8]
R. The word of the Lord came unto Abram, saying
* Fear not, Abram I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
V. For I am the Lord thy God That brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees.
R. Fear not, Abram I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.

[Lectio9]
One must note that as Jesus drew to Jericho a blind man received his sight. Now,~
this name Jericho, being interpreted, signifieth the city of the moon and in~
Holy Scripture the moon is used as a figure of our imperfect flesh, of whose~
gradual corruption her monthly waning is a type. As, therefore, our Maker~
draweth nigh to Jericho, a blind man receiveth his sight. While the Godhead~
taketh. into itself our weak manhood, man receiveth again the light which he had~
lost. By God's suffering in the Manhood, man is raised up toward God. This blind~
man is also well described as sitting by the wayside begging for the Truth saith I~
am the Way.'' (John xiv. 6.)

[Responsory9]
R. As the Lord passed by, a certain blind man sat by the way-side, and cried~
unto Him. And the Lord asked him, saying
* What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? Lord, that I may receive my sight.
V. And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto Him; and when he was~
come near, He asked him, saying
R. What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee?
&Gloria
R. Lord, that I may receive my sight.

[Ant Laudes]
O Lord, according to the multitude of thy tender mercies, * blot out my transgressions.
Thou art my God, * and I will praise thee Thou art my God, and I will exalt thee.
O God, early will I seek thee, * to see thy power.
Sing praises, * and exalt Him above all for ever.
Praise ye the Lord * from the heavens, all His angels.

[Capitulum Laudes]

v. Brothers: If I speak with the tongues of men, and of angels, and have not~
charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.

R.br. Incline my heart into thy testimonies
R. Incline my heart * into thy testimonies
V. Turn away my eyes that they may not behold vanity: quicken me in thy way
R. Into thy testimonies
&Gloria
R. Incline my heart into thy testimonies

[Ant 2]
Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, * and all things that are written by the Prophets~
concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished for He shall be delivered unto~
the Gentiles, and shall be mocked and spitted on; and they shall scourge Him,~
and put Him to death, and the third day He shall rise again.

[Versum 2]
V. Lord, thou hast been our refuge
R. From generation to generation.

[Ant Prima]
As Jesus went on His way, * as He was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind~
man cried unto Him, that he might worthily receive his sight.

[Ant Tertia]
As the Lord passed by, * a certain blind man cried unto Him Thou Son of David,~
have mercy on me.

[Ant Sexta]
And they that went before rebuked him, * that he should hold his peace but he~
cried so much the more Thou Son of David, have mercy on me!

[Capitulum Sexta]
!1 Cor 13:8-9
v. Charity never falleth away: whether prophecies shall be made void, or tongues~
shall cease, or knowledge shall be destroyed.For we know in part, and we~
prophesy in part.
$Deo gratias

[Ant Nona]
The blind man cried on the Lord * so much the more, to give him light.

[Capitulum Nona]
!1 Cor 13:13
v. And now there remain faith, hope, and charity, these three: but the greatest~
of these is charity.
$Deo gratias

[Ant 3]
And Jesus stood, * and commanded the blind man to be brought unto Him, and He~
asked him, saying What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? Lord, that I may~
receive my sight. And Jesus said unto him Receive thy sight thy faith hath saved~
thee. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Him, glorifying God.

[Versum 3]
V. Let my prayer, O Lord, be set forth.
R. As incense before thee.

v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 18:31-43
18:31 Then Jesus took unto him the twelve, and said to them: Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things shall be accomplished which were written by the prophets concerning the Son of man.
18:32 For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and scourged, and spit upon:
18:33 And after they have scourged him, they will put him to death; and the third day he shall rise again.
18:34 And they understood none of these things, and this word was hid from them, and they understood not the things that were said.
18:35 Now it came to pass, when he drew nigh to Jericho, that a certain blind man sat by the way side, begging.
18:36 And when he heard the multitude passing by, he asked what this meant.
18:37 And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.
18:38 And he cried out, saying: Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me.
18:39 And they that went before, rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out much more: Son of David, have mercy on me.
18:40 And Jesus standing, commanded him to be brought unto him. And when he was come near, he asked him,
18:41 Saying: What wilt thou that I do to thee? But he said: Lord, that I may see.
18:42 And Jesus said to him: Receive thy sight: thy faith hath made thee whole.
18:43 And immediately he saw, and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.
