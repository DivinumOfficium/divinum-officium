From the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 7:11-16
At that time Jesus went into a city called Nain and His disciples went with~
Him, and much people. And so on.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop of Hippo.
!44th Discourse on the Words of the Lord.
That her son was called again to life was the joy of that widowed mother; that~
souls of men are every day called to life is the joy of our Mother the Church.~
He was dead in body they have been dead in mind. His death was outward, and~
was outwardly bewailed; their inward. Death hath been neither mourned for nor~
seen. But He hath sought for them, Who hath seen that they are dead, and He only~
hath seen that they are dead, Who hath been able to make them alive. If He had~
not come to raise the dead, the Apostle had not said: "Awake, thou that sleepest,~
and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light." (Eph. v. 14.)

[Lectio8]
We find written how the Lord raised from the dead three persons visibly, but~
thousands invisibly. But how many they may have been whom He raised visibly, who~
knoweth For all the things which He did are not written. John saith thus  "~
There are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be~
written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the~
books that should be written." (xxi. 25.) There were then, doubtless, many more~
raised to life, but it is not meaningless that three are recorded. For our Lord~
Jesus Christ hath willed that those things which He did carnally, we should~
understand also spiritually. He worked not miracles only for the sake of working~
wonders, but that His works might be at once wonderful to them that beheld, and~
true to them that understand them.

[Lectio9]
Even as one that looketh upon a scroll right fairly written, and knoweth not how~
to read therein, praiseth the hand of the old scribe when he seeth the beauty of~
the points, but what it saith, what those points mean, he knoweth not, and~
praiseth by the eye, without understanding by the mind,  and as, on the other~
hand, he that can not only gaze on it, as can all men, but also can read it,~
praiseth the penmanship, and catcheth the sense likewise, which the unlearned~
cannot do even so, there were some that saw the miracles which Christ did, and~
understood not what they meant, nor what they, as it were, hinted to such as did~
understand them, and these only marvelled to see them wrought. And other some~
there were which saw the works, and marvelled, and understood them, and profited~
by them. And it is as these last that we ought to be in the school of Christ.

Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 7:11-16
7:11 And it came to pass afterwards, that he went into a city that is called Naim; and there went with him his disciples, and a great multitude.
7:12 And when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold a dead man was carried out, the only son of his mother; and she was a widow: and a great multitude of the city was with her.
7:13 Whom when the Lord had seen, being moved with mercy towards her, he said to her: Weep not.
7:14 And he came near and touched the bier. And they that carried it, stood still. And he said: Young man, I say to thee, arise.
7:15 And he that was dead, sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.
7:16 And there came a fear on them all: and they glorified God, saying: A great prophet is risen up among us: and, God hath visited his people.
