[Lectio1]
From the Book of Ecclesiastes
!Eccl 3:1-8
1 All things have their season, and in their times all things pass under heaven.
2 A time to be born and a time to die. A time to plant, and a time to pluck up~
that which is planted.
3 A time to kill, and a time to heal. A time to destroy, and a time to build.
4 A time to weep, and a time to laugh. A time to mourn, and a time to dance.
5 A time to scatter stones, and a time to gather. A time to embrace, and a time~
to be far from embraces.
6 A time to get, and a time to lose. A time to keep, and a time to cast away.
7 A time to rend, and a time to sew. A time to keep silence, and a time to~
speak.
8 A time of love, and a time of hatred. A time of war, and a time of peace.

!Eccl 3:9-13
9 What hath man more of his labour?
10 I have seen the trouble, which God hath given the sons of men to be exercised~
in it.
11 He hath made all things good in their time, and hath delivered the world to~
their consideration, so that man cannot find out the work which God hath made~
from the beginning to the end.
12 And I have known that there was no better thing than to rejoice, and to do~
well in this life.
13 For every man that eateth and drinketh, and seeth good of his labour, this is~
the gift of God.

!Eccl 3:14-17
14 I have learned that all the works which God hath made, continue for ever: we~
cannot add any thing, nor take away from those things which God hath made that~
he may be feared.
15 That which hath been made, the same continueth: the things that shall be,~
have already been: and God restoreth that which is past.
16 I saw under the sun in the place of judgment wickedness, and in the place of~
justice iniquity.
17 And I said in my heart: God shall judge both the just and the wicked, and~
then shall be the time of every thing.
