Lesson from the second letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians
!2 Cor 3:1-3
1 Do we begin again to commend ourselves? Or do we need (as some do) epistles of~
commendation to you, or from you?
2 You are our epistle, written in our hearts, which is known and read by all~
men:
3 Being manifested, that you are the epistle of Christ, ministered by us, and~
written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of~
stone, but in the fleshly tables of the heart.

[Responsory1]
R. O how great is thy goodness, O Lord
* Which Thou hast laid up for them that fear thee!
V. Which Thou, O Lord, hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons~
of men!
R. Which Thou hast laid up for them that fear thee!

[Lectio2]
!2 Cor 3:4-8
4 And such confidence we have, through Christ, towards God.
5 Not that we are sufficient to think any thing of ourselves, as of ourselves:~
but our sufficiency is from God.
6 Who also hath made us fit ministers of the new testament, not in the letter,~
but in the spirit. For the letter killeth, but the spirit quickeneth.
7 Now if the ministration of death, engraven with letters upon stones, was~
glorious; so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face~
of Moses, for the glory of his countenance, which is made void:
8 How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather in glory?

[Responsory2]
R. O God, be Thou my helper.
* Neither leave me.
V. Nor forsake me O God of my salvation.
R. Neither leave me.

[Lectio3]
!2 Cor 3:9-14
9 For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more the ministration~
of justice aboundeth in glory.
10 For even that which was glorious in this part was not glorified, by reason of~
the glory that excelleth.
11 For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth~
is in glory.
12 Having therefore such hope, we use much confidence:
13 And not as Moses put a veil upon his face, that the children of Israel might~
not steadfastly look on the face of that which is made void.
14 But their senses were made dull. For, until this present day, the selfsame~
veil, in the reading of the old testament, remaineth not taken away (because in~
Christ it is made void).

[Responsory3]
R. I will bless the Lord at all times.
* His praise shall continually be in my mouth.
V. My soul shall make her boast in the Lord; the humble shall hear thereof and~
be glad.
R. His praise shall continually be in my mouth.
&Gloria
R. His praise shall continually be in my mouth.
