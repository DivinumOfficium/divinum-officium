From the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 11:5-13
At that time Jesus said unto His disciples Which of you shall have a friend,~
and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him Friend, lend me three~
loaves. And so on.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop of Milan.
!Book vii. on Luke xi.
We gather from this commandment, among other things, that we ought to pray, not~
only by day, but also by night. Thou seest how that he which arose at midnight~
to ask three loaves of his friend, and endured in supplication, was not~
disappointed of that which he sought. Of what are these three loaves a figure,~
but of that our Mysterious Bread Which cometh down from heaven Thou seest that~
if thou lovest the Lord thy God, thou mayest win His bounty, not only for~
thyself, but for others likewise. And who can deserve more to be called our~
"Friend" than He Which gave His Own Body for us

[Responsory1]
R. Let now the redeemed of the Lord Alleluia
* Say Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
V. Let them whom He hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy, and gathered them out of the lands. A. Say Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.

[Lectio2]
From this Friend it was that David asked bread at midnight, and received it, as~
he saith "At midnight I rise to give thanks unto thee." (Ps. cxviii. 62.) Even~
thus did he obtain those loaves of spiritual nourishment which he still setteth~
before us for our refreshment. How he asked it, we know from that he saith "~
Every night wash I my bed." (Ps. vi. 7.) He knew that there was no fear of~
waking Him Who sleepeth not. (Ps. cxx. 3.) Therefore let us keep in mind the~
things which are written for our learning, and be instant in prayer both by day~
and by night, to ask pardon of our sins.

[Responsory2]
R. O sing unto the Lord. Alleluia.
* Sing unto Him. Alleluia.
V. Give unto the Lord glory and honour, give unto the Lord the glory due unto His Name.
R. Sing unto Him. Alleluia.

[Lectio3]
If David, who was such a Saint, and whose time was so taken up by the cares of a~
kingdom, praised the Lord seven times a day, (Ps. cxviii. 164,) and was always~
present with godly zeal at the morning and evening sacrifice, what ought we to~
do, (who have so much the more need to pray, as the weakness of our body and~
mind doth so much oftener make us to fall, ) that we, wearied with this~
pilgrimage, and worn out by the gradual waning of our earthly day, and the~
changes of life, that we, I say, may not be | starved of that life - giving~
Bread Which strengtheneth man's heart I The Lord teacheth us to be watchful, '~
all of us, and that, not at midnight only, but alway. "And if He shall j come in~
the second watch, or come inj the third watch, and find them so blessed are~
those servants whom the Lord, when He cometh, shall find: watching." (Luke xii.
37.)

[Responsory3]
R. I will declare thy Name unto my brethren Alleluia.
* In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee Alleluia, Alleluia.
V. I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people, and sing unto thee among the nations.
R. In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee Alleluia, Alleluia.
&Gloria
R. In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee Alleluia, Alleluia.

[Ant 2]
Ask, and ye shall receive * seek, and ye shall find knock, and it shall be~
opened unto you. Alleluia.

[Oratio 2]
Grant, we beseech thee, O Almighty God, that we who in our tribulation are yet~
of good cheer because of thy loving-kindness, may find thee mighty to save from~
all dangers.
$Per Dominum.

[Ant 3]
The Father Himself loveth you, * because ye have loved Me, and have believed in~
Me. Alleluia.

[Oratio 3]
O God, from Whom all good things do come, grant to us thy humble servants that~
by thy holy inspiration we may think those things that be good, and by thy~
merciful guiding may perform the same.
$Per Dominum

v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 11:5-13
11:5 And he said to them: Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight, and shall say to him: Friend, lend me three loaves,
11:6 Because a friend of mine is come off his journey to me, and I have not what to set before him.
11:7 And he from within should answer, and say: Trouble me not, the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.
11:8 Yet if he shall continue knocking, I say to you, although he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend; yet, because of his importunity, he will rise, and give him as many as he needeth.
11:9 And I say to you, Ask, and it shall be given you: seek, and you shall find: knock, and it shall be opened to you.
11:10 For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.
11:11 And which of you, if he ask his father bread, will he give him a stone? or a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?
11:12 Or if he shall ask an egg, will he reach him a scorpion?
11:13 If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father from heaven give the good Spirit to them that ask him?
