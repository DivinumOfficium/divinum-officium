[Lectio1]
From the Book Of Ecclesiaticus
!Sir 13:1-6
1 He that toucheth pitch, shall be defiled with it: and he that hath fellowship~
with the proud, shall put on pride.
2 He shall take a burden upon him that hath fellowship with one more honourable~
than himself. And have no fellowship with one that is richer than thyself.
3 What agreement shall the earthen pot have with the kettle? for if they knock~
one against the other, it shall be broken.
4 The rich man hath done wrong, and yet he will fume: but the poor is wronged~
and must hold his peace.
5 If thou give, he will make use of thee: and if thou have nothing, he will~
forsake thee.
6 If thou have any thing, he will live with thee, and will make thee bare, and~
he will not be sorry for thee.

!Sir 13:9-15
9 Humble thyself to God, and wait for his hands.
10 Beware that thou be not deceived Into folly, and be humbled.
11 Be not lowly in thy wisdom, lest being humbled thou be deceived into folly.
12 If thou be invited by one that is mightier, withdraw thyself: for so he will~
invite thee the more.
13 Be not troublesome to him, lest thou be put back: and keep not far from him,~
lest thou be forgotten.
14 Affect not to speak with him as an equal: and believe not his many words: for~
by much talk he will sift thee, and smiling will examine thee concerning thy~
secrets.
15 His cruel mind will lay up thy words: and he will not spare to do thee hurt,~
and to cast thee into prison.

!Sir 13:16-22
16 Take heed to thyself, and attend diligently to what thou hearest: for thou~
walkest in danger of thy ruin.
17 When thou hearest those things, see as it were in sleep, and thou shalt~
awake.
18 Love God all thy life, and call upon him for thy salvation.
19 Every beast loveth its like: so also every man him that is nearest to~
himself.
20 All flesh shall consort with the like to itself, and every man shall~
associate himself to his like.
21 If the wolf shall at any time have fellowship with the lamb, so the sinner~
with the just.
22 What fellowship hath a holy man with a dog, or what part hath the rich with~
the poor?
