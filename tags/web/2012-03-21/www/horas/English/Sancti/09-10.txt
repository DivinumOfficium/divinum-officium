[Oratio]
O Lord, mercifully hear the supplications, which we offer unto thee on this~
solemn feast day of thy blessed Confessor, Nicolaus, and forasmuch as we put no~
trust in our own righteousness, grant that we may be helpen by his prayers who~
walked with thee

This Nicholas is called Nicholas of Tolentino, because he lived in that town for~
most part of his life. He was born at St Angelo, (a place near Fermo,) in the~
March of Ancona, (about the year 1245.) His parents were godly people, and in~
their desire to have children, vowed and made a pilgrimage to the shrine of St~
Nicholas at Bari, where they were assured of their wish, and therefore gave the~
name of Nicholas to the son whom they received. From his childhood the lad gave~
many good signs, but especially as regarded abstinence. In his seventh year, in~
imitation of his blessed name-sake, he began to fast upon several days in the~
week, which custom he always kept, and was content with only bread and water.

[Lectio5]
After he reached man's estate, he enlisted himself in the army of the clergy,~
and was preferred to a Canonry. One day he chanced to hear a sermon upon~
contempt of the world delivered by a preacher of the Order of Hermits of St~
Austin, and was so moved by it that he forthwith entered that Order. As a Friar~
he was most strictly observant of that way of life. He subdued his body with~
rough clothing, stripes, and an iron chain. He never ate meat, and seldom any~
relish to his meals. And he was a burning and shining light of love, lowliness,~
long-suffering, and all other graces.

[Lectio6]
He persisted in constant and earnest prayer, notwithstanding many troubles from~
the assaults of Satan, who sometimes even flogged him. Every night for six~
months before his death he heard Angels singing with such sweetness, that it was a~
fore-taste of the happiness of heaven, and he would often repeat the words of~
the Apostle I have a desire to depart and to be with Christ (Phil. i. 23.)~
Lastly, he foretold to his brethren the day of his death, which was the 10th day~
of September (1306.) After his death also he was famous for miracles, and when~
due investigation had been made thereof, Pope Eugenius IV. enrolled his name~
among those of the Saints.

Nicholas, called of Tolentino because he lived for a long time in that city, was born in the town of Sant'Angelo in Ancona of devout parents who obtained him from God by prayer and the intercession of St. Nicholas. The boy gave evidence of many virtues, especially of abstinence. He was enrolled in the ranks of the clergy and was made a canon. One day he heard a preacher of the Order of Hermits of St. Augustine preaching on the contempt of the world, and, fired by this sermon, he at once entered the same Order. Here he carried out the rule of the religious life so strictly that by fasting, rough clothing, scourging and chains he conquered his body and was outstanding in all other virtues. He never slackened in his constant zeal for prayer, even though he was tormented in various ways by the wiles of the devil, who sometimes even dealt him blows. Each night for six months before his death, he heard angelic melodies ; and at length, having foretold the day of his death, he fell asleep in the Lord. He was famous for miracles both before and after his death, and was enrolled among the Saints by Eugene IV.
