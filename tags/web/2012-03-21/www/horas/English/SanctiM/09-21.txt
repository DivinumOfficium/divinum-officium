Help us, O Lord, by the prayers of thine holy Apostle and Evangelist Matthew,~
that what for ourselves we are not able to obtain, may be freely given us at his~
petition.

[Lectio4]
It came to pass one day at Capernaum, that Christ went forth, and saw a publican,~
named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom; and He said unto him Follow Me.~
And he left all, rose up, and followed Him. And Levi made Him a great feast in~
his own house. This Levi is the Apostle and Evangelist Matthew. After that~
Christ was risen again from the dead, and while he was yet in Judea, before he~
set forth for that land which had fallen to the lot of his preaching, he wrote~
the Gospel of Jesus Christ in the Hebrew tongue, for the sake of them of the~
circumcision who had believed. His was the first written of the four Gospels.~
Thereafter he went to Ethiopia, and there preached the Gospel, confirming his~
preaching with many miracles.

[Lectio5]
Of his miracles, the most notable was that he raised the King's daughter from~
the dead, and thereby brought to believe in Christ the King her father, his wife,~
and all that region. After that the King was dead, Hirtacus, who came after him,~
was fain to take his daughter Iphigenia to wife, but by the exhortation of~
Matthew she had made vow of her maidenhood to God, and stood firm to that holy~
resolution, for which cause Hirtacus commanded to slay the Apostle at the Altar~
while he was performing the mystery. He crowned the dignity of the Apostleship~
with the glory of martyrdom upon the 21 st day of September. His body had been_
brought to Salerno, where it was afterwards buried in a Church dedicated in his~
name during the Popedom of Gregory VII., and there it is held in great worship~
and sought to by great gatherings of people.

From the Exposition of the Book of the Prophet Ezekiel by Pope St Gregory (the~
Great.)
!Hom. 3, Bk. i.
The Prophet writeth very minutely touching the four holy living creatures, whom~
he saw in the spirit as being to come. He saith Every one had four faces, and~
every one had four wings. What signifieth the face save likeness whereby we are~
known? or wings, save the power to fly? since it is by the face that man is~
known from man, and by their wings that the birds' bodies are carried up into~
the air. So the face pertaineth to certitude, and the wings to contemplation.~
With certitude we are known of God Almighty, Who saith I am the Good Shepherd,~
and know My sheep, and am known of Mine. (John x. 14.) And again I know whom I~
have chosen. (xiii. 18.) And by contemplation, whereby we rise above ourselves,~
we as it were fly heavenwards.

From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 9:1-13
At that time Jesus saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom;~
and He saith unto him Follow Me. And so on.
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Bk. i. Comment, on Matth. ix.
The other Evangelists, out of tenderness towards the reputation and honour of~
Matthew, have abstained from speaking of him as a publican by his ordinary name,~
and have called him Levi. Both names were his. But Matthew himself according to~
that Solomon hath The just man is the first to accuse himself, (Prov.~
xviii. 17), and again, in another place Declare thou thy sins that thou~
mayest be justified, doth plainly call himself Matthew the publican, to show~
unto his readers that none need be hopeless of salvation if he will but strive~
to do better, since he himself had been all of a sudden changed from a publican~
into an Apostle.

[Lectio8]
Porphyry and the Emperor Julian (the Apostate) will have it that the account of~
this call of Matthew is either a stupid blunder on the part of a lying writer,~
or else that it showeth what fools they were who followed the Saviour, to go~
senselessly after any one who called them. But there can be no doubt that before~
the Apostles believed they had considered the great signs and works of power~
which had gone before. Moreover, the glory and majesty of the hidden God, which~
shone somewhat through the Face of the Man Christ Jesus, were enough to draw~
them which gazed thereon, even at first sight. For if there be in a stone a~
magnetic power which can make rings and straws and rods come and cleave~
thereunto, how much more must not the Lord of all creatures have been able to~
draw unto Himself them whom He called?

[Lectio9]
And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans~
and sinners came and sat down with Him. They saw how that a publican who had~
turned to better things had found a place of repentance, and therefore they also~
hoped for salvation. It was not, as the Scribes and Pharisees complained,~
sinners clinging to their sinfulness who came to Jesus, but sinners repenting,~
as indeed appeareth from the next words of the Lord, where He saith I will~
have mercy and not sacrifice; for I am not come to call the righteous, but~
sinners to repentance. The Lord went to eat with sinners to the end that He~
might have occasion to teach, and to break spiritual bread unto them which bade~
Him.

v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 9:1-13
9:1 AND entering into a boat, he passed over the water and came into his own city.
9:2 And behold they brought to him one sick of the palsy lying in a bed. And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the man sick of the palsy: Be of good heart, son, thy sins are forgiven thee.
9:3 And behold some of the scribes said within themselves: He blasphemeth.
9:4 And Jesus seeing their thoughts, said: Why do you think evil in your hearts?
9:5 Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee: or to say, Arise, and walk?
9:6 But that you may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then said he to the man sick of palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go into thy house.
9:7 And he arose, and went into his house.
9:8 And the multitude seeing it, feared, and glorified God that gave such power to men.
9:9 And when Jesus passed on from hence, he saw a man sitting in the custom house, named Matthew; and he saith to him: Follow me. And he rose up and followed him.
9:10 And it came to pass as he was sitting at meat in the house, behold many publicans and sinners came, and sat down with Jesus and his disciples.
9:11 And the Pharisees seeing it, said to his disciples: Why doth your master eat with publicans and sinners?
9:12 But Jesus hearing it, said: They that are in health need not a physician, but they that are ill.
9:13 Go then and learn what this meaneth, I will have mercy and not sacrifice. For I am not come to call the just, but sinners.
