22:1 The Lord ruleth me: and I shall want nothing. * He hath set me in a place of pasture.
22:2 He hath brought me up, on the water of refreshment: * he hath converted my soul.
22:3 He hath led me on the paths of justice, * for his own name’s sake.
22:4 For though I should walk in the midst of the shadow of death, I will fear no evils, * for thou art with me.
22:5 Thy rod and thy staff, * they have comforted me.
22:6 Thou hast prepared a table before me * against them that afflict me.
22:7 Thou hast anointed my head with oil; * and my chalice which inebriateth me, how goodly is it!
22:8 And thy mercy will follow me * all the days of my life.
22:9 And that I may dwell in the house of the Lord * unto length of days.
