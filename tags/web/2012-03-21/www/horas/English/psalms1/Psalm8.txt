8:1 O Lord our Lord, * how admirable is thy name in the whole earth!
8:2 For thy magnificence is elevated * above the heavens.
8:3 Out of the mouth of infants and of sucklings thou hast perfected praise, because of thy enemies, * that thou mayst destroy the enemy and the avenger.
8:4 For I will behold thy heavens, the works of thy fingers: * the moon and the stars which thou hast founded.
8:5 What is man that thou art mindful of him? * or the son of man that thou visitest him?
8:6 Thou hast made him a little less than the angels, thou hast crowned him with glory and honour: * and hast set him over the works of thy hands.
8:7 Thou hast subjected all things under his feet, * all sheep and oxen: moreover the beasts also of the fields.
8:8 The birds of the air, and the fishes of the sea, * that pass through the paths of the sea.
8:9 O Lord our Lord, * how admirable is thy name in all the earth!
