(Canticum Isaiae * Isa 40:10-17)
40:10 Behold the Lord God shall come with strength, and his arm shall rule: Behold his reward is with him and his work is before him.
40:11 He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather together the lambs with his arm, and shall take them up in his bosom, and he himself shall carry them that are with young.
40:12 Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and weighed the heavens with his palm? who hath poised with three fingers the bulk of the earth, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?
40:13 Who hath forwarded the spirit of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor, and hath taught him?
40:14 With whom hath he consulted, and who hath instructed him, and taught him the path of justice, and taught him knowledge, and shewed him the way of understanding?
40:15 Behold the Gentiles are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the smallest grain of a balance: behold the islands are as a little dust.
40:16 And Libanus shall not be enough to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering.
40:17 All nations are before him as if they had no being at all, and are counted to him as nothing, and vanity.
