(Canticle of_Tobias * Tob. 13:1-11)
13:1 Thou art great, O Lord, for ever, * and thy kingdom is unto all ages:
13:2 For thou scourgest, and thou savest: thou leadest down to hell, and bringest up again: * and there is none that can escape thy hand.
13:3 Give glory to the Lord, ye children of Israel, * and praise him in the sight of the Gentiles:
13:4 Because he hath therefore scattered you among the Gentiles, who know not him, * that you may declare his wonderful works,
13:5 And make them know * that there is no other almighty God besides him.
13:6 He hath chastised us for our iniquities: * and he will save us for his own mercy.
13:7 See then what he hath done with us, and with fear and trembling give ye glory to him: * and extol the eternal King of worlds in your works.
13:8 As for me, I will praise him in the land of my captivity: * because he hath shewn his majesty toward a sinful nation.
13:9 Be converted therefore, ye sinners, and do justice before God, * believing that he will shew his mercy to you.
13:10 And I and my soul * will rejoice in him.
13:11 Bless ye the Lord, all his elect, * keep days of joy, and give glory to him.
