46:1 O clap your hands, all ye nations: * shout unto God with the voice of joy,
46:2 For the Lord is high, terrible: * a great king over all the earth.
46:3 He hath subdued the people under us; * and the nations under our feet. 
46:4 He hath chosen for us his inheritance, * the beauty of Jacob which he hath loved.
46:5 God is ascended with jubilee, * and the Lord with the sound of trumpet. 
46:6 Sing praises to our God, sing ye: * sing praises to our king, sing ye.
46:7 For God is the king of all the earth: * sing ye wisely.
46:8 God shall reign over the nations: * God sitteth on his holy throne.
46:9 The princes of the people are gathered together, with the God of Abraham: * for the strong gods of the earth are exceedingly exalted.
