86:1 The foundations thereof are in the holy mountains: * The Lord loveth the gates of Sion above all the tabernacles of Jacob.
86:2 Glorious things are said of thee, * O city of God.
86:3 I will be mindful of Rahab and of Babylon * knowing me.
86:4 Behold the foreigners, and Tyre, and the people of the Ethiopians, * these were there.
86:5 Shall not Sion say: This man and that man is born in her? * and the Highest himself hath founded her.
86:6 The Lord shall tell in his writings of peoples and of princes, * of them that have been in her.
86:7 The dwelling in thee * is as it were of all rejoicing.
