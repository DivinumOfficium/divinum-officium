50:1 Have mercy on me, O God, * according to thy great mercy.
50:2 And according to the multitude of thy tender mercies * blot out my iniquity.
50:3 Wash me yet more from my iniquity, * and cleanse me from my sin.
50:4 For I know my iniquity, * and my sin is always before me.
50:5 To thee only have I sinned, and have done evil before thee: * that thou mayst be justified in thy words, and mayst overcome when thou art judged.
50:6 For behold I was conceived in iniquities; * and in sins did my mother conceive me.
50:7 For behold thou hast loved truth: * the uncertain and hidden things of thy wisdom thou hast made manifest to me.
50:8 Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed: * thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow.
50:9 To my hearing thou shalt give joy and gladness: * and the bones that have been humbled shall rejoice.
50:10 Turn away thy face from my sins, * and blot out all my iniquities.
50:11 Create a clean heart in me, O God: * and renew a right spirit within my bowels.
50:12 Cast me not away from thy face; * and take not thy holy spirit from me.
50:13 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, * and strengthen me with a perfect spirit.
50:14 I will teach the unjust thy ways: * and the wicked shall be converted to thee.
50:15 Deliver me from blood, O God, thou God of my salvation: * and my tongue shall extol thy justice.
50:16 O Lord, thou wilt open my lips: * and my mouth shall declare thy praise.
50:17 For if thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would indeed have given it: * with burnt offerings thou wilt not be delighted.
50:18 A sacrifice to God is an afflicted spirit: * a contrite and humbled heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
50:19 Deal favourably, O Lord, in thy good will with Sion; * that the walls of Jerusalem may be built up.
50:20 Then shalt thou accept the sacrifice of justice, oblations and whole burnt offerings: * then shall they lay calves upon thy altar.
