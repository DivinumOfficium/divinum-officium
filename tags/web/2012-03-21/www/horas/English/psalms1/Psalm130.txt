130:1 Lord, my heart is not exalted: * nor are my eyes lofty.
130:2 Neither have I walked in great matters, * nor in wonderful things above me.
130:3 If I was not humbly minded, * but exalted my soul:
130:4 As a child that is weaned is towards his mother, * so reward in my soul.
130:5 Let Israel hope in the Lord, * from henceforth now and for ever.
