(Canticle of_Judith * Judith 16:15-22)
16:15 Let us sing a hymn to the Lord, * let us sing a new hymn to our God.
16:16 O Adonai, Lord, great art thou, and glorious in thy power, * and no one can overcome thee.
16:17 Let all thy creatures serve thee: * because thou hast spoken, and they were made:
16:18 Thou didst send forth thy spirit, and they were created, * and there is no one that can resist thy voice.
16:19 The mountains shall be moved from the foundations with the waters: * the rocks shall melt as wax before thy face.
16:20 But they that fear thee, * shall be great with thee in all things.
16:21 Woe be to the nation that riseth up against my people: for the Lord almighty will take revenge on them, * in the day of judgment he will visit them.
16:22 For he will give fire, and worms into their flesh, * that they may burn, and may feel for ever.
