92:1 The Lord hath reigned, he is clothed with beauty: * the Lord is clothed with strength, and hath girded himself.
92:2 For he hath established the world * which shall not be moved.
92:3 Thy throne is prepared from of old: * thou art from everlasting.
92:4 The floods have lifted up, O Lord: * the floods have lifted up their voice.
92:5 The floods have lifted up their waves, * with the noise of many waters.
92:6 Wonderful are the surges of the sea: * wonderful is the Lord on high.
92:7 Thy testimonies are become exceedingly credible: * holiness becometh thy house, O Lord, unto length of days.
