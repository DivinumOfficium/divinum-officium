98:1 (A psalm for David himself.) The Lord hath reigned, let the people be angry: he that sitteth on the cherubims: let the earth be moved.
98:2 The lord is great in Sion, and high above all people.
98:3 Let them give praise to thy great name: for it is terrible and holy:
98:4 And the king's honour loveth judgment. Thou hast prepared directions: thou hast done judgment and justice in Jacob.
98:5 Exalt ye the Lord our God, and adore his footstool, for it is holy.
98:6 Moses and Aaron among his priests: and Samuel among them that call upon his name. They called upon the Lord, and he heard them:
98:7 He spoke to them in the pillar of the cloud. They kept his testimonies, and the commandment which he gave them.
98:8 Thou didst hear them, O Lord our God: thou wast a merciful God to them, and taking vengeance on all their inventions.
98:9 Exalt ye the Lord our God, and adore at his holy mountain: for the Lord our God is holy.
