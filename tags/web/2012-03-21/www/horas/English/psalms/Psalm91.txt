91:1 (A psalm of a canticle on the sabbath day.)
91:2 It is good to give praise to the Lord: and to sing to thy name, O most High.
91:3 To shew forth thy mercy in the morning, and thy truth in the night:
91:4 Upon an instrument of ten strings, upon the psaltery: with a canticle upon the harp.
91:5 For thou hast given me, O Lord, a delight in thy doings: and in the works of thy hands I shall rejoice.
91:6 O Lord, how great are thy works! thy thoughts are exceeding deep.
91:7 The senseless man shall not know: nor will the fool understand these things.
91:8 When the wicked shall spring up as grass: and all the workers of iniquity shall appear: That they may perish for ever and ever:
91:9 But thou, O Lord, art most high for evermore.
91:10 For behold thy enemies, O lord, for behold thy enemies shall perish: and all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
91:11 But my horn shall be exalted like that of the unicorn: and my old age in plentiful mercy.
91:12 My eye also hath looked down upon my enemies: and my ear shall hear of the downfall of the malignant that rise up against me.
91:13 The just shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow up like the cedar of Libanus.
91:14 They that are planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of the house of our God.
91:15 They shall still increase in a fruitful old age: and shall be well treated,
91:16 That they may shew, That the Lord our God is righteous, and there is no iniquity in him.
