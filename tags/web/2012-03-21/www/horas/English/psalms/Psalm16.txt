16:1 (The prayer of David.) Hear, O Lord, my justice: attend to my supplication. Give ear unto my prayer, which proceedeth not from deceitful lips.
16:2 Let my judgment come forth from thy countenance: let thy eyes behold the things that are equitable.
16:3 Thou hast proved my heart, and visited it by night, thou hast tried me by fire: and iniquity hath not been found in me.
16:4 That my mouth may not speak the works of men: for the sake of the words of thy lips, I have kept hard ways.
16:5 Perfect thou my goings in thy paths: that my footsteps be not moved.
16:6 I have cried to thee, for thou, O God, hast heard me: O incline thy ear unto me, and hear my words.
16:7 Shew forth thy wonderful mercies; thou who savest them that trust in thee.
16:8 From them that resist thy right hand keep me, as the apple of thy eye. Protect me under the shadow of thy wings.
16:9 From the face of the wicked who have afflicted me. My enemies have surrounded my soul:
16:10 They have shut up their fat: their mouth hath spoken proudly.
16:11 They have cast me forth, and now they have surrounded me: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth.
16:12 They have taken me, as a lion prepared for the prey; and as a young lion dwelling in secret places.
16:13 Arise, O Lord, disappoint him and supplant him; deliver my soul from the wicked one; thy sword
16:14 From the enemies of thy hand. O Lord, divide them from the few of the earth in their life: their belly is filled from thy hidden stores. They are full of children: and they have left to their little ones the rest of their substance.
16:15 But as for me, I will appear before thy sight in justice: I shall be satisfied when thy glory shall appear.
