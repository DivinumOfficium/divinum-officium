(Canticum Tobiae Tob 13:1-10)
1 Thou art great, O Lord, for ever, and thy kingdom is unto all ages: 
2 For thou scourgest, and thou savest: thou leadest down to hell, and bringest up again: and there is none that can escape thy hand. 
3 Give glory to the Lord, ye children of Israel, and praise him in the sight of the Gentiles: 
4 Because he hath therefore scattered you among the Gentiles, who know not him, that you may declare his wonderful works, and make them know that there is no other almighty God besides him. 
5 He hath chastised us for our iniquities: and he will save us for his own mercy.
6 See then what he hath done with us, and with fear and trembling give ye glory to him: and extol the eternal King of worlds in your works. 
7 As for me, I will praise him in the land of my captivity: because he hath shown his majesty toward a sinful nation. 
8 Be converted therefore, ye sinners, and do justice before God, believing that he will show his mercy to you. 
9 And I and my soul will rejoice in him. 
10 Bless ye the Lord, all his elect, keep days of joy, and give glory to him.
