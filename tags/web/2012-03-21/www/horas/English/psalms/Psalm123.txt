123:1 (A gradual canticle.) If it had not been that the Lord was with us, let Israel now say:
123:2 If it had not been that the Lord was with us, When men rose up against us,
123:3 Perhaps they had swallowed us up alive. When their fury was enkindled against us,
123:4 Perhaps the waters had swallowed us up.
123:5 Our soul hath passed through a torrent: perhaps our soul had passed through a water insupportable.
123:6 Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us to be a prey to their teeth.
123:7 Our soul hath been delivered as a sparrow out of the snare of the fowlers. The snare is broken, and we are delivered.
123:8 Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
