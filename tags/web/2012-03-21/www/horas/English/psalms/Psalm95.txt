95:1 (A canticle for David himself, when the house was built after the captivity.) Sing ye to the Lord a new canticle: sing to the Lord, all the earth.
95:2 Sing ye to the Lord and bless his name: shew forth his salvation from day to day.
95:3 Declare his glory among the Gentiles: his wonders among all people.
95:4 For the Lord is great, and exceedingly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods.
95:5 For all the gods of the Gentiles are devils: but the Lord made the heavens.
95:6 Praise and beauty are before him: holiness and majesty in his sanctuary.
95:7 Bring ye to the Lord, O ye kindreds of the Gentiles, bring ye to the Lord glory and honour:
95:8 Bring to the Lord glory unto his name. Bring up sacrifices, and come into his courts:
95:9 Adore ye the Lord in his holy court. Let all the earth be moved at his presence.
95:10 Say ye among the Gentiles, the Lord hath reigned. For he hath corrected the world, which shall not be moved: he will judge the people with justice.
95:11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad, let the sea be moved, and the fulness thereof:
95:12 The fields and all things that are in them shall be joyful. Then shall all the trees of the woods rejoice
95:13 before the face of the Lord, because he cometh: because he cometh to judge the earth. He shall judge the world with justice, and the people with his truth.
