103:1 (For David himself.) Bless the Lord, O my soul: O Lord my God, thou art exceedingly great. Thou hast put on praise and beauty:
103:2 And art clothed with light as with a garment. Who stretchest out the heaven like a pavilion:
103:3 Who coverest the higher rooms thereof with water. Who makest the clouds thy chariot: who walkest upon the wings of the winds.
103:4 Who makest thy angels spirits: and thy ministers a burning fire.
103:5 Who hast founded the earth upon its own bases: it shall not be moved for ever and ever.
103:6 The deep like a garment is its clothing: above the mountains shall the waters stand.
103:7 At thy rebuke they shall flee: at the voice of thy thunder they shall fear.
103:8 The mountains ascend, and the plains descend into the place which thou hast founded for them.
103:9 Thou hast set a bound which they shall not pass over; neither shall they return to cover the earth.
103:10 Thou sendest forth springs in the vales: between the midst of the hills the waters shall pass.
103:11 All the beasts of the field shall drink: the wild asses shall expect in their thirst.
103:12 Over them the birds of the air shall dwell: from the midst of the rocks they shall give forth their voices.
103:13 Thou waterest the hills from thy upper rooms: the earth shall be filled with the fruit of thy works:
103:14 Bringing forth grass for cattle, and herb for the service of men. That thou mayst bring bread out of the earth:
103:15 And that wine may cheer the heart of man. That he may make the face cheerful with oil: and that bread may strengthen man's heart.
103:16 The trees of the field shall be filled, and the cedars of Libanus which he hath planted:
103:17 There the sparrows shall make their nests. The highest of them is the house of the heron.
103:18 The high hills are a refuge for the harts, the rock for the irchins.
103:19 He hath made the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.
103:20 Thou hast appointed darkness, and it is night: in it shall all the beasts of the woods go about:
103:21 The young lions roaring after their prey, and seeking their meat from God.
103:22 The sun ariseth, and they are gathered together: and they shall lie down in their dens.
103:23 Man shall go forth to his work, and to his labour until the evening.
103:24 How great are thy works, O Lord thou hast made all things in wisdom: the earth is filled with thy riches.
103:25 So is this great sea, which stretcheth wide its arms: there are creeping things without number: Creatures little and great.
103:26 There the ships shall go. This sea dragon which thou hast formed to play therein.
103:27 All expect of thee that thou give them food in season.
103:28 What thou givest to them they shall gather up: when thou openest thy hand, they shall all be filled with good.
103:29 But if thou turnest away thy face, they shall be troubled: thou shalt take away their breath, and they shall fail, and shall return to their dust.
103:30 Thou shalt send forth thy spirit, and they shall be created: and thou shalt renew the face of the earth.
103:31 May the glory of the Lord endure for ever: the Lord shall rejoice in his works.
103:32 He looketh upon the earth, and maketh it tremble: he troubleth the mountains, and they smoke.
103:33 I will sing to the Lord as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.
103:34 Let my speech be acceptable to him: but I will take delight in the Lord.
103:35 Let sinners be consumed out of the earth, and the unjust, so that they be no more: O my soul, bless thou the Lord.
