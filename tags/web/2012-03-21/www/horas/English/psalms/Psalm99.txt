99:1 (A psalm of praise.)
99:2 Sing joyfully to God, all the earth: serve ye the Lord with gladness. Come in before his presence with exceeding great joy.
99:3 Know ye that the Lord he is God: he made us, and not we ourselves. We are his people and the sheep of his pasture.
99:4 Go ye into his gates with praise, into his courts with hymns: and give glory to him. Praise ye his name:
99:5 For the Lord is sweet, his mercy endureth for ever, and his truth to generation and generation.
