!Commemoratio Ss. Mart. Quatuor Coronatorum.
@Commune/C3:Oratio proper
!Könyörgés.
Grant, we beseech thee, O Almighty God, that we who know thy glorious witnesses~
to have been in their testifying leal toward thee, may feel, now that they are~
with thee, that they are in their prayers pitiful towards us.

[Lectio4]
From the Book upon Death, written by the holy Martyr Cyprian, Bishop (of~
Carthage.)
!At end
Dearly beloved brethren, we should keep well in our mind and thoughts that we~
are living here meanwhile as strangers and pilgrims. Let us hail that day which~
will see us each at home in one of the many mansions, which will see us~
delivered hence, and disentangled from the nets and snares of things temporal,~
and put us back into the Garden of Eden, and into the kingdom of heaven. Is~
there any in a far country but is quick to make his way to his Fatherland? Was~
ever any in haste to make his voyage homeward, but longed for a fair wind, that~
he might the sooner embrace his loved ones?

[Lectio5]
We reckon Paradise to be our home; already we begin to have the Patriarchs for~
our kinsmen. Why should we not make haste and run, to see our home, and to greet~
our kinsfolk? There are a great many of those we love waiting for us there~
father, and mother, and brothers, and children, there in great company they~
await us, they who are sure now never to die any more, but not yet sure of us. O,~
when we come to see them and to embrace them, what gladness will it be both for~
us and for them! O, what will be the brightness of life in that heavenly kingdom~
where there is no more fear of death, but the certainty of living everlastingly! O,~
what consummated, O, what enduring happiness?

[Lectio6]
There is the glorious company of the Apostles, there is the jubilant fellowship~
of the Prophets, there is the countless army of Martyrs crowned for victory in~
strife and in suffering. There triumph the virgins who by noble self-control~
have tamed the desires of the flesh and of the body. There are repaid with mercy~
the merciful, who by feeding and gifting the needy, have wrought righteousness,~
have kept the commandments of the Lord, and have exchanged heritages upon earth~
for treasures in heaven. Thitherward, dearly beloved brethren, let us eagerly~
run, with such as these soon to be, unto Christ soon to come, let us be fain.

Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kõnyvébõl
!Matt 5:1-12
 A tömeg láttára fölment a hegyre és leült. Tanítványai köréje gyûltek És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!Bk. i. on the Lord's Sermon.
Blessed are ye, saith the Lord, when men shall revile you, and persecute you,~
and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for My sake. Rejoice, and~
be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven. If any be seeking under~
the name of a Christian the pleasures of this world and the possession of~
temporal goods, let him bethink him that our blessedness is inward, even as the~
mouth of the Prophet saith concerning the soul of the Church The King's~
daughter is all glorious within. (Ps. xliv. 15.) Without, she is reviled, and~
persecution and evil report are her promised portion. And yet for these very~
things, great is her reward in heaven, as indeed is felt in the hearts of the~
sufferers, at least of such as are able already to say But we glory in~
tribulations also; knowing that tribulation worketh patience; and patience,~
experience; and experience, hope; and hope maketh not ashamed; because the love~
of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, Which is given unto us.~
~(Rom. v. 3-5.)

[Lectio8]
To suffer such things is not in itself fruitful; what is fruitful, is to bear~
them for Christ's Name's sake not calmly only but gladly. There are a great many~
heretics who mislead souls under the name of Christians, and they suffer such~
things plentifully, but they are cut out from the reward, for it is not said~
only Blessed are they which are persecuted, but Blessed are they which are~
persecuted for righteousness' sake. Where there is not sound faith there cannot~
be righteousness, for the just shall live by faith. (Heb. x. 38.) Neither let~
schismatics promise themselves any of that reward, for as righteousness cannot~
exist where there is no faith, so neither can it exist where there is no love.~
And schismatics have no love, for love worketh no ill to his neighbour, (Rom.~
xiii. 10,) and if they had it, they would not tear the Body of Christ, which is~
the Church.

[Lectio93]
!Commemoration martyrum
In the persecution under Diocletian four brothers named Severus, Severian,~
Carpophorus, and Victorinus, boldly refused to worship the gods, and were lashed~
with whips loaded with lead until they gave up their lives for Christ's Name's~
sake under the strokes. Their bodies were thrown out to be eaten by the dogs,~
but as they remained untouched after a long while, the Christians took them away,~
and buried them in a sand-pit upon the Lavican Way at the third milestone from~
the City, hard by the grave of the holy martyrs Claudius, Nicostratus,~
Symphorian, Castorius, and Simplicius, who had suffered under the same Emperor,~
because being excellent sculptors they could nowise be brought to make figures~
of idols, and when they were brought to the image of the Sun to do reverence to~
it, they had said they would never worship the works of men's hands. For this~
reason they were thrown into prison, and when after many days they were still~
found of the same mind, they were first lashed with scourges armed with hooks,~
and then soldered up alive in leaden coffins and thrown into the river. There is~
in the City of Rome a Church called that of the Four Holy Crowned. Their actual~
names were long unknown, but afterwards made manifest by God. In this Church are~
honourably buried the bodies of these four, and also those of the other five;~
and a Festival is held in their honour upon the 8th day of November.
