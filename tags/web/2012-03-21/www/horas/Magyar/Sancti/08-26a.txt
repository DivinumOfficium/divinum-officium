[Lectio93]
Pope Zephyrinus was a Roman, who was called to govern the Church, (in the year~
202,) during the reign of the Emperor Severus. It was he who decreed that they~
who are to be ordained should be ordained only at a fit time, and in the~
presence of many clerks and laymen, as was indeed already the custom, and that~
none but learned men and well known and spoken of should be set apart to that~
office. He decreed also that when the Bishop celebrated the Holy Liturgy, all~
the Priests should be present around him. Also he decreed that no Patriarch,~
Primate, or Metropolitan should pronounce sentence on a Bishop, unless they were~
charged with the authority of the Apostolic See. He lived as Pope eighteen~
years. He held four December ordinations, wherein he made thirteen Priests,~
seven Deacons, and thirteen Bishops for divers places. He received the crown of~
his testimony under the Emperor Antonine, and was buried on the Appian Way, near~
the cemetery of Callistus, upon the 26th day of August, (in the year 219.)
