O God, who didst teach blessed Gabriel continuously to dwell upon the sorrows of thy most sweet Mother, and through her didst rise him, to the glory of holiness and miracles; grant us through his intercession and example so to share in the sorrows of thy Mother that we made be saved under her maternal protection:

Gabriel, born at Assisi in Umbria of a respectable family, and called Francis in memory of his seraphic fellow-townsman, shewed from boyhood an excellent disposition of soul.  As a youth, when studying letters at Spoleto, he seemed for a time to be allured by the empty beauty and pomp of the world.  But by the gift of the merciful God, who had already called him to the perfection of a Christian life when he had fallen sick, he began to tire of the vanity of the world, and to desire immortal treasures alone.  But to quicken his obedience to the call of God, it happened that as he saw the celebrated Image of the Blessed Virgin being carried with solemn pomp outside the precincts of the church of Spoleto, he experienced the flame of divine love, and at the same time decided to enter the Institute of the Clerks of the Passion of Jesus.  Therefore, after overcoming no slight difficulties, he joyfully donned the somber habit in the secluded place of Morrovalle, and chose to be called Gabriel of Our Lady of Sorrows, to recall forever the memory of her joys and griefs.

[Lectio5]
In the novitiate, day by day he became conspicuous for regular observance and for the exercise of all the virtues, and in a short time he came to be considered a pattern of perfect holiness, not only by his companions and his seniors, but also beyond the confines of the monastery ; he became a sweet odour in Christ in every place.  An assiduous devotee of the Lord's Passion, he spent days and nights meditating upon it.  He was drawn by unbelievable zeal towards the Holy Eucharist, a memorial of that Passion ; and when he nourished himself with it, he burned with seraphic ardour.  There was nothing more noticeable than his filial piety towards the great Mother of God.  He was accustomed to pay her honour for every type of devotion, but especially to contemplate her stricken and afflicted by the sufferings of Jesus, with such sorrow that he shed floods of tears.  The sorrowful Virgin was, as it were, the whole reason of his being, and the teacher of the holiness that he had acquired.  As a result all his associates shared the one opinion that this servant of God had been inspired from on high so that the cult of St. Mary of Sorrows through his example might receive a great increase.

[Lectio6]
Among other virtues, he especially loved Christian humility and obedience ; for he considered himself the least of all.  He therefore strove eagerly to do all the most menial work of the house, and he most diligently performed, not only the direct commands, but even the unexpressed wishes of his superiors.  Curbing his senses, and accustoming himself to a life of austerity, he retained unfaded the flower of his virginity, and completely crucified to the world, he lived to God alone, enjoying an intimate familiarity with his Lord.  And so, at Isola in the Abruzzi, filling the short span of his life with so many noble virtues, consumed by the fire of charity rather than by disease, and refreshed by the aid of the Mother of God, his soul flew to heaven in a most peaceful journey in the year 1862, at the age of twenty-four.  Then, as he had been made illustrious by God through miracles, Pope Pius X added him to the number of the Blessed in heaven.  Likewise, the Supreme Pontiff Benedict XV in 1920, two hundred years after the foundation of the Institute of the Passion, on the feast of the Ascension of the Lord, decreed the honours of the Saints to the blessed youth ; and Pius XI extended his Office and Mass to the Universal Church.

Homilia sancti Bedae Venerabilis Presbyteri
!Commentarium in Marcum 10:13-21
Ait discipulis Iesus: Sinite parvulos venite ad me, et no pruhibueritis eos:~
talium enim est regnum Dei. Significanter dixit: Talium est; non: Istorum; ut~
ostenderet non aetatem regnari, sed mores; et his qui similem haberent~
innocentiam et simplicitatem, praemium repromitti: Apostolo quoque in eandem~
sententiam congruente: Fratres, nolite fieri puri sensibus; sed malitia parvuli~
estote; sensu autem ut perfecti sitis. Amen, dico vobis: quisquis non receperit~
regnum Dei velut parvulus, non intrabit in illud. Sicut puer non perseverat in~
iracundia, non laesus meminit, non videns pulchram mulierem delectatur, non~
aliud cogitat, aliud loquitur; sic et vos nisi talem haueritis innocentiam et~
animi puritatem, regnum caelorum non poteris intrare. Aliter regnum Dei, id est~
doctrinam Evangelii, sicut parvuli accipere jubemur; qui quomodo parvulus in~
discendo non contradicit doctoribus, neque rationes et verba componit adversum~
eos resistens, sed fideliter suscipit quod docetur, et cum metu obtemperat et~
quiescet: ita et nos, in obediendo simpliciter et sine ulla retractione, verbis~
Domini, facere debemus. Et complexans eos, et imponens manus super illos~
benedicebat eos. Complexus benedicit parvulos, ut humiles spiritu sua~
benedictione, gratia et dilectione esse significet.

[Lectio8]
Et, cum egressus esset in viam, procurrens quidam, genu flexo ante eum, rogabat~
eum: Magister bone, quid faciam, ut vitam aeternam percipiam? Audierat, credo~
iste quaesitor vitae aeternae a Domino, tantum eos, qui parvulorum velint esse~
similes, dignos esse introitu regni caelestis: atque ideo curam gerens tractatus~
certioris, poscit sibi non per parabolas, sed aperte quibus operum meritis vitam~
aeternam consequi possit, exponi. Jesus autem dixit ei: Praecepta nosti. Haec~
est puerilis innocentiae castitas, quae nobis imitanda proponitur, si regnum Dei~
volumus intrare. At ille respondens ait illi: Magister, haec omnia observavi a~
juventute mea. Non est putandus homo iste vel voto tentatis (ut quidam putavere)~
Dominum interrogasse, vel de sua esse vita mentitus, cum se legis mandata~
custodisse dicebat: sed, simpliciter ut vixerit esse confessus. Qui si mendaci~
autem simulationis noxa reus tenetur, nequaquam intuitus arcana cordis ejus; eum~
diligere diceretur Jesus.

[Lectio9]
Diligit enim Dominus eos qui mandata legis , quamvis minora custodiunt: sed~
nihilominus quod in lege minus fuerat, iis qui perfecti esse desiderant ,~
ostendit, quia non venit solvere legem aut Prophetas, sed adimplere. Ad quam~
perfecto adimpletionem pertinet , quod his consequentum adjungitur; Vade,~
quecumque habes vende, et da pauperibus, et habetis thesaurum in caelo, et veni~
sequere me. Quidcumque perfectus esse voluerit, debet vendere quae habet; et non~
ex parte vendere, sicut Ananias et Saphira, sed totum vendere; et cum vendiderit,~
dare omni pauperibus, et sic sibi praepare thesaurum in regno caelorum. Nec hoc~
ad perfectionem sufficit, , nisi, post contemptas divitias, Salvatorem sequatur,~
id est relictis malis, faciet bona. Facilius enim saeculum contemnitur quam~
voluntas. Multi divitias reliquentes, Dominum non sequuntur. Sequitur autem~
Dominum, qui imitator eius est, et per vestigia illius graditur. Qui enim dicit~
se in Christo credere, debet quomodo ille ambulavit , et ipse ambulare.

Gabriel, born at Assisi in Umbria and called Francis in memory of his seraphic~
fellow-citizen gave evidence of great intellectual gifts. As a young man, when~
by the gift of God's mercy he had already been called to a more perfect life he~
fell ill and began to weary of the vanity of the world. Entering the Passionist~
congregation, he chose the name Gabriel of the Sorrowful Virgin, in order to~
keel in mind continually both the joy and the sorrows of the Virgin Mary.~
Honoring her in every way he was accustomed particularly to contemplating her as~
worn out and afflicted by Jesus' sufferings with such sorrow that he shed flood~
of tears. He kept his virginity intact and, following the strict usage of his~
congregation, he lived wholly crucified to the world, to God alone. Thus he~
complete, his short life in the exercise o all virtues; consumed by the fire of~
charity rather than by the force of his illness and refreshed by the aid of~
God's Mother, he went to heaven in the year 1862. Pope Pius X numbered him among,~
the blessed, Benedict XV among the saintsand Pius XI entered his office and Mass~
to the universal Church.
