[Oratio]
Lighten over us, O Lord, we beseech thee, this solemn Birthday-keeping for thine~
own holy martyrs, Basilides, Cyrinus, Nabor, and Nazarius, and grant that the~
same love of thee which hath brought them for ever and ever, such things as~
exceed all that we can either ask or think, may grow up in us also by the fruits~
of our earnest petition.
$Per Dominum.

at prayer there, a brilliant light broke forth before the eyes of all that were~
there, and shone in all the prison. Marcellinus the keeper of the prison and~
many others were moved by this heavenly glory to believe in the Lord~
ChristBasilides, Cyrinus, Nabor, and Nazarius were afterwards discharged out of~
the prison. However, in the reign of the Emperor Maximian, when they set light~
by his commands also, and had ever in their mouth that there is but one Christ,~
one God, and one Lord, they were tormented with whips loaded with metal, and~
again cast into chains. Thence, on the seventh day, they were brought out, and~
set before the Emperor, and there still persisted in mocking at the foolish~
idols, and declaring that Jesus Christ is God. They were accordingly condemned~
to death and beheaded. Their bodies were given to wild beasts to eat, but, as~
the creatures would not touch them,
