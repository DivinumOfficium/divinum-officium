Olvasmány a Királyok elsõ könyvébõl
!1 Kgs 1:1-4
1 Dávid király éltes öreg lett; hiába burkolták takaróba, nem tudott~
fölmelegedni.
2 Szolgái ezért így szóltak hozzá: Kell keresni urunknak és királyunknak egy~
fiatal leányt, aki szolgálatába áll a királynak, és gondját viseli. Ha kebleden~
pihen, urunk és királyunk fölmelegszik.
3 Izrael egész földjén keresték hát a szép lányt. Így bukkantak rá a sunemi~
Abiságra, s el is vitték a királyhoz.
4 A lány igen-igen szép volt, gondját viselte a királynak és szolgálta, a király~
azonban nem hált vele.

[Responsory1]
R. Prepare your hearts unto the Lord, and serve Him Only
* And He will deliver you out of the hand of your enemies.
V. Return unto Him with all your hearts, and put away the strange gods from~
among you.
R. And He will deliver you out of the hand of your enemies.

[Lectio2]
!1 Kgs 1:5-8
5 Adonija, Haggit fia közben ilyen gondolatokra ragadtatta magát: Én leszek a~
király! Szerzett hát magának szekereket, lovakat és ötven embert, fullajtárnak.
6 Az apja sose tette neki szóvá: Miért viselkedsz így? Ráadásul nagyon szép~
alakja volt, s anyja Absalom után szülte.
7 Beszélt Joábbal, Ceruja fiával és Ebjatár pappal, úgyhogy azok Adonija mellé~
is álltak.
8 Ugyanakkor Cádok pap, Jojada fia, Benaja és Nátán próféta, valamint Simi és~
társai, Dávid vitézei nem tartottak Adonijával.

[Responsory2]
R. God, Which heareth all, even He sent His Angel, and took me from keeping my~
father's sheep, and
* Anointed me with the oil of His mercy.
V. The Lord That delivered me out of the mouth of the lion, and out of the paw~
of the bear
R. And anointed me with the oil of His mercy.

[Lectio3]
!1 Kgs 1:11-15
11 Erre Nátán így szólt Batsebához, Salamon anyjához: "Bizonyára hallottad, hogy~
Adonija, Haggit fia király lett anélkül, hogy urunk, Dávid tudna róla.
12 Nos, hadd adjak neked tanácsot, hogyan mentheted meg az életedet és fiad,~
Salamon életét.
13 Fogd magad, menj be a királyhoz, s mondd neki: Uram és királyom, megesküdtél~
rá szolgálódnak: Fiad, Salamon lesz utánam a király, õ fog trónomra ülni. Miért~
lett hát mégis Adonija a király?
14 Mialatt még beszélsz a királlyal, magam is bemegyek és megerõsítem~
szavaidat."
15 Batseba tehát bement a királyhoz a szobába. A király már nagyon öreg volt, s a~
sunemi Abiság viselte gondját.

[Responsory3]
R. The Lord That delivered me out of the mouth of the lion, and out of the paw~
of the bear
* He will deliver me out of the hand of mine enemies.
V. God hath sent forth His mercy and His truth, and delivered my soul from among~
the lion's whelps.
R. He will deliver me out of the hand of mine enemies.
&Gloria
R. He will deliver me out of the hand of mine enemies.

From the Epistle written to Nepotian by St Jerome, Priest at Bethlehem.
!Ep. ii. torn. i.
Then David, who had once been a man of war, was seventy years old, the chill of~
old age came upon him, and he could get no heat. So they sought out for him~
throughout all the coasts of Israel Abishag the Shunamite, to sleep with the~
king and to warm his aged body. Who is this Shunamite, wife and yet virgin, so~
hot, that she could heat the chilly, so holy, that her warmth provoked him not~
to lust Let Solomon the Wise explain his father's enjoyment, and the "Peaceful~
One" tell of the warrior's embraces. "Get wisdom, get understanding forget it~
not, neither decline from the words of my mouth forsake her not, and she shall~
preserve thee love her, and she shall keep thee. Wisdom is the principal thing~
therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting, get understanding. Exalt her, and~
she shall promote thee. Honour her, and she shall embrace thee, and shall give~
to thine head an ornament of grace. She shall compass thee like a crown of~
delights." (Prov. iv. 5-9.)

[Responsory4]
R. Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.
* Because the hand of the Lord was with him, he smote the Philistine, and took~
away the reproach from Israel.
V. Is not this David? Did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying~
Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
R. Because the hand of the Lord was with him, he smote the Philistine, and took~
away the reproach from Israel.

[Lectio5]
In old men almost all the powers of the body become weakened, and while wisdom~
only is increasing, all things else beside wisdom fail. Then faileth strength~
for fasting, for watching, for "chameuniae," (that is, sleeping on the floor,)~
for wandering hither and thither, for receiving strangers, for defending the~
poor, for instance and constancy in prayer, for visiting the sick, for that work~
with the hands whence alms are given. I need not treat of this with long talk,~
but, in short, when the body is broken down, all the works of the body wax~
enfeebled.

[Responsory5]
R. Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain upon~
you
* For there are the mighty of Israel fallen
V. All ye mountains that stand round about, the Lord look upon you but let Him~
pass by Gilboa
R. For there are the mighty of Israel fallen

[Lectio6]
Don't either do I say, on the other hand, that wisdom, which in many old men~
drivelleth into second childhood, is weak, or wanting in such of the young and~
stout, as win knowledge by work and earnest study, by holiness of life and~
instancy of prayer to the Lord Jesus, but this I do say, that the more spiritual~
faculties have in youth many wrestlings with the body to go through, and that,~
what with violent provocations to vice, and what with the sensual ticklings of~
the flesh, they are apt to be smothered like fire among green wood, and not able~
to blaze forth in all their brightness. But when old age cometh upon them, who~
have spent their youth in acquiring sound knowledge, and have meditated in the~
law of the Lord day and night, it hath this effect on them, to make them more~
learned by their increased years, more experienced by constant use, more wise,~
through the advance of time and, in short, doth offer them the rich harvest of~
their past diligence.

[Responsory6]
R. Thus saith the Lord I took thee out of thy father's house, and appointed thee~
to be ruler over My people, over Israel.
* And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, to establish thy kingdom for~
ever.
V. And I have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that~
are in the earth and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies.
R. And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, to establish thy kingdom for~
ever.
&Gloria
R. And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, to establish thy kingdom for~
ever.

Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kõnyvébõl
!Matt 7:15-21
Azon idõben mondá Jézus tanitványainak Óvakodjatok a hamis prófétáktól, kik~
juhok ruházatában jõnek hozzátok, belül pedig ragadozó farkasok. És igy tovább
_
Homily by St Hilary, Bishop of Poitiers.
!Comment, on Matth. ch. vi.
The Lord here warneth us that we must rate the worth of soft words and seeming~
meekness, by the fruits which they that manifest such things bring forth in~
their works, and that we should look, in order to see what a man is, not at his~
professions, but at his deeds. For there are many in whom sheep's clothing is~
but a mask to hide wolfish ravening. But "Do men gather grapes of thorns, or~
figs of thistles Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, but a~
corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit." Thus, the Lord teacheth us, is it with~
men also evil men bring not forth good fruits, and hereby are we to know them.~
Lip-service alone winneth not the kingdom of heaven, nor is every one that saith~
unto Christ, "Lord, Lord," an heir thereof.

@Tempora/Pent01-3:Responsory1

[Lectio8]
What use is there in calling the Lord, Lord? Would He not be Lord all the same,~
whether or not we called Him so What holiness is there in this ascription of a~
name, when the true way to enter into the kingdom of heaven is to do the will of~
our Father, Who is in heaven " Many will say to Me in that day Lord, Lord, have~
we not prophesied in thy Name " Already here doth the Lord rebuke the deceit of~
the false prophets, and the feigning of the hypocrites, who take glory to~
themselves because of the power of their words, their prophesying in teaching,~
their casting out of devils, and such-like mighty works.

[Responsory8]
@Tempora/Pent01-0:Responsory8

[Lectio9]
Because of all these things they promised unto themselves that they shall enter~
into the kingdom of heaven as though in their words and works any good thing~
were their own, and not all the mighty working of that God upon Whom they call,~
since reading bringeth knowledge of doctrine, and the Name of Christ driveth out~
devils. That which is needed on our part to win that blessed eternity, that of~
our own which we must give, is to will to do right, to turn away from all evil,~
to obey with our whole heart the commandments laid on us from heaven, and so to~
become the friends of God. It should be ours rather to do God's will, than to~
boast of God's power. And we must put off from us and thrust away such as are by~
their wicked works already estranged from His friendship.
&teDeum

[Ant 2]
Beware of false prophets, * which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly~
they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits. Alleluia.

[Versum 2]
V. The Lord reigneth He is clothed with majesty.
R. The Lord is clothed with strength, and hath girded Himself with power.

[Ant 3]
A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, * neither can a corrupt tree bring~
forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down~
and cast into the fire. Alleluia.

[Versum 3]
V. Let my prayer, O Lord, be set forth.
R. As incense before thee.
