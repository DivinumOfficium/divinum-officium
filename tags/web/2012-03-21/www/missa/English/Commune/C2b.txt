[Lectio]
Lesson from the second letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians
!2 Cor. 1:3-7
Brethren: Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort, Who comforts us in all our afflictions, that we also may be able to comfort those who are in any distress by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted by God. For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so also through Christ does our comfort abound. For whether we are afflicted, it is for your instruction and salvation; or whether we are comforted, it is for our comfort; which shows its efficacy in the endurance of the selfsame sufferings that we also suffer. And our hope for you is steadfast, knowing that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so will you also be of the comfort, in Christ Jesus our Lord.

[Evangelium]
Continuation ++ of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 16:24 - 27.
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone wishes to come after Me,~
let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me. For he who would~
save his life will lose it; but he who loses his life for My sake will find it.~
For what does it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, but suffer the loss~
of his own soul? For the Son of Man is to come with His angels in the glory of~
His Father, and then He will render to everyone according to His conduct.
