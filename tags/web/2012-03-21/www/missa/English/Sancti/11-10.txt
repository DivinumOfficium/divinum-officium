[Lectio]
Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus
!Ecclus 31:8 11.
Happy the man found without fault, who turns not aside after gain, nor puts his trust in money nor in treasures! Who is he, that we may praise him? For he has done wonders in his life. He has been tested by gold and come off safe, and this remains his glory forever; he could have sinned but did not, could have done evil but would not, so that his possessions are secure in the Lord, and the assembly of the Saints shall recount his alms.

[Graduale]
!Ps 91:12, 14.
The just man shall flourish like the palm tree, like a cedar of Lebanon shall he~
grow in the house of the Lord.
!Ps 91:3
V. To proclaim Your kindness at dawn and Your faithfulness throughout the night.~
Alleluia, alleluia.
!Jas 1:12
V. Blessed is the man who endures temptation; for when he has been tried, he~
will receive the crown of life. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 12:35-40
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples, Let your loins be girt about and your~
lamps burning, and you yourselves like men waiting for their master’s return~
from the wedding; so that when he comes and knocks, they may straight-way open~
to him. Blessed are those servants whom the master, on his return, shall find~
watching. Amen I say to you, he will gird himself, and will make them recline at~
table, and will come and serve them. And if he comes in the second watch, and if~
in the third, and fins them so, blessed are those servants! But of this be~
assured, that if the householder had known at what hour the thief was coming, he~
would certainly have watched, and not have let his house be broken into. You~
also must be ready, because at an hour that you do not expect, the Son of Man is~
coming.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 88:25
My faithfulness and My kindness shall be with him, and through My name shall his~
horn be exalted.
