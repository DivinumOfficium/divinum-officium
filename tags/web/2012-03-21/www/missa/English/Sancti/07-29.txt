Lesson from the second letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians
!2 Cor. 10:17-18; 11:1-2
Brethren: He who boasts, let him boast in the Lord. For he is not approved who commends himself, but he whom the Lord commends. Would to God that you could bear with a little of my foolishness! Nay, do bear with me! For I am jealous for you with a divine jealousy. For I betrothed you to one spouse, that I might present you a chaste virgin to Christ.

[Graduale]

in to You with gladness. Alleluia.

!Luke 10:38-42
At that time, Jesus entered a certain village; and a woman named Martha welcome~
Him to her house. And she had a sister called Mary, who also seated herself at~
the Lord’s feet, and listened to His word. But Martha was busy about much~
serving. Ad she came up and said, Lord, is it not concern of Yours that my~
sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her therefore to help me. But the Lord~
answered and said to her, Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about~
many things; and yet only one thing is needful. Mary has chosen the best part,~
and it will not be taken away from her.
