Lesson from the secons letter of St Paul the Apostle to Timotheus
!2 Tim. 2:8-10; 3:10-12
Beloved: Remember that Jesus Christ rose from the dead and was descended from David; this is my gospel, in which I suffer even to bonds, as a criminal. But the word of God in not bound. This is why I bear all things for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with heavenly glory. But you have closely followed my doctrine, my conduct, my purpose, my faith, my long-suffering, my love, my patience, my persecutions, my afflictions; such as befell me at Antioch, Iconium and Lystra - such persecutions as I suffered, and out of them all the Lord delivered me. And all who want to live piously in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.

[Graduale]
!Ps 91:13-14
The just man shall flourish like the palm tree, like a cedar of Lebanon shall he~
grow in the house of the Lord.
!Ps 91:3 
V. To proclaim Your kindness at dawn and Your faithfulness throughout~
the night. Alleluia, alleluia.
!James 1:12
V. Blessed is the man who endures temptation; for when he has been tried, he~
will receive the crown of life. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 10:1-9
At that time, the Lord appointed seventy-two others, and sent them forth two by~
two before Him into every town and place where He Himself was about to come. And~
He said to them, The harvest indeed is great, but the laborers are few. Pray~
therefore the Lord of the harvest to send forth laborers into His harvest. Go.~
Behold, I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves. Carry neither purse,~
nor wallet, nor sandals, and greet no one on the way. Whatever house you enter,~
first day, ‘Peace to this house!’ And if a son of peace be there, your peace~
will rest upon him; but if not, it will return to you. And remain in the same~
house, eating and drinking what they have; for the laborer deserves his wages.~
Do not go from house to house. And whatever town you enter, and they receive you,~
eat what is set before you, and cure the sick who are there, and say to them,~
‘The kingdom of God is at hand for you.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 88:25
My faithfulness and My kindness shall be with him, and through My name shall his~
horn be exalted.
