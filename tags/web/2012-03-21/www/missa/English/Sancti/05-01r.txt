!Col. 3:14-15, 17, 23-24
v. Brethren: Have charity, which is the bond of perfection. And let the peace of Christ rejoice in your hearts, wherein also you are called in one body: and be ye thankful. All whatsoever you do in word or in work, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to God and the Father by Him. Whatsoever you do, do it from the heart, as to the Lord, and not to men: knowing that you shall receive of the Lord the reward of inheritance. Serve ye the Lord Christ.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 13:54-58
v. At that time: Jesus coming into His country, He taught them in their synagogues, so that they wondered and said: How came this Man by this wisdom and miracles? Is not this the carpenter's Son? Is not His mother called Mary, and His brethren James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Jude: and His sisters, are they not all with us? Whence therefore hath He all these things? And they were scandalized in His regard. But Jesus said to them: A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house. And He wrought not many miracles there, because of their unbelief.
