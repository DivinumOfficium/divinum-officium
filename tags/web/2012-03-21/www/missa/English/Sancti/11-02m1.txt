Lesson from the first letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians
!1 Cor. 15:51-57
Brethren: Behold, I tell you a mystery: we shall all indeed rise, but we shall not all be changed - in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall rise incorruptible and we shall be changed. For this corruptible body must put on incorruption, and this mortal body must put on immortality. But when this mortal body put on immortality, then shall come to pass the word that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory! O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting? Now the sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the Law. But thanks be to God Who has given us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

[Graduale]
!4 Esd. 2:34-35
Eternal rest give to them, O Lord; and let perpetual light shine upon them.
!Ps 111:7
The just man shall be in everlasting remembrance; an evil report he shall not~
fear.
!Tractus
O Lord, absolve the souls of all the faithful departed from every bond of sin.
V. And by the help of Your grace may they be worthy to escape the sentence of~
vengeance.
V. And to enjoy all the beatitude of the light eternal.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 5:25-29
At that time, Jesus said to the multitudes of the Jews, Amen, amen, I say to you,~
the hour is coming, and now is here, when the dead shall hear the voice of the~
Son of God, and those who hear shall live. For as the Father has life in Himself,~
even so He has given to the Son also to have life in Himself; and He has granted~
Him power to render judgment, because He is Son of Man. Do not wonder at this,~
for the hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs shall hear the voice of~
the Son of God. And they who have done good shall come forth unto resurrection~
of life; but they who have done evil unto resurrection of judgment.

[Offertorium]
!  
O Lord, Jesus Christ, King of glory, deliver the souls of all the faithful~
departed from the pains of hell and the deep pit; deliver them from the lion's~
mouth, that hell engulf them not, nor they fall into darkness, but that Michael,~
the holy standard-bearer, bring them into the holy light
v. which You once promised to Abraham and his seed.
V. We offer You, O Lord, sacrifices and prayers of praise; accept them for those~
souls whom we this day commemorate; grant them, O Lord, to pass from death to~
the life
v. which You once promised to Abraham and his seed.

[Secreta]
Look with mercy, we beseech You, O Lord, upon the sacrificial gifts we offer for~
the souls of Your servants and handmaids, so that, to those upon whom You~
conferred the merits of Christian faith, You will also grant its reward.
$Per Dominum

[Communio]
!4 Esd. 2:35, 34.
May light eternal shine upon them, O Lord, with Your Saints forever, for You are~
kind.
V. Grant them eternal rest, O Lord; and let perpetual light shine upon them:~
with Your Saints forever, for You are kind.

[Postcommunio]
May the prayer of Your suppliants, O Lord, benefit the souls of Your servants~
and handmaids, that You may deliver them from all sins and make them sharers in~
Your redemption.
