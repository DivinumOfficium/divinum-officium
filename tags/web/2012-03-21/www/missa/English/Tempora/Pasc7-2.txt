Lesson from the Acts of Apostles
!Acts 8:14-17.
In those days, when the Apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John. On their arrival they prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit; for as yet He had not come upon any of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 10:1-10.
At that time, Jesus said to the Pharisees, Amen, amen, I say to you, he who~
enters not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up another way, is a thief~
and a robber. But he who enters by the door is shepherd of the sheep. To this~
man the gatekeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own~
sheep by name and leads them forth. And when he has let out his own sheep, he~
goes before them; and the sheep follow him because they know his voice. But a~
stranger they will not follow, but will flee from him, because they do not know~
the voice of strangers. This parable Jesus spike to them, but they did not~
understand what He was saying to them. Again, therefore, Jesus said to them,~
Amen, amen, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. All whoever have come are~
thieves and robbers; but the sheep have not heard them. I am the door. If anyone~
enter by Me he shall be safe, and shall go in and out, and shall find pastures.~
The thief comes only to steal, and slay, and destroy. I came that they may have~
life, and have it more abundantly.

!Ps 77:23-25
The Lord opened the doors of heaven; He rained manna upon them for food and gave~
