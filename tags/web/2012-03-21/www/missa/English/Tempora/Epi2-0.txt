Lesson from the Epistle of St. Paul to the Romans
!Rom 12:6-16
Brethren: We have gifts differing according to the grace that has been given us, such as prophecy to be used according to the proportion of faith; or ministry, in ministering; or he who teaches, in teaching; he who exhorts, in exhorting; he who gives, in simplicity; he who presides, with carefulness; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness. Let love be without pretense. Hate what is evil, hold to what is good. Love one another with honor. Be not slothful in zeal; be fervent in spirit, serving the Lord, rejoicing in hope. Be patient in tribulation, persevering in prayer. Share the needs of the saints, practicing hospitality. Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. Rejoice with those who rejoice; weep with those who weep. Be of one mind towards one another. Do not set your mind on high things but condescend to the lowly.

[Graduale]
!Ps 106:20-21
The Lord sent forth His word to heal them and to snatch them from destruction.
V. Let them give thanks to the Lord for His kindness and His wondrous deeds to~
the children of men. Alleluia, alleluia.
!Ps 148:2
Praise the Lord, all you His angels, praise Him, all you His hosts. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 2:1-11
At that time, a marriage took place at Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus~
was there. Now Jesus too was invited to the marriage, and also His disciples.~
And the wine having run short, the mother of Jesus said to Him, They have no~
wine. And Jesus said to her, What would you have me do, woman? My hour has not~
yet come. His mother said to the attendants, Do whatever He tells you. Now six~
stone water-jars were placed there, after the Jewish manner of purification,~
each holding two or three measures. Jesus said to them, Fill the jars with~
water. And they filled them to the brim. And Jesus said to them, Draw out now,~
and take to the chief steward. And they took it to him. Now when the chief~
steward had tasted the water after it had become wine, not knowing whence it was~
- though the attendants who had drawn the water knew, - the chief steward called~
the bridegroom, and said to him, Every man at first sets forth the good wine,~
and when they have drunk freely, then that which is poorer. But you have kept~
the good wine until now. This first of His signs Jesus worked at Cana of Galilee;~
and He manifested His glory, and His disciples believed in Him.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 65:1-2, 16.
Shout joyfully to God, all you on earth, sing praise to the glory of His name.~
Hear now, all you who fear God, while I declare what the Lord has done for me.~
Alleluia.

[Communio]
!John 2:7-11
The Lord said, Fill the jars with water and take to the chief steward. When the~
chief steward had tasted the water after it had become wine, he said to the~
bridegroom, You have kept the good wine until now. This first miracle Jesus~
worked in the presence of His disciples.

[Postcommunio]
O Lord, we beseech You that the effects of Your power may ever increase within~
us; and, strengthened by the divine sacrament, we may be prepared by Your grace~
to lay hold of what it promises.
