Lesson from the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Colossians
!Col 3:12-17
Brethren: Put on, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, a heart of mercy, kindness, humility, meekness, patience. Bear with one another and forgive one another, if anyone has a grievance against any other; even as the Lord has forgiven you, so also do you forgive. But above all these things have charity, which is the bond of perfection. And may the peace of Christ reign in your hearts; unto that peace, indeed, you were called in one body. Show yourselves thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you abundantly: in all wisdom teach and admonish one another by psalms, hymns and spiritual songs, singing in your hearts to God by His grace. Whatever you do in word or in work, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to God the Father through Jesus Christ our Lord.

[Evangelium]
Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to St. Matthew
!Matt 13:24-30
At that time, Jesus spoke this parable to the crowds: The kingdom of heaven is~
like a man who sowed good seed in his field; but while men were asleep, his~
enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. And when the blade~
sprang up and brought forth fruit, then the weeds appeared as well. And the~
servants of the householder came and said to him, ‘Sir, did you not sow good~
seed in your field? How then does it have weeds?’ He said to them, ‘An enemy~
has done this.’ And the servants said to him, ‘Will you have us go and gather~
them up?’ ‘No,’ he said, ‘lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat~
along with them. Let both grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time I~
will say to the reapers: Gather up the weeds first, and bind them in bundles to~
burn; but gather the wheat into my barns.’

[Offertorium]
!Ps 117:16-17
The right hand of the lord has wrought strength; the right hand of the Lord has~
exalted me: I shall not die, but live, and shall declare the works of the Lord..
