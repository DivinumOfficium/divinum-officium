Lesson from the book of Isaias
!Isa. 2:2-5
In those days the prophet Isaiah said: In days to come, the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established as the highest mountain and raised above the hills. All nations shall stream toward it; many peoples shall come and say: ‘Come, let us climb the Lord’s mountain, to the house of the God of Jacob, that He may instruct us in His ways, and we may walk in His paths.’ For from Sion shall go forth instruction, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. He shall judge between the nations, and impose terms on many peoples. They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks; one nation shall not raise the sword against another, nor shall they train for war again. O house of Jacob, come, let us walk in the light of the Lord, our God.

[GradualeL1]
!Ps 23:7; 23:3-4
Lift up, O gates, your lintels; reach up, you ancient portals, that the King of~
glory may come in!
V.Who can ascend the mountain of the Lord? or who may stand in His holy place?~
He whose hands are sinless, whose heart is clean.

[OratioL1]
Hasten, we beseech You, O Lord, and delay not; bestow upon us the help of power~
from on high, that they who trust in Your goodness may be supported by the~
encouragement of Your coming.

Lesson from the book of Isaias
!Isa 7:10-15
In those days, the Lord spoke to Achaz: Ask for a sign from the Lord, your God; let it be deep as the nether world, or high as the sky! But Achaz answered, I will not ask! I will not tempt the Lord! Then he said, Listen, O house of David! Is it not enough for you to weary men, must you also weary my God? Therefore the Lord Himself will give you this sign: the virgin shall be with child, and bear a Son, and shall name Him Emmanuel. He shall be living on curds and honey by the time He learns to reject the bad and choose the good.

[Graduale]
!Ps 144:18, 21.
The Lord is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth.
V. May my mouth speak the praise of the Lord, and may all flesh bless His holy~
name.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 1:26-38
At that time, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee called~
Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph, of the house of David,~
and the virgin’s name was Mary. And when the angel had come to her, he said,~
Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women. When she~
had heard him she was troubled at his word, and kept pondering what manner of~
greeting this might be. And the angel said to her, Do not be afraid, Mary, for~
you have found grace with God. Behold, you shall conceive in your womb and shall~
bring forth a son; and you shall call His name Jesus. He shall be great, and~
shall be called the Son of the most High; and the Lord God will give Him the~
throne of David His father, and He shall be king over the house of Jacob forever;~
and of His kingdom there shall be no end. But Mary said to the angel, How shall~
this happen, since I do not know man? And the angel answered and said to her,~
The Holy Spirit shall come upon you, and the power of the Most High shall~
overshadow you, and therefore the Holy Once to be born shall be called the Son~
of God. And, behold, Elizabeth your kinswoman also has conceived a son in her~
old age, and she who was called barren is now in her sixth month; for nothing~
shall be impossible with God. But Mary said: Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be~
it done to me according to your word.

[Offertorium]
!Isa 35:4
Be strong, fear no longer! For, behold, our God will bring judgment. He Himself~
will come to save us.

[Secreta]
May our fasting, we beseech You, O Lord, be acceptable to You, and by its~
purifying power make us worthy of Your grace and bring us to the eternal bliss~
You have promised us.
