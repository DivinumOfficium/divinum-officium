Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Romans
!Rom 15:4-13
Brethren: Whatever things have been written have been written for our instruction, that through the patience and the consolation afforded by the Scriptures we may have hope. May then the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be of one mind towards one another according to Jesus Christ; that, on in spirit, you may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Wherefore receive one another, even as Christ has received you to the honor of God. For I say that Christ Jesus has been a minister of the circumcision in order to show God’s fidelity in confirming the promises made to our fathers, but that the Gentiles glorify God because of His mercy, as it is written, Therefore will I praise You among the Gentiles, and will sing to Your name. And again He says, Rejoice, you Gentiles, with His people. And again, Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles; and sing His praises, all you peoples. And again Isaias says, There shall be the root of Jesse, and He Who shall arise to rule the Gentiles... in Him the Gentiles shall hope. Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope and in the power of the Holy Spirit.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt. 11:2-10
At that time, when John had heard in prison of the works of Christ, he sent two~
of his disciples to say to Him, Are You He Who is to come, or shall we look for~
another? And Jesus answering said to them, Go and report to John what you have~
heard and seen: the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf~
hear, the dead rise, the poor have the gospel preached to them. And blessed is~
he who is not scandalized in Me. Then, as they went away, Jesus began to say to~
the crowds concerning John, What did you go out to the desert to see? A reed~
shaken by the wind? But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft~
garments? Behold, those who wear soft garments are in the houses of kings. But~
what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.~
This is he of whom it is written, ‘Behold, I send my messenger before Your face,~
who shall make ready Your way before You.’

[Offertorium]
!Ps 84:7-8
Will You not, O God, give us life; and shall not Your people rejoice in You?~
Show us, O Lord, Your kindness, and grant us Your salvation.

[Secreta]
Be appeased, we beseech You, O Lord, by the prayers and offerings of our human~
frailty, and where the support of our own merits is lacking, come to our~
assistance with Your protection.

disdain the things of earth and love those of heaven.
