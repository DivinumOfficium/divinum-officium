At that time, the shepherds were saying to one another, Let us go over to~
Bethlehem and see this thing that has come to pass, which the Lord has made~
known to us. So they went with haste, and the found Mary and Joseph, and the~
Babe lying in the manger. And when they had seen, they understood what had been~
told them concerning this Child. And all who heard marveled at the things told~
them by the shepherds. But Mary kept in mind all these things, pondering them in~
her heart. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all that~
they had heard and seen, even as it was spoken to them.
