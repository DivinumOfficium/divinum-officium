04-07# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 55: Concerning the Brethren’s Clothes and Shoes
_
Let there be given to the brethren clothing suitable to the character and climate of the place where they live, since in cold regions one wants more and in hot regions less; and this the abbot has to take into consideration: we however are of opinion that a cowl and a tunic each is sufficient for monks in temperate localities, in winter a cowl of shaggy stuff, in summer one of smooth stuff or one old and worn; together with a scapular for work; and, as covering for the feet, sandals and shoes. Concerning the colour or coarseness of all these things let not the monks trouble themselves, but let them be such as can be obtained in the province in which they live and that can be bought fairly cheaply: but as to the size of the garments let the abbot have a care that they be not too small, but of proper size for the wearers. When receiving new clothes let them always at the same time return the old to be put away in the wardrobe for the poor; for it suffices a monk to have two tunics and two cowls, two instead of one, to provide for having to wash them and for night-wear; for anything in excess of this ought to be taken away as superfluous. And similarly shoes and anything else that is old let them give back when they receive new ones. Let those who are sent on a journey receive drawers from the wardrobe and take them back washed on their return. And let there be cowls and tunics somewhat better than they usually have, which those going on a journey may receive from the wardrobe and take back on their return.
