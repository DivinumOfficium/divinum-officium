Look forgivingly on thy flock, Eternal Shepherd, and keep it in thy constant protection, by the intercession of blessed Soter and Caius thy Martyrs and Sovereign Pontiffs, whom thou didst constitute Shepherd of the whole Church.

Soter, a countryman of Fondi in Campania, succeeded the holy martyr Anicete, (in~
the year 173.) It was he who ordained that nuns should not touch the sacred~
vessels and linen of the Altar, nor serve with the incense in the Church. He~
ordained likewise, that on the anniversary of the Lord's Supper, every one~
should receive the Body of Christ, except those who were forbidden to do so on~
account of grievous sin. He sat as Pope three years, eleven months, and~
twenty-eight days. He ordained in the month of December eighteen Priests, nine~
Deacons, and eleven Bishops for divers places. He was crowned with martyrdom~
under the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, (in 177,) and was buried after the manner of~
them that had gone before him, in the Cemetery, which was afterwards called that~
of St Calixtus.

Gaius was a Dalmatian and a kinsman of the Emperor Diocletian (and succeeded~
holy Eutychian in the year 283.) It was he who ordained that the following~
should be the order of degrees in the Church through which all should pass~
before they be made Bishop First, Doorkeeper second, Reader third,~
Exorcist fourth, Acolyte fifth, Subdeacon sixth, Deacon seventh, Priest.~
Caius fled from the cruelties practised by Diocletian against the Christians,~
and lay hid for a while in a cave, but after eight years he and his brother~
Gabinus won the crown of martyrdom, (upon the 21st day of April, in the year~
296.) At that time he had sat in the chair of Peter twelve years, four months,~
and five days, and had ordained in the month of December twenty - five Priests,~
eight Deacons, and five Bishops. He was buried in the Cemetery of Calixtus upon~
the twenty-second day of April. It was Urban VIII. who renewed the memorial of~
him in the city, rebuilt his Church, which had been in ruins, and distinguished~
it by making it one of those whence the Cardinals take their titles, and of~
those which are called " Stations," and enriching it with the reliques of the~
Saint.

[Lectio6]
From the sermon of Saint Ambrose Episcopus.
!Sermon 22. 
Dearly beloved brethren,~
it is very meet and right that after the gladness of Easter, which we have~
celebrated in the Church, we should mingle our own joy with the joy of the holy~
Martyrs yea, that we should tell of the glory of the Lord's rising again, to~
them that have been made partakers of the Lord's sufferings. It truly must needs~
be that they which have been partakers of His sufferings, should be also of His~
joy. For thus saith the blessed Apostle " As ye are partakers of the~
sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation." (2 Cor. i. 7.) And again "~
If we suffer, we shall also reign with Him." (2 Tim. ii. 12.) He, therefore,~
that endureth sorrow for Christ, must needs also have glory with Christ.
