Olvasmány Izaiás próféta könyvébõl
!Isa 26:1-6
1 Azon a napon ezt az éneket éneklik Júda földjén: Erõs várunk van, védelmül~
kõfal és bástya szolgál.
2 Nyissátok ki a kapukat! Hadd vonuljon be az igaz nemzet, amely mindvégig~
hûséges,
3 amelynek szíve állhatatos és megõrzi a békét, mert benned van bizalma.
4 Bízzatok az Úrban örökkön-örökké, mert az Úr örökké megmaradó Szikla!
5 Letaszította a magasban lakókat, és a büszke várost megalázta, és földig~
alázta, a porba sújtotta,
6 úgyhogy most láb tiporja, a szegények lába, a szûkölködõk talpa.

[Responsory1]
R. Behold, the Lord shall appear upon a white cloud,
* And ten thousand of His saints with Him; and He shall have on His vesture, and~
on His thigh a name written King of kings, and Lord of lords.
V. He shall appear and not lie; though He tarry, wait for Him, because He will~
surely come.
R. And ten thousand of His saints with Him; and He shall have on His vesture,~
and on His thigh a name written King of kings, and Lord of lords.

[Lectio2]
!Isa 26:7-10
7 Egyenes az igazak útja, az igaz ember ösvényét te egyengeted.
8 Ítéleteid útját jártuk s benned reméltünk, Urunk. Neved és emlékezeted után~
vágyódott a lelkünk.
9 Utánad vágyódik éjszaka a szívem, s téged keres a lelkem bensõmben. Mert ha~
ítéleted utoléri a földet, a mindenség lakói megtanulják az igazságot.
10 Ha kegyelmet kap az istentelen, nem tanulja meg az igazságot. Az igazak~
földjén is gonoszságot mûvel, s nem törõdik az Úr fölségével.

[Responsory2]
R. Thou, Bethlehem, art the city of the Most High God, out of thee shall He come~
forth That is to be Ruler in Israel; Whose goings forth have been from of old,~
from everlasting, and now shall He be great unto the ends of the earth.
* And this Man shall be the peace in our land, when He shall come.
V. He shall speak peace unto the Gentiles, and shall have dominion from sea to~
sea.
R. And this Man shall be the peace in our land, when He shall come.

[Lectio3]
!Isa 26:11-14
11 Uram, magasra emeled a kezed, de õk nem látják meg. Majd egyszer meglátják,~
mennyire szereted ezt a népet, és megszégyenülnek; az ellenségeidnek készített~
tûz megemészti õket.
12 Uram, te békességet adsz nekünk, mert ahogy tetteinkkel megérdemeljük, úgy~
bánsz velünk.
13 Urunk, Istenünk! Más urak parancsoltak nekünk, nem te, de mi csak a te~
nevedet dicsérjük.
14 A holtak nem kelnek életre s az árnyak nem támadnak fel, mert megbüntetted s~
megsemmisítetted õket, még az emléküket is eltörölted.

[Responsory3]
R. He That shall come, will come, and will not tarry; and there shall no more be~
fear in our borders.

V. He shall tread down all our iniquities, and cast all our sins into the~
depths of the sea.
R. For He is our Saviour.
&Gloria
R. For He is our Saviour.

From the Sermons of Pope St Leo (the Great)
!Second on the December Fast, and Almsgiving
Dearly beloved brethren, with the care which becometh us as the shepherd of your~
souls, we urge upon you the rigid observance of this December Fast. The month of~
December hath come round again, and with it this devout custom of the Church.~
The fruits of the year, which is drawing to a close, are now all gathered in,~
and we most meetly offer our abstinence to God as a sacrifice of thanksgiving.~
And what can be more useful than fasting, that exercise by which we draw nigh to~
God, make a stand against the devil, and overcome the softer enticements of sin?

[Responsory4]
R. Weep not, O Egypt, for the Ruler cometh unto thee, and the depths shall be~
moved at His presence.
* To deliver His people out of the hand of the mighty.
V. Behold, the Lord of hosts, thy God, cometh with great power.
R. To deliver His people out of the hand of the mighty.

[Lectio5]
Fasting hath ever been the bread of strength. From abstinence proceed pure~
thoughts, reasonable desires, and healthy counsels. By voluntary mortifications~
the flesh dieth to lust, and the soul is renewed in might. But since fasting is~
not the only mean whereby we get health for our souls, let us add to our fasting~
works of mercy. Let us spend in good deeds what we take from indulgence. Let our~
fast become the banquet of the poor.

[Responsory5]
R. Her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged. 
* Lord shall have mercy on Jacob, and Israel shall be saved.
V. Turn again, O Virgin of Israel, turn again to thy cities.
R. For the Lord shall have mercy on Judah, and Israel shall be saved.

[Lectio6]
Let us defend the widow and serve the orphan; let us comfort the afflicted and~
reconcile the estranged; let us take in the wanderer and succour the oppressed;~
let us clothe the naked and cherish the sick. And may every one of us that shall~
offer to the God of all goodness this Advent sacrifice of fasting and alms be by~
Him fitted to receive an eternal reward in His heavenly kingdom! We fast on~
Wednesday and Friday; and there is likewise a Vigil on Saturday at the Church of~
St Peter, that by his good prayers we may the more effectually obtain what we~
ask for, through our Lord Jesus Christ, Who with the Father and the Holy Ghost,~
liveth and reigneth, one God, world without end. Amen.

[Responsory6]
R. The Lord shall come down like rain upon a fleece.
* In His days shall righteousness flourish, and abundance of peace.
V. All the kings of the earth shall fall down before Him, all nations shall~
serve Him.
R. In His days shall righteousness flourish, and abundance of peace.
&Gloria
R. In His days shall righteousness flourish, and abundance of peace.

Evangélium szent János Apostol kõnyvébõl
!John 1:19-28
Azon idõben a zsidók papokat és levitákat küldtek hozzá Jeruzsálembõl, s~
megkérdeztették: "Ki vagy?" És így tovább.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great)
!7th on the Gospels.
Dearly beloved brethren, the first thing which striketh us in to - day's Gospel~
is the lowly - mindedness of John. He was so great that it was thought he might~
be the Christ; yet he soberly chose rather to seem only what he really was, than~
to let the belief of men invest him with a dignity which did not belong to him;~
for he confessed, and denied not, but confessed, I am not the Christ, at the~
same time he would not deny what he was in reality; and thus his very truth~
speaking made him a member of Him Whose title he would not by falsehood take. In~
that he arrogated not to himself the name of Christ, he became a member of~
Christ. While he humbly strove to confess his own weakness, he earned by his~
simplicity a part in the grandeur of his Master.

[Responsory7]
R. O Lord, come and make no tarrying; loosen the bonds of thy people.
* And gather again into their own land them that are scattered abroad.
V. O Lord, stir up thy strength, and come and save us.
R. And gather again into their own land them that are scattered abroad.

[Lectio8]
In considering this subject we find an apparent contradiction between one of~
John's statements, and the saying of our Redeemer recorded in another part of~
the Gospel. (Matth. xvii. 10-12.) When His disciples asked our Lord regarding~
the coming of Elias, He answered Elias is come already, and they knew him not,~
but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. And if ye will receive it, this~
(that is, John) is Elias. (Matth. xi. 14.) But when John was asked if he was~
Elias, he answered, I am not. How comes it then, dearly beloved brethren, that~
we find the Truth Itself asserting what the prophet of the Truth denied? It must~
evidently be that our Lord meant one thing and John another, when the Lord said,~
This is, and John, I am not. For how can he be the prophet of truth, if he speak~
not according to the word of Him Who is the Eternal Truth?

[Responsory8]
R. Behold, there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall come for salvation unto~
the people, to it shall the Gentiles seek
* And His name shall be glorious.
V. The Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of His father David, and He~
shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever.
R. And His name shall be glorious.

[Lectio9]
Let us then more minutely examine these words, and we shall find that there is~
no real contradiction. When the Angel announced to Zacharias the coming birth of~
John he said He shall go before Him in the spirit and power of Elias, (Luke i.~
17.) As the old Elias will come again before the Second Advent of the Lord, so~
did John, as the new Elias, go before the First Advent, in the spirit and power~
of Elias. As the old Elias will be the Fore-runner of the Judge, so the new~
Elias was the Fore-runner of the Saviour. John then was Elias in spirit, but not~
in person; and our Lord asserteth of the spirit what John denieth of the person.

[Responsory9]
R. The Lord will teach us of His ways, and we will walk in His paths.
* For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from~
Jerusalem.
V. Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of~
the God of Jacob.
R. For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from~
Jerusalem.
&Gloria
R. For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from~
Jerusalem.
