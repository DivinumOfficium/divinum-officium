04-14# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 60: Concerning Priests Who By Chance Shall Wish to Live In the Monastery
_
If anyone in the ranks of the priesthood shall ask that he be received into the monastery, even to him let not consent be given too quickly; yet if he persist consistently in this his petition, let him know that he will have to keep the whole discipline of the rule and that nothing will be relaxed specially for him, according as it is written: “Friend, wherefore hast thou come?” Let it however be conceded to him to take his place next to the abbot and to bless and to say Mass provided the abbot so order him; but otherwise let him on no account in anywise presume, knowing himself subject to the discipline of the rule and that he may the better set an example of humility to all. If by chance there shall be in the monastery occasion to deliberate on any matter of regulation or on any kind of business, let him expect to occupy then that place which may be his by seniority, not that which was conceded to him out of reverence for his priesthood. And if any clerics with like desire wish to be incorporated into the monastery let them be allocated to an intermediate position, but only if each makes promise concerning his own stability and observance of the rule.
