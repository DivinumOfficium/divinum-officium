From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 24:15-35
At that time Jesus said unto his disciples: When ye shall see the abomination~
of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the Prophet, stand in the Holy Place, (whoso~
readeth, let him understand,) And so on.
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Bk. iv. Comm. on Matth. xxiv.
This injunction to whoso readeth, to understand, showeth that there is here~
something mysterious. In Daniel we read as followeth And in the midst of the~
week the sacrifice and the oblations shall be taken away and in the temple~
there shall be the abomination of desolation, even until the consummation of the~
time and a consummation shall be given to the desolation." (ix. 27.) It is~
of this same thing that the Apostle speaketh, when he saith that a man of~
iniquity, even an adversary, shall be exalted against whatsoever is called God,~
or is worshipped so that he shall even dare to stand in the temple of God, and~
to show himself as God whose coming shall, according to the working of Satan,~
destroy and banish away from God all who shall receive him.

[Lectio8]
This prophecy may be understood either (first) simply of Antichrist, (secondly)~
of the statue of Caesar, which Pilate set up in the Temple, or (thirdly) of the~
statue of Hadrian on horse-back, which hath stood, even until our own day,~
upon the site of the Holy of Holies. In the Scriptures of the Old Testament~
"abomination" is a word very often used for an idol, and the farther title "of~
desolation" is added to identify an idol erected upon the site of the desolate~
and ruined temple.

[Lectio9]
But we may also understand by the abomination of desolation, any bad doctrine~
and when we see such a thing get a standing in the Holy Place, that is, in the~
Church, and showing itself that it is God, that is, pretending that it is His~
revealed truth, then will be the time when it will be our duty to flee from~
Judea into the mountains, that is to say, to leave the letter, which passeth~
away, and all guise of Jewish superstition, and to hie us unto the everlasting~
hills, from whence God doth right wondrously cause His light to shine forth.~
(Ps. lxxv. 5.) Then will it be our duty to find ourselves under a roof and in an~
house, wherethrough the fiery darts of the wicked one can never pierce to smite~
us, and not to come down to take anything out of the house of our old~
conversation, or to have regard unto those things which are behind but rather~
to sow in the field of the spiritual Scriptures, that we may reap thereof a~
bountiful harvest neither to have two coats, that thing forbidden to Apostles.~
(Matth. x. 10.)

[Ant 2]
When ye shall see the abomination of desolation, * spoken of by Daniel the~
Prophet, stand in the Holy Place, (whoso readeth, let him understand)

[Versum 2]
V. The Lord reigneth He is clothed with majesty.
R. The Lord is clothed with strength, and hath girded Himself with power.

[Ant 3]
Amen I say unto you, this generation shall not pass till all these things be~
fulfilled * heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away,~
saith the Lord.

[Versum 3]
V. Let my prayer, O Lord, be set forth.
R. As incense before thee.

Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 24:15-35
24:15 When therefore you shall see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place: he that readeth let him understand.
24:16 Then they that are in Judea, let them flee to the mountains:
24:17 And he that is on the housetop, let him not come down to take any thing out of his house:
24:18 And he that is in the field, let him not go back to take his coat.
24:19 And woe to them that are with child, and that give suck in those days.
24:20 But pray that your flight be not in the winter, or on the sabbath.
24:21 For there shall be then great tribulation, such as hath not been from the beginning of the world until now, neither shall be.
24:22 And unless those days had been shortened, no flesh should be saved: but for the sake of the elect those days shall be shortened.
24:23 Then if any man shall say to you: Lo here is Christ, or there, do not believe him.
24:24 For there shall arise false Christs and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders, insomuch as to deceive (if possible) even the elect.
24:25 Behold I have told it to you, beforehand.
24:26 If therefore they shall say to you: Behold he is in the desert, go ye not out: Behold he is in the closets, believe it not.
24:27 For as lightning cometh out of the east, and appeareth even into the west: so shall the coming of the Son of man be.
24:28 Wheresoever the body shall be, there shall the eagles also be gathered together.
24:29 And immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven shall be moved:
24:30 And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all tribes of the earth mourn: and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with much power and majesty.
24:31 And he shall send his angels with a trumpet, and a great voice: and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the farthest parts of the heavens to the utmost bounds of them.
24:32 And from the fig tree learn a parable: When the branch thereof is now tender, and the leaves come forth, you know that summer is nigh.
24:33 So you also, when you shall see all these things, know ye that it is nigh, even at the doors.
24:34 Amen I say to you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done.
24:35 Heaven and earth shall pass, but my words shall not pass.
