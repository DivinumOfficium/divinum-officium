From the holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 21:33-46
In that time Jesus said to the multitude of Jews and the chief priests: Hear ye~
another parable. There was a man an householder, who planted a vineyard, and~
made a hedge round about it. And so on.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!Bk. ix. on Luke xx.
Many derive divers spiritual meanings from the term vineyard, but Isaias giveth~
us to know that the vineyard of the Lord of Sabaoth is the house of Israel, (v.~
7.) Who but God planted that vineyard? He it was that let it out to husbandmen,~
and went into a far country; not that the Lord, Who is everywhere present,~
moveth from place to place; but because He is nigh unto them that seek Him, and~
from such as regard Him not He standeth afar off. For a long time He tarried~
away, lest He might seem to ask too early for the fruits of His vineyard. For~
where kindness is greatest, there ingratitude is worst.

Therefore it is well written in Matthew, for our instruction, that He hedged it~
round about, that is, He girded it with the fortifications of His own Divine~
protection, that it might not easily lie open to the ravages of spiritual wild~
beasts. And digged a wine-press in it. What sense are we to put upon the~
wine-press, unless it be that the Psalms are here described under that title,~
because in them the mysteries of the Lord's Passion flow over like new wine,~
working under the power of the Holy Ghost? Whence also, they upon whom the Holy~
Ghost was outpoured were deemed to be drunken (Acts ii. 13.) God therefore~
digged a wine-press, whereinto the reasonable grapes of inward fruitfulness~
poured their spiritual richness.

And built a tower that is, He raised up the goodly structure of the Law. And so~
this His vineyard, thus fortified, furnished, and garnished, He gave over to the~
Jews. And when the time of the fruit drew near, He sent His servants to the~
husbandmen. Well doth He call it the time of the fruit, not the time of the~
in-gathering. For the Jews yielded Him no fruit; the Lord had no ingathering~
from that vineyard of which He said: When I looked that it should bring forth~
grapes, it brought forth wild grapes. (Isa. v. 4.) Not that wine that maketh~
glad the heart of man, not with the new wine of the spirit, reeked that~
wine-press, but with the blood of the Prophets, brutally shed.

[Ant 2]
He will miserably destroy * those wicked men, and will let out His vineyard unto~
other husbandmen, which shall render Him the fruits in their seasons.

[Oratio 2]
O Almighty God, grant, we beseech thee, that the Sacred Fast may so cleanse us~
that thereby Thou mayest make us to come with clean hearts unto those holy~
ordinances l which are now before us.

[Ant 3]
When they sought * to lay hands on Him, they feared the multitude, because they~
took Him for a Prophet.

[Oratio 3]
Grant unto thy people, O Lord, we beseech thee, soundness both of mind and body,~
that they, cleaving ever unto good works, may evermore worthily be defended by~
the shield of thine Almighty arm.

v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 21:33-46
21:33 Hear ye another parable. There was a man an householder, who planted a vineyard, and made a hedge round about it, and dug in it a press, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen; and went into a strange country.
21:34 And when the time of the fruits drew nigh, he sent his servants to the husbandmen that they might receive the fruits thereof.
21:35 And the husbandmen laying hands on his servants, beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.
21:36 Again he sent other servants more than the former; and they did to them in like manner.
21:37 And last of all he sent to them his son, saying: They will reverence my son.
21:38 But the husbandmen seeing the son, said among themselves: This is the heir: come, let us kill him, and we shall have his inheritance.
21:39 And taking him, they cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him.
21:40 When therefore the lord of the vineyard shall come, what will he do to those husbandmen?
21:41 They say to him: He will bring those evil men to an evil end; and will let out his vineyard to other husbandmen, that shall render him the fruit in due season.
21:42 Jesus saith to them: Have you never read in the Scriptures: The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner? By the Lord this has been done; and it is wonderful in our eyes.
21:43 Therefore I say to you, that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and shall be given to a nation yielding the fruits thereof.
21:44 And whosoever shall fall on this stone, shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it shall grind him to powder.
21:45 And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they knew that he spoke of them.
21:46 And seeking to lay hands on him, they feared the multitudes: because they held him as a prophet.
