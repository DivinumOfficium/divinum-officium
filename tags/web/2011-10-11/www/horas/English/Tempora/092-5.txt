Lesson from the book of Job
!Job  40:1-5
1  And the Lord answering Job out of the whirlwind, said
2  Gird up thy loins like a man I will ask thee, and do thou tell me.
3  Wilt thou make void my judgment and condemn me, that thou mayst be justified?
4  And hast thou an arm like God, and canst thou thunder with a voice like him?
5  Clothe thyself with beauty, and set thyself up on high and be glorious, and put on goodly garments.

!Job 40:6-11
6  Scatter the proud in thy indignation, and behold every arrogant man, and humble him.
7  Look on all that are proud, and confound them, and crush the wicked in their place.
8  Hide them in the dust together, and plunge their faces into the pit.
9  Then I will confess that thy right hand is able to save thee.
10  Behold behemoth whom I made with thee, he eateth grass like an ox.
11  His strength is in his loins, and his force in the navel of his belly.

!Job 42:1-6
1  Then Job answered the Lord, and said
2  I know that thou canst do all things, and no thought is hid from thee.
3  Who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge? Therefore I have spoken unwisely, and things that above measure exceeded my knowledge.
4  Hear, and I will speak I will ask thee, and do thou tell me.
5  With the hearing of the ear, I have heard thee, but now my eye seeth thee.
6  Therefore I reprehend myself, and do penance in dust and ashes.
