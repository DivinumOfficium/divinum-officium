[Lectio]
Olvasmány Malakiás próféta könyvébõl
!Mal 3:1-4
v. Nézzétek, elküldöm hírnökömet, hogy elkészítse elõttem az utat. Hamarosan belép szentélyébe az Úr, akit kerestek, és a szövetség angyala, aki után vágyakoztok. Lám, már jön is! - mondja a Seregek Ura.  De ki fogja tudni elviselni jövetele napját? És ki maradhat állva, amikor megjelenik? Mert olyan, mint az olvasztók tüze és a ványolók lúgja.  Leül, mint az ezüstolvasztó és -tisztító mester. Megtisztítja Lévi fiait, megfinomítja õket, mint az aranyat és az ezüstöt, hogy méltóképpen mutassák be az áldozatot az Úrnak.  Júda és Jeruzsálem áldozata tetszeni fog akkor az Úrnak, éppúgy, mint a régmúlt idõkben, mint az elsõ években. 

[Graduale]
!Ps 47:10-11, 9.
O God, we ponder Your kindness within Your temple. As Your name, O God, so also Your praise reaches to the ends of the earth.
V. As we have heard so have we seen, in the city of our God, in His holy mountain.Allelúja, allelúja.
V. The old man bore the Child, but the Child was the old man's King; Allelúja.

[Tractus]
!Ps 47:10-11, 9.
O God, we ponder Your kindness within Your temple. As Your name, O God, so also Your praise reaches to the ends of the earth.
V. As we have heard so have we seen, in the city of our God, in His holy mountain.
!Luke 2:29-32
Now You dismiss Your servant, O Lord, according to Your word, in peace.
V. Because my eyes have seen Your salvation.
V. Which You have prepared before the face of all peoples.
V. A light of revelation to the Gentiles, and a glory for Your people Israel.

[Evangelium]
Evangélium + szent Lukács Evangélista kõnyvébõl
!Luke 2:22-32
v. Amikor elteltek a tisztulásnak a Mózes törvényében megszabott napjai, felvitték Jeruzsálembe, hogy bemutassák az Úrnak,  ahogy az Úr törvényében elõ volt írva: az anyaméhet megnyitó minden elsõszülött fiú az Úr szentjének hívatik,  s az áldozatot is be akarták mutatni, ahogy az Úr törvénye elõírta: egy pár gerlicét vagy két galambfiókát.  Íme, volt Jeruzsálemben egy Simeon nevû igaz és istenfélõ ember. Várta Izrael vigaszát, és a Szentlélek volt rajta.  Kinyilatkoztatást kapott a Szentlélektõl, hogy addig nem hal meg, amíg meg nem látja az Úr Fölkentjét.  A Lélek indítására a templomba ment. Amikor a szülõk a gyermek Jézust bevitték, hogy a törvény elõírásának eleget tegyenek,  karjába vette és áldotta az Istent ezekkel a szavakkal:  "Most bocsásd el, Uram, szolgádat, szavaid szerint békében,  mert látta szemem üdvösségedet,  melyet minden nép színe elõtt készítettél,  világosságul a pogányok megvilágosítására, és dicsõségül népednek, Izraelnek." 

[Offertorium]
!Ps 44:3
Grace is poured out upon your lips; thus God has blessed you forever, and for ages of ages.

[Secreta]
O Lord, heed our prayer, and give us the help of Your loving kindness so that the gifts we offer before the eyes of Your majesty may be worthy of You.

[Communio]
!Luke 2:26
It was revealed to Simeon by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Christ of the Lord.

We beseech You, O Lord our God, that the sacrament You have given as the bulwark of our atonement may be made a saving remedy for us in this life and in the life to come.
