[Lectio1]
From the letter of blessed Apostle Paul to the Romans
!Rom 3:19-22
19 Now we know, that what things soever the law speaketh, it speaketh to them~
that are in the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be~
made subject to God.
20 Because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before him. For~
by the law is the knowledge of sin.
21 But now without the law the justice of God is made manifest, being witnessed~
by the law and the prophets.
22 Even the justice of God, by faith of Jesus Christ, unto all and upon all them~
that believe in him: for there is no distinction:

!Rom 3:23-26
23 For all have sinned, and do need the glory of God.
24 Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption, that is in~
Christ Jesus,
25 Whom God hath proposed to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to~
the shewing of his justice, for the remission of former sins,
26 Through the forbearance of God, for the shewing of his justice in this time;~
that he himself may be just, and the justifier of him, who is of the faith of~
Jesus Christ.

[Lectio3]
!Rom 3:27-31
27 Where is then thy boasting? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but by~
the law of faith.
28 For we account a man to be justified by faith, without the works of the law.
29 Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the~
Gentiles also.
30 For it is one God, that justifieth circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision~
through faith.
31 Do we, then, destroy the law through faith? God forbid: but we establish the~
law.
