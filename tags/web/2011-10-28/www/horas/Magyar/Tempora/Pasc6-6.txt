Szent Judás Apostol levelének kezdete
!Jude 1:1-4
1 Júdás, Jézus Krisztusnak a szolgája, Jakabnak meg a testvére, az Atyaistenben szeretett és a Jézus Krisztusnak megtartott meghívottaknak. 
2 Irgalomban, békében és szeretetben bõven legyen részetek! 
3 Szeretteim, minden igyekezettel azon vagyok, hogy közös üdvösségünkrõl írjak nektek. Szükségesnek véltem, hogy írásban kérjelek titeket, küzdjetek a hitért, amely egyszer s mindenkorra szóló öröksége a szenteknek. 
4 Mert bizonyos emberek befurakodtak közétek, akiknek az ítéletük már rég megíratott; ezek az istentelenek Istenünk kegyelmét kicsapongásra fordítják, az egyetlen Urat, Urunkat, Jézus Krisztust pedig megtagadják.

!Jude 1:5-8
5 Emlékezetetekbe szeretném idézni, bár egyszer s mindenkorra tudtok mindent, hogy az Úr Egyiptomból kiszabadította a népet, de késõbb azokat, akik nem hittek, elpusztította. 
6 Az angyalokat is, akik nem becsülték meg méltóságukat, elhagyták lakóhelyüket, a nagy nap ítéletére örök bilincsekben, sötétségben tartja. 
7 Ugyanígy Szodoma és Gomorra, valamint a szomszédos városok, amelyek hozzájuk hasonlóan kicsapongó életet éltek, és természetellenes gyönyöröket hajhásztak, intõ példák a számunkra: az örök tûz lett a büntetésük. 
8 Ennek ellenére ezek az álmodozók is ugyanúgy megfertõzik a testet, megvetik az (isteni) fölséget, káromolják az (égi) hatalmasságokat,

!Jude 1:9-13
9 jóllehet még Mihály fõangyal sem mert káromló ítéletet kimondani, amikor Mózes holtteste miatt heves vitába szállt a sátánnal, csak ennyit mondott: "Büntessen meg az Úr!" 
10 Ezek pedig káromolják azt, amit nem ismernek; azok meg, amiket mint az oktalan állatok, ösztönösen ismernek, romlásukra válnak. 
11 Jaj nekik, mert Káin útján járnak, haszonlesésbõl Bileám tévedésébe esnek, és mint Korach, halálukat lelik a lázadásban. 
12 Ezek szennyfoltok szeretetlakomáitokon, akik nem szégyellnek veletek enni, és csak hizlalják magukat; széltõl ûzött, esõtlen felhõk; kétszeresen kiszáradt, gyökerestül kitépett, késõ õszi, gyümölcstelen fák; 
13 saját gyalázatukat tajtékzó, vad tengeri hullámok; bolygó csillagok, amelyekre az örök sötétség homálya vár.

From the Treatise upon the Creed, addressed to Catechumens by St Austin, Bishop~
of Hippo.
!Bk. iv. ch. I. torn. 9.
We are yet the unborn offspring of a great Mother. Our Holy Mother the Church~
hath by the most sacred sign of the Cross received you into her womb, and from~
thence she is now just about to bring you forth, as she hath already brought~
forth your brethren, with thrills of spiritual joy. But until, through the~
washing of regeneration, she bringeth you forth into true light, she feedeth you~
in her womb with such food as becometh your condition, and in gladness matureth~
her children for the glad moment of her delivery. This Mother is not stricken by~
the doom of Eve, to bring forth children in sorrow, and they themselves~
oftenertimes weeping than laughing. Rather doth your spiritual Mother annul the~
sentence of your earthly Eve, by disobedience, endowed her offspring with~
death the Church, by obedience, giveth them newness of life. All the mystic~
prayers and ceremonies which have been and are still being performed over you by~
the ministry of the servants of God, exorcisms, prayers, spiritual songs,~
onbreathings, haircloth, prostrations, baring of the feet, the dread which ye~
feel, albeit so safe, all these things, I say unto you, are the nourishment~
which ye are ever. drawing from your Mother while yet ye are in her womb, that~
at the baptismal birth she may be able to present you strong and laughing babes~
unto Christ.

[Lectio5]
We have also received the Creed, which is the shield of the travailing Mother~
against the venom of the dragon. In the Apocalypse of the Apostle John (xii. 4)~
it is written "And the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be~
delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born." That this dragon is~
the devil ye all know. Ye know likewise that by the woman is signified the~
Virgin Mary, who, herself a Virgin, bore our Virgin Head, and who is revealed~
unto us as a type of the Holy Church, in that, even as Mary, though she bore a~
Son, remained a Virgin, so the Church doth in all times give birth to all her~
members, and yet is ever presented a chaste virgin to Christ. I have undertaken,~
with the help of the Lord, to expound every clause of the Creed, that I may~
bring home to your understandings what each containeth. Your hearts are ready,~
for the enemy hath been shut out of your hearts.

[Lectio6]
We have made profession of renouncing the enemy. At the moment of that~
profession it was not before men only, but in the presence of God and His Angels~
that ye said " I do renounce him." Renounce him, not only in your words, but~
in your ways not only with your voices, but with your lives not only with~
your lips, but in your works. Know ye well that the wrestling which ye have~
undertaken is a strife with an enemy who is subtle, and old, and patient now~
that ye have once renounced him, let him never again find in you his works~
never again give him the right to bring you into bondage. O Christian thou~
wilt be caught and exposed, if thou dost one thing and professest another if~
thou art faithful in name, and makest it to be evident by thy works that thou~
hast broken the faith pledged by this promise if some while thou goest into a~
church to pray, and anon to the shows to join in applauding obscene~
representations. What hast thou to do any more with the pomps of the devil,~
which thou hast renounced

Evangélium szent János könyvébõl
!John 14:15-21
Azon idõben mondá Jézus tanítványainak: Ha szerettek, tartsátok meg parancsaimat, én meg majd kérem az Atyát, és más vigasztalót ad nektek És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop of Hippo.
!74th and 75th Tracts on John.
By these words of the Lord " I will pray the Father, and He shall give you~
another Comforter" He doth imply that Himself is a Com- forter. The Greek word~
used, namely " Parakletos," signifieth also an Advocate, and is used in that~
sense where it is written "We have an Advocate Parakleton with the Father,~
Jesus Christ the Righteous." "Even the Spirit of truth, Whom the world cannot~
receive," "because,": as we read elsewhere "the carnal mind is enmity against;~
God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be" as we~
may say plainly nothing can make unrighteousness righteous. By "the world," in~
this place, we must understand the lovers of the world, a love which cometh not~
of the Father. And therefore it is that this love of the world, which we strive~
to lessen and to destroy in ourselves, is contrary to " the love of God, which~
is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us."

[Lectio8]
"The Spirit of truth; Whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth Him not,~
neither knoweth Him " for to love the world is to lack those spiritual eyes,~
which are able to see Him Who is invisible, the Holy Ghost. " But ye know Him,"~
saith the Lord to His disciples, " for He shall dwell with you, and shall be in~
you." He will be in them to dwell in them, not dwell in them to be in them for~
one must first be in a place before one dwell there. But lest the Apostles~
should think that the words, "He shall dwell with you," signified that He should~
visibly abide with them for a while, as do guests in the houses of men, the Lord~
saith in explanation "He shall be in you."
_
@Tempora/Pasc6-0:Responsory8

[Lectio9]
Therefore is He seen That is invisible. If He were not in us we could have in us~
no knowledge of Him but He is seen in us, as we see our conscience. We see the~
faces of other men, but we cannot see our Own but of consciences we see none~
save that within ourselves. But our conscience is never elsewhere but within us~
whereas the Holy Ghost may be without us, as well as within us. He is given to~
be within us, and, unless He be within us, we can neither see nor know Him,~
either within or without us. Then, after that He had promised the Holy Ghost,~
the Lord, lest they should deem that He was to give them that other Comforter~
instead of Himself, and that He Himself was to be no longer with them, said also "I~
will not leave you orphans I will come to you." Therefore, although the Son of~
God hath made us by adoption sons of His Own Father, and hath willed that the~
Same Who is His Father by nature should be our Father by grace, nevertheless, He~
showeth that Himself hath toward us a love as of a Father, where He saith "I~
will not leave you orphans."
