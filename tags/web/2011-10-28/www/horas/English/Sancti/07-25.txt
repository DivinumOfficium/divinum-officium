[Oratio]
Thou thyself, O Lord, the Sanctifier and the Shepherd of thy people, that we who~
are overshadowed by the help of thine Apostle James may, in our conversation,~
walk with thee, and in all quietness of spirit serve thee.
$Per Dominum

[Lectio4]
James, the Son of Zebedee and brother of the Apostle John, was a Galilean, and~
with his brother one of the first of His Apostles whom the Lord called, whileas~
they were in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets and they~
immediately left the ship, and their father, and followed Him. (Matth. iv. 21,~
22.) And He surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder. (Mark iii.~
17.) Peter, and James, and John, were the three Apostles whom the Saviour loved~
best; them He took and brought up into an high mountain apart, and was~
transfigured before them, (Matth. xvii. 1,2;) when He went to the house of the~
ruler of the synagogue to raise his daughter from the dead, He suffered no man~
to follow Him save Peter, and James, and John, (Mark v. 37;) and, at the last,~
just before the Jews took Him, when He cometh unto a place called Gethsemane,~
and saith unto the disciples Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.. He~
took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee. (Matth. xxvi. 36, 37.)

[Lectio5]
After that Jesus Christ was ascended into heaven, James preached how that He was~
God, and led many in Judaea and Samaria to the Christian Faith. A while~
afterward, he went to Spain, and there he brought some to Christ, of whom seven~
were afterwards ordained Bishops by Blessed Peter, and were the first such sent~
into that country. From Spain James went back to Jerusalem, where he taught the~
Faith to divers persons, and, among others, to the Magian Hermogenes. Thereupon~
Herod Agrippa, who had been raised to the kingdom under the Emperor Claudius, to~
curry favour with the Jews, condemned James to death for his firm confession~
that Jesus Christ is God. The officer who led James to the judgmentseat, at~
sight of the courage wherewith he was ready to offer up his testimony, declared~
himself also to be a Christian.

[Lectio6]
As they were being hurried to execution, this man asked pardon of James, and the~
Apostle kissed him, saying, Peace be unto thee. James healed a paralytic, and~
immediately afterwards both the prisoners were beheaded. The body of the Apostle~
was afterwards taken to Compostella, (in the province of Gallicia, in Spain,)~
where his grave is very famous. Multitudes of pilgrims from all parts of the~
earth betake themselves thither to pray, out of sheer piety or in fulfilment of~
vows. The Birth - day of James is kept by the Church upon this day, which is~
that of the bringing of his body to Compostella. It was about Easter-time (Acts~
xii. 2-4) that he bore witness to Jesus Christ with his blood, at Jerusalem,~
being the first of the Apostles to do so.

From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 20:20-25
At that time Came to Jesus the mother of Zebedee's children, with her sons,~
worshipping Him, and desiring a certain thing of Him. And so on.
_
Homily by St John Chrysostom, (Patriarch of Constantinople.)
!66th on Matth.
Let no man be troubled if we say that the Apostles were still imperfect, for the~
mystery of the Cross was not yet finished, the grace of the Spirit had not yet~
been shed abroad in their hearts. If thou wilt behold them in their strength,~
consider them such as they became after the grace of the Spirit was given them,~
and thou wilt perceive that they had trodden under foot every vain desire. This~
is the cause wherefore their present imperfection is made known unto us, that is,~
that thou mayest see how great a change could be forthwith wrought by grace. But~
nevertheless let us now look how they came unto Christ, and what they said.~
Master, they said, we would that Thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall~
desire. (Mark x. 35.) And He said unto them What would ye that I should do for~
you? (Mark X. 36.) not, surely, that He knew not what their wish was, but that He would~
make them answer, and so uncover the wound, to lay a plaster upon it.

[Lectio8]
Their wish proceeded from earthly motives, and they were shy and ashamed to~
express it, and therefore they took Christ apart, and so asked Him. The~
Evangelist saith, For they were gone apart, that they might not be discovered of~
them and then they told Him what they sought. To me it seemeth most likely~
that they had heard how that the disciples should sit upon twelve thrones; they~
were fain to obtain for themselves the chiefest places at this enthronement;~
they knew that the Lord loved them better than the most of the others; but they~
feared that Peter would still be preferred before them; and therefore they made~
bold to say Grant unto us that we may sit, one at thy right Hand, and the~
other at thy left Hand, in thy glory. (Mark x. 37.) They were even instant with~
Him, saying: Say.. that we may.. And what answered He? To show that they were~
asking no spiritual gift, nor even knew for themselves what they were asking,~
nor would have asked it if they had known what it was, Jesus said unto them~
Ye know not what ye ask  ye know not how great a thing, how wonderful a thing~
this is, a thing which even is not Mine to give.

[Lectio9]
And He said moreover: Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and~
to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? Behold how He turneth~
their thoughts at once another way, speaking to them of things altogether~
different, as though He said, Ye come unto Me treating of honours and crowns,~
but I speak unto you of the wrestling and the sweat. This is not yet the time of~
reward, neither is My glory immediately to be revealed; but now death and danger~
are present with you. But consider how, by the manner of His questioning, He~
doth both exhort and invite them. He saith not Are ye able to bear death? Are~
ye able to shed your blood? but How are ye able to drink the cup whereto He~
presently inviteth them, saying: the cup that I shall drink of; that He may make~
them readier for the strife by knowing that it is a strife which they are to~
share with Him.
