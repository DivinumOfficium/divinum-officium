[Lectio]
Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Jews
!Heb 7:23-27
Brethren: The priests were numerous, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office; but Jesus, because he continues forever, has an everlasting priesthood. Therefore He is able at all times to save those who come to God through Him, since He lives always to make intercession for them. For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, set apart from sinners, and become higher than the heavens. He does not need to offer sacrifices daily - as the other priests did - first for His own sins, and then for the sins of the people; for this latter He did once for all in offering up Himself, Jesus Christ our Lord.

[Graduale]
!Ps 131:16-17
Her priests I will clothe salvation, and her faithful ones shall shout merrily~
for joy.
V. In her will I make a horn to sprout forth for David; I will place a lamp for~
My anointed. Alleluia, alleluia.
!Ps 109:4
The Lord has sworn, and He will not repent: You are a priest forever, according~
to the order of Melchisedec. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 10:1-9
At that time, the Lord appointed seventy-two others, and sent them forth two by~
two before Him into every town and place where He Himself was about to come. And~
He said to them, The harvest indeed is great, but the laborers are few. Pray~
therefore the Lord of the harvest to send forth laborers into His harvest. Go.~
Behold, I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves. Carry neither purse,~
nor wallet, nor sandals, and greet no one on the way. Whatever house you enter,~
first say, ‘Peace to this house!’ And if a son of peace be there, your peace~
will rest upon him; but if not, it will return to you. And remain in the same~
house, eating and drinking what they have; for the laborer deserves his wages.~
Do not go from house to house. And whatever town you enter, and they receive you,~
eat what is set before you, and cure the sick who are there, and say to them,~
‘The kingdom of God is at hand for you.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 67:36
God is wonderful in His Saints; the God of Israel is He Who gives power and~
strength to His people. Blessed be God!

[Secreta]
Look with favor, O Lord, upon the prayers and offerings of Your faithful, that~
they may be pleasing to You for the feast of Your Saints and may bring us the~
help of Your mercy.

!Matt 10:27
What I tell in you darkness, speak it in the light, says the Lord; and what you~
hear whispered, preach it on the housetops.

[Postcommunio]
We beseech You, almighty God, Who mercifully dost bestow upon us these heavenly~
gifts, grant that we may despise all earthly things through the intercession of~
Your Saints, Cyril and Methodius.
