O God, You Who, as an example of Your love, divinely taught St. Peter to enrich~

the faithful, grant by his intercession, that we may be released from the~
slavery of sin and rejoice in lasting freedom in heaven.

Lesson from the first letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians
!1 Cor. 4:9-14
Brethren: We have been made a spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men. We are fools for Christ, but you are wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are honored, but we are without honor! To this very hour we hunger and thirst, and we are naked and buffeted, and have no fixed abode. And we toil, working with our own hands. We are reviled and we bless, we are persecuted and we bear with it, we are maligned and we entreat, we have become as the refuse of this world, the offscouring of all, even until now! I write these things not to put you to shame, but to admonish you as my dearest children, in Christ Jesus our Lord.

!Ps 36:30-31

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 12:32-34
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples, Do not be afraid, little flock, for~
it has pleased your Father to give you the kingdom. Sell what you have and give~
alms. Make for yourselves purses that do not grow old, a treasure unfailing in~
heaven, where neither thief draws near nor moth destroys. For where your~
treasure is, there also will your heart be.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 20:2-3
O Lord, in Your strength the just man is glad; in Your victory how greatly he~
rejoices! You have granted him his heart’s desire.
