swift course, thine Almighty Word, O Lord, leapt down out of thy Royal Throne.

O Almighty and everlasting God, do Thou order all our actions in conformity with~

[Lectio4]
From the Sermons of Pope St Leo (the Great.)
!9th on Christmas.
Dearly beloved brethren, the greatness of God's work, in its breadth and height,~
passeth the power of man's utterance; and, therefore, when we must needs not~
keep silence, we find it hard to know what to say. The words of the ProphetWho~
shall declare His generation? (Isa. liii. 8) look not only to the Divine, but~
also to the human birth of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Faith believeth, but~
words cannot explain, how the two natures were joined in one Person, and therein~
we find that we shall never lack matter of praise in Him, Whose abundance ever~
outrunneth the power of our expression.

[Responsory4]
@Sancti/12-25:Responsory5

[Lectio5]
Therefore let us rejoice, that this mystery of mercy is greater than we can ever~
speak; and let us feel that it is good for us to fail if we try to express the~
height and depth of redeeming love. He cometh nearest to the knowledge of the~
truth, who, the farther he advanceth, seeth all the more clearly that he can~
never overtake that whereafter he searcheth. For he that imagineth therein that~
he hath ever attained unto the goal, hath not found that which he seeketh, but~
hath altogether missed.

[Responsory5]
@Sancti/12-25:Responsory6

[Lectio6]
But lest we should be confounded at the weakness of our mortality, we have help~
in the words of the Prophets and Evangelists; and they are able so to inflame~
and teach us that we may see the Birth of the Lord, wherein the Word was made~
Flesh, not so much as a thing past, as a thing present. The proclamation of the~
angel to the shepherds who watched their flocks by night, ringeth in our ears~
also; and for this end are we appointed to rule the Lord's flock, that we may~
ever keep in our heart the word revealed from heaven, and say unto you, as we do~
this day Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all~
people; for unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, Which is~
Christ the Lord!

[Lectio7]
From the holy Gospel according to Luke.
!Luke 2:33-40
In that time his father and mother were wondering at those things which were~
spoken concerning him. And so on.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!Bk. ii. on Luke ii.
We see that God's abounding grace is poured forth on all by the birth of the~
Lord, and that the gift of prophecy is not denied to the righteous, but to the~
unbelieving. Simeon prophesieth that our Lord Jesus Christ is set for the fall~
and rising again of many in Israel, setting forth that the just and the unjust~
reap different fruits from the coming of the Saviour; so will it be with us;~
according to our individual works will the True and Just Judge apportion to us~
punishment or reward.

[Responsory7]
@Sancti/12-25:Responsory7

[Lectio8]
See, a sword shall pierce through thine own soul also. We have no record or~
tradition that Mary left this world by suffering a violent death, and the~
material sword can pierce the body only, and not the soul. Wherefore here we see~
the wisdom of Mary in that she was not ignorant of the heavenly mysteries. For,~
the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword,~
piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and~
marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart for all~
things are naked and opened unto the eyes of the Son of God, from Whom also~
the secret things of our conscience are not hidden.

[Responsory8]
R. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, 
* And we saw his glory, the glory as it were of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.
V. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
R. And we saw his glory, the glory as it were of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.

[Lectio9]
There had been a triple prophecy; the prophecy of Simeon had followed the~
prophecy of the virgin, and the prophecy of the wife; those, namely, of Mary and~
Elizabeth. And now ought the widow also to prophesy, that no sex nor state might~
be wanting. And Anna is brought before us with such a title from her widowhood~
and her life, that we may well believe that she received the grace to announce~
the Advent of the Redeemer. In our exhortation addressed to widows we have~
already treated of her gifts at length, and, as we have much matter before us,~
we will not now again enter on the subject.

[Responsory9]
R. How is the King of heaven attended? He that containeth the world is laid in a~
stable
* Lying in a manger, reigning in heaven.
V. Unto us is born, this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, Which is Christ~
the Lord.
R. Lying in a manger, reigning in heaven.
&Gloria
R. Lying in a manger, reigning in heaven.

!Gal 4:4-5
v. But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent his Son, made of a woman,~

might receive the adoption of sons.

v. Therefore now he is not a servant, but a son. And if a son, an heir also~
through God.

And Jesus advanced in wisdom * and age, and grace with God and men.

v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 2:33-40
2:33 And his father and mother were wondering at those things which were spoken concerning him.
2:34 And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother: Behold this child is set for the fall, and for the resurrection of many in Israel, and for a sign which shall be contradicted;
2:35 And thy own soul a sword shall pierce, that, out of many hearts, thoughts may be revealed.
2:36 And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser; she was far advanced in years, and had lived with her husband seven years from her virginity.
2:37 And she was a widow until fourscore and four years; who departed not from the temple, by fastings and prayers serving night and day.
2:38 Now she, at the same hour, coming in, confessed to the Lord; and spoke of him to all that looked for the redemption of Israel.
2:39 And after they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their city Nazareth.
2:40 And the child grew, and waxed strong, full of wisdom; and the grace of God was in him.
