04-10# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 57: Concerning Artificers In the Monastery
_
Let artificers, if there are any in the monastery, with all humility work at their arts, if the abbot shall have given permission. But if any one of their number is puffed up by reason of his knowledge of his art, in that he seems to confer some favour upon the monastery, let such an one as this be removed from exercising that art and not engage in it anew unless by chance the abbot again order him to do so when he has become humble. And if any of the artificers’ work is to be sold, let those who are to effect the transaction see to it that they presume not to bring about any fraudulent act. Let them be mindful always of Ananias and Sapphira, lest haply the death which they incurred in the body they themselves and indeed all who shall have committed any fraud in regard to monastic property should suffer in the soul. And let not the evil of avarice creep in in the matter of the prices charged for the goods; but let them always be sold somewhat more cheaply than they can be sold by others who are seculars, that in all things God may be glorified.
