Szent Jakab Apostol levelének kezdete
!Jas 1:1-6
1 Jakab, Istennek és Urunknak, Jézus Krisztusnak szolgája üdvözletet (küld) a~
szórványokban élő tizenkét törzsnek.
2 Testvéreim, tartsátok nagy örömnek, ha különféle megpróbáltatások érnek~
benneteket.
3 Tudjátok, hogy hitetek próbájának állhatatosság a gyümölcse.
4 Az állhatatosságnak meg tökéletességre kell vezetnie, hogy tökéletesek és~
feddhetetlenek legyetek, és semmilyen tekintetben ne essetek kifogás alá.
5 Ha valaki közületek bölcsességben szenved hiányt, kérje Istentől, aki szívesen~
ad mindenkinek, anélkül, hogy a szemére vetné,
6 s meg is kapja, csak hittel kérje, egy csöppet sem kételkedve. Mert aki~
kételkedik, hasonlít a tenger hullámaihoz, amelyeket felkorbácsol és ide-oda vet a~
szél.

[Lectio2]
!Jas 1:6-11
6 s meg is kapja, csak hittel kérje, egy csöppet sem kételkedve. Mert aki~
kételkedik, hasonlít a tenger hullámaihoz, amelyeket felkorbácsol és ide-oda vet a~
szél.
7 Az ilyen ember ne higgye, hogy bármit is kap az Úrtól,
8 hiszen a lelkében megosztott ember nem tart ki semmiben sem.
9 Az alacsony rangú testvér viszont dicsekedjék felmagasztalásával,
10 a gazdag meg megalázkodásával, mert mint a rét virága, semmivé lesz.
11 Ha a nap fölkel, perzselő heve kiégeti a növényt, virága lehull, szépsége~
elenyészik. Így lesz semmivé a gazdag is a vállalkozásaival.

[Lectio3]
!Jas 1:12-16
12 Boldog az az ember, aki a kísértésben helytáll, mert miután kiállja a próbát,~
megkapja az élet koszorúját, amelyet az Úr azoknak ígért, akik őt szeretik.
13 Senki se mondja, aki kísértést szenved: "Az Isten kísért", mert az Istent nem~
lehet rosszra csábítani, és ő sem csábít rosszra senkit.
14 Minden embert a saját kívánsága vonzza és csábítja, így esik tőrbe.
15 Aztán a kívánság, ha már megfogant, bűnt szül, a bűn meg, ha elkövetik,~
halált szül.
16 Ne legyetek hát tévedésben, szeretett testvéreim.

[Lectio4]
Philip was born in the town of Bethsaida, and was one of the first of the twelve~
Apostles who were called by the Lord Christ. Then Philip findeth Nathanael, and~
saith unto him We have found Him of Whom Moses in the Law, and the Prophets,~
did write." And so he brought him to the Lord. How familiarly he was in the~
company of Christ, is manifest from that which is written " There were certain~
Greeks among them that came up to worship at the Feast the same came therefore~
to Philip, and desired him, saying: Sir, we would see Jesus." When the Lord was~
in the wilderness, and was about to feed a great multitude, "He said unto Philip~
Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat" Philip, after that he had~
received the Holy Ghost, took Scythia, by lot, as the land wherein he was to~
preach the Gospel, and brought nearly all that people to believe in Christ. At~
the last he came to Hierapolis in Phrygia, and there, for Christ's Name's sake,~
he was fastened to a cross and stoned to death. The day was the first of May.~
The Christians of Hierapolis buried his body at that place, but it was~
afterwards brought to Rome and laid in the Basilica of the Twelve Apostles,~
beside that of the blessed Apostle James.

[Lectio5]
James, surnamed the Just, the brother of our Lord Jesus Christ, was a Nazarite~
from the womb. During his whole life he never drank wine or strong drink, never~
ate meat, never shaved, and never took a bath. He was the only man who was~
allowed to go into the Holy of Holies. His raiment was always linen. So~
continually did he kneel in prayer, that the skin of his knees became horny,~
like a camel's knees. After Christ was ascended, the Apostles made James Bishop~
of Jerusalem and even the Prince of the Apostles gave special intelligence to~
him after that he was delivered from prison by an angel. When in the Council of~
Jerusalem certain questions were mooted touching the law and circumcision, James,~
following the opinion of Peter, addressed a discourse to the brethren, wherein~
he proved the call of the Gentiles, and commanded letters to be sent to such~
brethren as were absent, that they might take heed not to lay upon the Gentiles~
the yoke of the Law of Moses. It is of him that the Apostle Paul saith, writing~
to the Galatians " Other of the Apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's~
brother."

[Lectio6]
So great was James' holiness of life that men strove one with another to touch~
the hem of his garment. When he was ninety-six years old, and had most holily~
governed the Church of Jerusalem for thirty years, ever most constantly~
preaching Christ the Son of God, he laid down his life for the faith. He was~
first stoned, and afterward taken up on to a pinnacle of the Temple and cast~
down from thence. His legs were broken by the fall, and he was wellnigh dead,~
but he lifted up his hands towards heaven, and prayed to God for the salvation~
of his murderers, saying " Lord, forgive them, for they know not what they do "~
As he said this, one that stood by smote him grievously upon the head with a~
fuller's club, and he resigned his spirit to God. He testified in the seventh~
year of Nero, and was buried hard by the Temple, in the place where he had~
fallen. He wrote one of the Seven Epistles which are called Catholic.

Evangélium szent János könyvéből
!John 14:1-13
Azon időben így szólt Jézus tanítványaihoz: Ne legyen nyugtalan a szívetek!~
Higgyetek az Istenben és bennem is higgyetek! Atyám házában sok hely van És így~
tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop of Hippo.
!67th Tract on John.
It behoveth us, my brethren, to have our minds more given to God-ward, if we~
would that those words of the Holy Gospel which have just sounded in our ears,~
should become a living reality for our understandings. The Lord Jesus saith "~
Let not your heart be troubled. Ye believe in God, believe also in Me." Lest,~
being but men, their heart should be troubled by the fear of death, He~
strengtheneth them, even by the reminder that He is God. He saith " Ye believe~
in God, believe also in Me" for if ye believe in God, ye must needs believe in~
Me. And this were not so, if Christ were not God.

[Lectio8]
We believe in God, believe also in Him Who is by nature and not by robbery equal~
with God, for in that He emptied Himself, He did it not by laying aside the form~
of God, but by taking upon Him the form of a* servant. Ye fear death for this~
form of a servant, but let not your heart be troubled, the form of God will~
raise it up again." But what signifieth that which followeth " In My Father's~
house there are many mansions." Was it not that they had fear on their own~
account, and needed for themselves to hear Him say, " Let not your heart be~
troubled " Which of them trembled not when they had heard Him say to Peter,~
the lealest and boldest of them all, "The cock shall not crow this day, before~
that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest Me "

[Lectio9]
Meetly were they troubled, for that they were about to be scattered from Him,~
but when they heard Him say, "In My Father's house are many mansions," they had~
been comforted even if He had not also said, "I go to prepare a place for you,"~
for then they believed and knew, that, when all dangers and all trials were for~
ever over, they should be for ever with the Lord, with Christ and with God. Yea,~
though one man be stronger than another, though one be wiser than another,~
though one be holier than another, yet " in My Father's house are many~
mansions." That house is an house wherein none are strangers, but every man~
shall receive a mansion therein according as his work shall be.
