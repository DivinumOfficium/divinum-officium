[Ant 1]
Ye mountains of Gilboa, * let there be no dew, neither let there be rain upon you; for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil. How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan is slain upon the high places Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided.

[Versum 1]
V. Let the evening prayer ascend unto thee, O Lord.
R. And let there descend upon us thy mercy.

[Oratio]
O God, Who hast prepared for them that love thee such good things as pass man's understanding; pour into our hearts such love toward thee, that we, loving thee in all things and above all things, may obtain thy promises, which exceed all that we can desire.

Olvasmány Sámuel második könyvéből
!2 Sam 1:1-4
1 Saul halála után, az amalekiták elleni csatából hazatérve Dávid két napig Ciklagban maradt.
2 A harmadik nap egy ember érkezett Saul táborából. A ruhája meg volt szaggatva és hamu volt a fején. Amikor Dávid elé ért, a földre vetette magát és leborult előtte.
3 Dávid megkérdezte: "Honnét jössz?" "Izrael táborából menekültem" - felelte.
4 "Mi történt? - kérdezte Dávid. - Beszéld el nekem!" "A nép elmenekült a csatából - válaszolta -, s az emberek közül sokan elestek. Saul és fia, Jonatán is halott!"

[Responsory1]
R. Prepare your hearts unto the Lord, and serve Him Only
* And He will deliver you out of the hand of your enemies.
V. Return unto Him with all your hearts, and put away the strange gods from among you.
R. And He will deliver you out of the hand of your enemies.

[Lectio2]
!2 Sam 1:5-10
5 Ekkor Dávid megkérdezte a legényt, aki a hírt hozta neki: "Hogy tudtad meg, hogy Saul és fia, Jonatán is halott?"
6 A legény, aki a hírt hozta, ezt felelte: "Épp Gilboa hegyére tévedtem, s láttam, amint Saul lándzsája fölé hajolt - nyomában a kocsik és lovasok.
7 Amikor megfordult és észrevett, megszólított:
8 "Ki vagy?" "Egy amalekita" - válaszoltam.
9 Erre megparancsolta: "Gyere ide és add meg a kegyelemdöfést, mert bár kínlódom, még teljesen bennem van az élet."
10 Odamentem hát és megadtam neki a kegyelemdöfést, mert tudtam, hogy nem éli túl bukását. Aztán levettem a fejéről a koronát meg a karjáról a karperecet és elhoztam ide, uramnak."

[Responsory2]
R. God, Which heareth all, even He sent His Angel, and took me from keeping my father's sheep, and
* Anointed me with the oil of His mercy.
V. The Lord That delivered me out of the mouth of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear
R. And anointed me with the oil of His mercy.

!2 Sam 1:11-16
11 Erre Dávid fogta a ruháját, és megszaggatta. Ugyanígy az emberei is, akik vele voltak, mind.
12 Jajgattak és sírtak, és egészen estig böjtöltek Saulért és fiáért, Jonatánért, az Úr népéért és Izrael házáért, amiért elhullottak a kard élén.
13 Dávid ezután megkérdezte a legénytől, aki a hírt hozta neki: "Hova való vagy?" "Egy amalekitának, egy betelepült jövevénynek vagyok a fia" - válaszolta.
14 Erre Dávid azt mondta: "Hát nem féltél kinyújtani a kezed és megölni az Úr fölkentjét?"
15 Aztán Dávid odaszólította egyik legényét, és megparancsolta neki: "Gyere ide és szúrd le!" Az leszúrta, úgyhogy meghalt.
16 Dávid így szólt hozzá: "Véred szálljon a fejedre! Saját szád vallott ellened, hiszen ezt mondtad: Megadtam az Úr fölkentjének a kegyelemdöfést."

[Responsory3]
R. The Lord That delivered me out of the mouth of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear
* He will deliver me out of the hand of mine enemies.
V. God hath sent forth His mercy and His truth, and delivered my soul from among the lion's whelps.
R. He will deliver me out of the hand of mine enemies.
&Gloria
R. He will deliver me out of the hand of mine enemies.

From the Book of Moral (Reflections upon Job), written by Pope St Gregory the Great.
!Bk. iv. ch. 3, 4.
Thus was it that David, who rewarded no evil to them that did evil to him (Ps. vii. 5), when Saul and Jonathan had fallen in battle, cursed the mountains of Gilboa, saying Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain upon you, nor fields of offerings; for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil Why was it that Jeremiah, when he saw that his preaching was thrown away upon his hearers, cursed and said Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying,A man-child is born unto thee? (xx. 15.)

[Responsory4]
R. Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.
* Because the hand of the Lord was with him, he smote the Philistine, and took away the reproach from Israel.
V. Is not this David? Did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
R. Because the hand of the Lord was with him, he smote the Philistine, and took away the reproach from Israel.

[Lectio5]
He had the mountains of Gilboa to do with the death of Saul, that they should be condemned to have dew fall on them no more, neither rain, but should wither away, barren of the green glory of the springtime? But this word Gilboa signified bubbling fountain, and the death of Saul the Anointed of God is a type of the death of our Anointed Mediator. Thus we find in the mountains of Gilboa no unfit image of the proud hearts of the Jews, which had their spring in earthly desires, and took part in the death of the Anointed Saviour. And since among them their Anointed Monarch met His death, the dew of grace is upon them no more.

[Responsory5]
R. Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain upon you
* For there are the mighty of Israel fallen
V. All ye mountains that stand round about, the Lord look upon you but let Him pass by Gilboa
R. For there are the mighty of Israel fallen

[Lectio6]
And well is it said of them Let there be upon you no fields of offerings. The proud minds of the Hebrews bear yet no offering. Since the coming of their Redeemer, the most part of them remain still without belief in Him, and refuse to follow the promise of their ancient faith. The Holy Church hath borne for her first-born, holy unto the Lord, a multitude of the Gentiles, and will, but in the end of the world, embrace such Jews as she then shall find, and present them as the last gatherings of her harvest.

[Responsory6]
R. Thus saith the Lord I took thee out of thy father's house, and appointed thee to be ruler over My people, over Israel.
* And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, to establish thy kingdom for ever.
V. And I have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies.
R. And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, to establish thy kingdom for ever.
&Gloria
R. And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, to establish thy kingdom for ever.

Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 5:20-24
Ezért mondom nektek: ha igazságotok nem múlja felül az írástudókét és a farizeusokét, nem juttok be a mennyek országába. Hallottátok, hogy a régiek ezt a parancsot kapták: Ne ölj! Aki öl, állítsák a törvényszék elé. És így tovább
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop of Hippo.
!Bk. i. on the Lord's Sermon on the Mount, ch. 9.
Thou shalt not kill, is of the righteousness of the Pharisees; Thou shalt not be angry with thy brother without a cause, is of the righteousness of them which shall enter into the kingdom of heaven. The least therefore is: Thou shalt not kill, and whosoever shall break this commandment, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven, (v. 19.) But whosoever shall do it, and not kill, he is not therefore great, and meet for the kingdom of heaven; albeit, he hath risen a step; but he will have gotten farther, if he be not angry with his brother without a cause, which, if he do, he will be the farther off from manslaughter. Wherefore, He Which teacheth us that we are not to be angry without a cause, destroyeth not the law, Thou shalt not kill, but rather fulfilleth and increaseth it, making us not only to be free of the sin of outward killing, but also clean of anger within.

[Responsory7]
@Tempora/Pent01-3:Responsory1

[Lectio8]
On sins of this kind there are divers steps. First, there is the swelling feeling of anger. When this feeling appeareth in a man's heart, he keepeth it. Then the inward disturbance wringeth forth words of indignation, not themselves meaning aught, but showing the trouble of him who is provoked. And this is something more than anger kept covered under silence. Next, this audible outburst of indignation may contain direct and open reviling of him who hath roused it. And it cannot be doubted that this is something more than an empty cry of anger.

[Responsory8]
@Tempora/Pent01-0:Responsory8

[Lectio9]
Behold here the three degrees of guilt open respectively to the judgment, to the council, and to hellfire. In the judgment, there is still place for defence. In the council, albeit this also is in a sense a judgment, yet we may suppose this distinction from the judgment proper, that the council pronounceth sentence, not as the result of a trial whereat the accused is present, but as the result of a consultation among the judges, to what punishment he is to be sentenced of whom it is already established that he is guilty. When we get to hell-fire, there remaineth no longer any doubt about condemnation, as in the judgment, and no longer any doubt about sentence, as in the council. In hellfire the condemnation and the pain of him that is condemned are alike certain.
&teDeum

[Ant 2]
Ye have heard that it was said * by them of old time Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment.

[Versum 2]
V. The Lord reigneth; He is clothed with majesty.
R. The Lord is clothed with strength, and hath girded Himself with power.

[Ant 3]
If thou bring thy gift to the Altar, * and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee, leave there thy gift before the Altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. Alleluja.

[Versum 3]
V. Let my prayer, O Lord, be set forth.
R. As incense before thee.
