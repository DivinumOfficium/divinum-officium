[Ant 1]
Cum audisset Job * nuntiorum verba, sustinuit patienter, et ait: Si bona~
suscepimus de manu Domini, mala autem quare non sustineamus? In omnibus his non~
peccavit Job labiis suis, neque stultum aliquid contra Deum locutus est.

[Versum 1]
V. Let the evening prayer ascend unto thee, O Lord.
R. And let there descend upon us thy mercy.

Olvasmány Jób könyvéből
!Job 1:1-3
1 Volt Husz földjén egy Jób nevű férfi. Feddhetetlen, derék ember volt, félte az~
Istent és kerülte a rosszat.
2 Hét fia és három lánya született.
3 Nagy vagyona volt: hétezer juha, háromezer tevéje, ötszáz iga marhája, ötszáz~
szamara és számos cseléde. Így hatalmasabb volt napkelet valamennyi fiánál.

[Responsory1]
R. What shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive~
evil?
* The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away. As the Lord hath pleased, so hath~
it befallen. Blessed be the Name of the Lord.
V. Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither.
R. The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away. As the Lord hath pleased, so hath~
it befallen. Blessed be the Name of the Lord.

!Job 1:4-5
4 Fiai vendégséget szoktak rendezni: ki-ki a saját házában, a rá eső napon.~
Ilyenkor üzentek és három nővérüket is meghívták, hogy egyenek és igyanak ők is~
velük.
5 Valahányszor sorra lejártak a vendégség napjai, Jób elhívatta és~
megtisztította őket. Korán reggel fölkelt, és égőáldozatot mutatott be~
mindegyikükért. Így gondolkodott ugyanis: "Hátha vétkeztek gyermekeim és~
szívükben káromolták Istent." Így járt el Jób minden alkalommal.

[Responsory2]
R. My sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the~
waters, for the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I~
was afraid of is come unto me. Was not I silent Held not I my peace Was not I~
at rest
* And trouble came.
V. Behold, I cannot help myself, and they that were needful unto me have~
forsaken me.
R. And trouble came.

!Job 1:6-11
6 Egy napon az történt, hogy az Isten fiai fölkerekedtek, és az Úr elé járultak. A~
sátán is megjelent köztük.
7 Az Úr így szólt a sátánhoz: "Honnét kerülsz ide?" A sátán ezt felelte az~
Úrnak: "Szerte bebarangoltam a földet és bolyongtam rajta."
8 Akkor az Úr így szólt a sátánhoz: "Felfigyeltél-e szolgámra, Jóbra? Mert nincs~
hozzá fogható a földön: feddhetetlen, derék ember, féli az Istent és kerüli a~
rosszat."
9 A sátán azt válaszolta az Úrnak: "Talán bizony ingyen olyan istenfélő az a~
Jób?
10 Nem magad emeltél-e sövényt köré, háza és minden vagyona köré? Megáldottad~
keze munkáját, úgyhogy birtoka egyre gyarapszik a földön.
11 Csak nyújtsd ki egyszer a kezedet és nyúlj hozzá egész vagyonához! Szavamra,~
szemtől szemben fog majd káromolni!"

[Responsory3]
R. Why do ye argue against the words of truth Do ye imagine words to reprove~
me and strive to confound one that is your friend
* Nevertheless, finish that ye have in mind.
V. Judge that which is just, and ye shall find no iniquity in my tongue.
R. Nevertheless, finish that ye have in mind.
&Gloria
R. Nevertheless, finish that ye have in mind.

From the Book of Moral (Reflections upon Job) written by Pope St Gregory (the~
Great.)
!Bk. ii. ch. i.
The Holy Scripture is put before the eyes of our mind somewhat after the fashion~
of a looking-glass, that we may see therein the aspect of our inward man.~
Therein we see what are our unsightly, and what our comely traits thereby we~
judge how we are growing, and how far yet we are from fulness of stature. The~
Holy Scripture telleth of the doings of the Saints, and stirreth up the heart of~
us weaklings to follow them. While it maketh memorial of their victorious deeds,~
it strengtheneth our frailty to strive against sin. And so by the words of the~
Scripture it cometh to pass that the soul trembleth less at the battle, for that~
she seeth how many times the enemies before her have been beaten by brave men.

[Responsory4]
R. My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust. My skin is dry and drawn~
together.
* Remember me, O Lord, for my life is wind.
V. My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.
R. Remember me, Lord, for my life is wind. 

[Lectio5]
And some whiles the Scripture M showeth unto us, not only how the Saints fought~
bravely, but also how they fell, that we may see by the example of the mighty,~
not only what weapons we must take, if we would conquer, but also what snares we~
must keep clear of, if we would avoid falling. For example, here is Job on the~
one hand, waxing nobler under trial, and on the other hand, David, tried, and~
failing utterly. And so the glory of the great strengtheneth our hope, and the~
backsliding of the same doth stir us up to be watchful and lowly the one~
cheering us with gladness, and the other putting us on our guard through fear,~
so that the soul of him which heareth of these things may by the one gain sure~
and certain hope, and by the other fearfulness and watchfulness, and so neither~
be rashly puffed up, nor hopelessly cast down, nor may faint under the weight of~
dread, forasmuch as she is stirred up to trustfulness by the example of him who~
triumphed.

[Responsory5]
R. My days are few, and in a short while they will be ended. Let me alone, then, O~
Lord that I may bewail my sorrow a little
* Before I go to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death.
V. thine hands, O Lord have made me, and fashioned me together round about,~
and yet dost Thou forthwith destroy me
R. Before I go to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death.

[Lectio6]
!Bk. i. ch. 1.
There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job. We are told where this~
holy man lived, that thereby we may gauge the worth of his bravery. Who knoweth~
not that Uz is a place in the countries of the Gentiles The Gentile world~
had been so degraded and corrupted by sin, that they had ceased to know that~
they had a Maker. Therefore is it told us where Job dwelt, that it may redound~
to his praise that he was good in the midst of the wicked. It is not very~
praiseworthy to be good among the good, but to be good among the bad. For even~
as it is more grievous to be bad among the good, so is it right praiseworthy to~
have remained good among the bad.

[Responsory6]
R. Hide not thy face from me, O Lord Withdraw not thine hand far from me
* And let not thy dread make me afraid.
V. O Lord, correct me but in mercy not in thine anger, lest Thou bring me to~
nothing.
R. And let not thy dread make me afraid.
&Gloria
R. And let not thy dread make me afraid.

[Responsory7]
R. O that Thou wouldest hide me in the grave that Thou wouldest keep me secret,~
until thy wrath be past, even thine, O Lord, Thou That alone art God
* That Thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me
V. Are thy days as the days of man, that Thou inquirest after mine iniquity~
and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand.
R. That Thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!
