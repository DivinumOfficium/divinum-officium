<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>CHAPTER I GENERAL NORMS</H2>
138. The canonical Hours of the Roman Breviary are: Matins, Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers and Compline. Of these, Matins, Lauds and Vespers are called major Hours; Prime, Terce, Sext, None and Compline are called minor Hours or little Hours. For the most part, however, Compline is considered separately by the rubrics.<BR><BR>
139. The obligation of saying the Divine Office extends to all the canonical Hours of the daily cursus.<BR><BR>
140. The Divine Office is recited either in choir or in common or by one alone (a solo ). It is said in choir if it is recited by a community which has the obligation of choir under ecclesiastical laws; in common, if it is recited by a community which does not have the choir obligation.<BR><BR>
141. The following rules hold both for the recitation of the Divine Office in choir or in common (even if it is done by two or three persons only) and for the recitation by one alone, unless it is expressly mentioned that a rule applies to only one kind of recitation.<BR><BR>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=1><A HREF=#top>Top</A></FONT></P><A NAME=2>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>CHAPTER II THE TIME FOR SAYING THE CANONICAL HOURS</H2>
142. By their very makeup the canonical Hours of the Divine Office are ordained to the sanctification of the various hours of the natural day. Hence it is best, both for the real sanctification of the day and for the spiritually fruitful recitation of the Hours themselves, that each canonical Hour be recited at the time which most nearly approaches its own true time.<BR><BR>
143. That the obligation of reciting the Divine Office may be satisfied, however, it is sufficient that all the canonical Hours be said within the space of the twenty four hours of the day.<BR><BR>
144. For a good reason, Matins may be anticipated in the afternoon or evening hours of the preceding day, but not before two o'clock in the afternoon.<BR><BR>
145. Since Lauds are a morning prayer, they are said in the early morning in choir and in common; and this rule may fittingly be observed also in the recitation by one alone.<BR><BR>
146. Even in Lent and Passiontide, Vespers are said in the hours after noon in choir and in common; and this rule may fittingly be observed also in the recitation by one alone.<BR><BR>
147. For all those who are bound to the recitation of the Divine Office and especially for those living in religious communities, it is very appropriate that Compline be said as the last prayer at the end of the day, even if for some good reason Matins of the following day have already been anticipated. In this case the Pater noster otherwise said after the verse Adiutorimn nostrum is omitted, and in its place, in choir and in common, there is an examination of conscience lasting a reasonable length of time. Then the Confiteor and the rest are said in the usual way. This practice may fittingly be observed also in the recitation by one alone.<BR><BR>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=1><A HREF=#top>Top</A></FONT></P><A NAME=3>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>CHAPTER III THE CALENDAR TO BE FOLLOWED IN THE RECITATION OF THE DIVINE OFFICE</H2>
148. The Divine Office is to be recited according to a "proper" calendar or, if one is lacking, according to the calendar of the universal Church, as indicated in the following sections.<BR><BR>
149. Beneficiaries must follow the calendar of their church (No. 53 b).<BR><BR>
150. The diocesan clergy must follow the calendar of the church or oratory to which they are permanently assigned (No. 53 fo); or, if they are not permanently assigned to any church or oratory or if they are living outside of their diocese for a long time, they must follow the calendar of their diocese with the feasts of their place of residence added (No. 44), or the calendar of the place in which they are staying.<BR><BR>
151. Religious of either sex hound to choir shall observe the calendar of their house (No. 56 b); or, when they take part in choir in another house of their Order, the calendar of the house in which they are staying.<BR><BR>
152. Religious having a proper calendar but not hound to choir shall observe the calendar of their house (No. 56 b); or, if they recite the Office in common in another house of their Congregation or Institute, the calendar of the house in which they are staying.<BR><BR>
153. Religious who have no proper calendar shall observe the calendar of their church (No. 53 b), adding the proper and indult feasts (No. 46).<BR><BR>
154. In diocesan seminaries and diocesan colleges of clerics, in charge of religious, for the recitation of the Divine Office in common, whether by the clerics or by the religious saying the Office in common together with the clerics, the calendar of the place is to be observed (No. 53 a) with the feasts of the seminary or college church added (No. 45). Permission is given also to add the titular feast and the feast of the holy founder of the religious to whom the administration of the seminary has been entrusted.<BR><BR>
155. In inter-diocesan, regional, national and international seminaries and colleges of clerics, for the recitation of the Divine Office in common, the calendar of the universal Church is to be used, with the following added: feasts of a principal patron of the nation, of the region or province, whether ecclesiastical or civil, of the diocese, of the town or city; the anniversary of the dedication of the cathedral church of the diocese; other feasts actually kept as holidays, if there are any; and the feasts of the seminary or college church (No. 45). But if the administration of a seminary of this kind has been entrusted to religious, the calendar of the universal Church is to be used also by the religious who recite the Office in common together with the clerics. Permission is given, however, to add the titular feast of the Order or Congregation and the feast of the holy founder of the religious to whom the administration of the seminary has been entrusted.<BR><BR>
156. In inter-provincial, national and international colleges and houses of religious, for the recitation of the Divine Office in choir or in common, the proper calendar of the whole Order or Congregation is to be used (No. 55), with the addition only of the feasts of their own church (No. 45) and of those specified in No. 57.<BR><BR>
157. Any diocesan cleric, however, or any religious of either sex, obliged under any title to recite the Divine Office, who participates in the Office in choir or in common according to another calendar or rite than his own, is thereby satisfying his obligation as far as this part of the Office is concerned. Likewise, when anyone participates in votive Vespers of any external solemnity, he is satisfying his obligation as to this part of the Office, as long as the aforesaid Vespers have been celebrated in their entirety and according to the rubrics.<BR><BR>

<H3>L) Lessons at Matins</H3>
I The lessons in general<BR><BR>
211. At the end of each nocturn three lessons are said. Thus Offices with three nocturns have nine lessons, while those with one nocturn have three.<BR><BR>
212. The term "of the occurring Scripture" is used to designate the lessons from sacred Scripture assigned to the first nocturn or to the single nocturn and distributed in an established order throughout the individual days in the Proper of the Season.<BR><BR>
213. If any lessons from the occurring Scripture cannot be said on the day assigned, they are omitted, even if they are the beginnings of books. An exception is the beginning of the 1st Epistle to the Corinthians: if the 1st Sunday after Epiphany occurs on January 13, these lessons are read on the preceding Saturday.<BR><BR>
214. Commemorated Offices do not have a lesson in the Office of the day.<BR><BR>
215. Lessons from the Scripture lire read with the title of the sacred book from which they are taken, unless an express notation to the contrary is made. Similarly, lessons from a sermon or a treatise or a pontifical document are read with the title and the name of the author; and the author's name is prefixed to the lessons from a homily on the gospel of the day.<BR><BR>
216. At the end of each lesson is lidded: Tu autem, Domine, miserere nobis, and the response is Deo gratias. This conclusion is omitted in the Offices of the Sacred Triduum and of the dead.<BR><BR>

II Lessons in an Office of three nocturns<BR><BR>
217. The three lessons of the first nocturn are from the Scripture, and:<BR><BR>
a) in a festive and in a semifestive Office, they are either proper or specially assigned or from the Common;<BR><BR>
b) in the Offices of the Sacred Triduum, they are proper.<BR><BR>
218. The three lessons of the second nocturn are:<BR><BR>
a) in a festive and in a semifestive Office, of the life of the Saint, or from a sermon or a treatise assigned to the day, as in the Proper or in the Common; But if only one or two lessons are proper or assigned, the full number of three is made up by lessons taken from the Common.<BR><BR>
b) in the Offices of the Sacred Triduum, from the sermon assigned to the day.<BR><BR>
219. The three lessons of the third nocturn are:<BR><BR>
a) in a festive and in a semifestive Office, of the homily on the gospel of the day;<BR><BR>
h) in the Offices of the Sacred Triduum, from the Epistles of St. Paul the Apostle, as in the Proper.<BR><BR>

III Lessons  in  an   Office  of one nocturn<BR><BR>
220. In a Sunday Office, the order of the three lessons is as follows:<BR><BR>
a) The first and second lessons of the occurring Scripture are said, as in the Proper. The first lesson from sacred Scripture is that which is now given as first in the Breviary. The second, however, is formed by combining the present second and third lessons into one, the intervening responsory being omitted.<BR><BR>
b) The third lesson is the reading of the homily on the gospel of  the day. The lesson taken is that which is now given in the Breviary  as the first of the third nocturn.       <BR><BR>
221. In an ordinary Office, the order of the three lessons is as follows:	<BR><BR>
a) The first and second lessons as are said from the Scripture; and this as is ordinarily the occurring Scripture, unless there are proper or specially assigned lessons. The first lesson from sacred Scripture is that which is now given as first in the Breviary. The second, however, is formed by combining the present second and third lessons into one, the intervening responsory being omitted.<BR><BR>
b) The third lesson is of the feast, namely the proper lesson which in the past was commonly called the "abridged" (contracta) lesson. If there is no abridged lesson, the proper lessons formerly of the second nocturn are combined into one. But if the feast lacks proper lessons, the fourth lesson from the Common is taken as the third lesson.<BR><BR>
222. In a ferial Office, the order of the three lessons is as follows:<BR><BR>
a) If the Office is that of a vigil or of a feria with a homily, the three lessons of the homily on the gospel of the day are said.<BR><BR>
b) If the Office is of a feria without a homily, the three lessons of the occurring Scripture are said, I as they are given in the Breviary.     |<BR><BR>

IV Certain peculiarities concerning the lessons<BR><BR>
223. The lessons of the Office of<BR><BR>
the dead are arranged in their own way, as noted in their place.<BR><BR>
224. Throughout the octaves of Easter and Pentecost the three lessons of the homily on the day's gospel are said.<BR><BR>
225. With the coming of Septuagesima Sunday, the lessons assigned to the Sundays and ferias after Epiphany for which no place can be found are omitted altogether that year. The same holds for the lessons of the Sundays after Pentecost and of the ferias following those Sundays which are impeded with the coming of the first Sunday of August, and also for the lessons of the months of August, September, October and November which are impeded with the coming of the first Sunday of the following month or the first Sunday of Advent.<BR><BR>

<H3>M) The responsories after the lessons of Matins </H3>
I The responses in general<BR><BR>
226. A responsory is said after each lesson, except after the last when the hymn Te Deum is to be said.<BR><BR>
227. The responsories are so connected with the lessons that they are taken on the same plan as the lessons, unless the rubrics expressly provide otherwise.<BR><BR>
228. Responsories which cannot be said on their own day are not transferred, but omitted.<BR><BR>
229. In Paschaltide an Alleluia is added at the end of each responsory, before the verse, unless there is already one there; but no Alleluia is added after the verse.<BR><BR>
230. At the end of the last responsory of each nocturn, after the repetition of the last part of the responsory, the Gloria Patri is said, j and then the last part of the responsory is repeated again, unless some other arrangement is indicated at that point. In an Office of Passiontide, however, the Gloria Patri is omitted from the last responsory of each nocturn, and in its place the whole responsory is repeated from the beginning, up to but not including the verse. In the Office of the dead the Requiem aeternam is said instead of the Gloria Patri in the last responsory of each nocturn.<BR><BR>
231. Any peculiarities which may occur in the manner of saying the  responsories are indicated in their respective places.<BR><BR>

II The responsories in Offices of three nocturns<BR><BR>
232. The following plan is observed for responsories of three nocturns:<BR><BR>
a) in a festive and in a semifestive Office, they are proper or from the Common;<BR><BR>
b) in the Offices of the Sacred Triduum, they are proper.<BR><BR>

III The responsories in Offices of one nocturn<BR><BR>
233. In a Sunday Office, the order of the responsories is as follows:<BR><BR>
a) the first is the responsory which is placed after the first lesson;<BR><BR>
b) the second is the responsory which was formerly found after the third lesson. At the end of this responsory the Gloria Patri  and the | o repetition of the last part of the responsory are omitted when a third responsory is to be said;<BR><BR>
c) when a third responsory is to be said, it is the one which was formerly placed after the third lesson of the homily.<BR><BR>
234. In an ordinary Office with lessons from the occurring Scripture, in the order of the responsories is as follows:	i<BR><BR>
a) the first is the responsory which is placed after the first lesson;<BR><BR>
b) the second is the responsory which is found after the third lesson.<BR><BR>
235. In an ordinary Office with lessons from the Scripture which are proper or specially assigned, the responsories are proper or from the Common, and are said in the same order as above (No. 234).<BR><BR>
236. In a ferial Office, whether of a feria or of a vigil, the responsories of the current feria as given in the Proper of the Season are said. <BR><BR>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=1><A HREF=#top>Top</A></FONT></P><A NAME=5N>
<H3>N) The hymn Te Deum</H3>
237. The hymn Te Deum is said at Matins, after the last lesson, in place of a ninth or third responsory:<BR><BR>
a) on Low Sunday, on Pentecost Sunday, and in Matins of Easter Sunday, which is recited by those who did not take part in the Easter Vigil;<BR><BR>

239. When the Hymn Te Deum is omitted a ninth or third responsory is said in its place<BR><BR>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=1><A HREF=#top>Top</A></FONT></P><A NAME=5O>
<H3>O) The little chapters and the short lesson at Prime</H3>
240. A little chapter is said at all the Hours except Matins, after the psalms with their antiphons have been completed; at Compline, however, after the hymn. The little chapter is omitted from Lauds of | i Thursday of the Lord's Supper to None of Saturday of Easter week, and in the Office of the dead.<BR><BR>
241. The little chapter said at Prime is always Regi saeculorum, and at Compline Tu autem in nobis. At the other Hours it is taken from the Ordinary or the Psalter, from the Proper or the Common, according to the different kinds of Offices (Nos. 165-177).<BR><BR>
242. The short lesson said at Prime is always of the Season, as in the Ordinary.<BR><BR>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=1><A HREF=#top>Top</A></FONT></P><A NAME=5P>
<H3>P)   I he short responsories of the little Hours</H3>
243. Short responsories are said at the little Hours and at Compline after the little chapter. They are omitted, however, from Thursday of the Lord's Supper to None of Saturday of Easter week, and in the Office of the dead.<BR><BR>
244. At Prime, in the responsory Christe, Fili Dei vivi, the verse Qui sedes is changed in those Offices and seasons for which a proper verse is assigned; but a proper verse of a commemorated feast is never said. The short responsory of Compline is never changed. At Terce, Sext and None the short responsories are taken from the same place as the little chapters.<BR><BR>
245. How the short responsories are to be said, whether outside of Paschaltide or in Paschaltide, or in the ferial Office of Passiontide, is indicated in the Ordinary. Outside of Paschaltide, although certain feasts may call for the addition of two Alleluias at the end of the short responsory before the verse at Terce, Sext and None, this does not mean that they are to be added also at Prime and at Compline.<BR><BR>
246. A collect is said at the end of each Hour, at the place indicated in the Ordinary, except at Matins when it is recited together with Lauds.<BR><BR>
247. Before the collect, in the recitation in choir or in common, Dominus vobiscum and the response Kt cum spiritu tuo are said. In the recitation by one alone, and by those who have not been ordained deacons, Domine, exaudi orationem meam and the response Et clamor meus ad te veniat are said, unless they have just been said. Then Oremus is said, and the collect follows. Thus in the recitation by one alone, the Domine, exaudi orationem meam is always said instead of the Dominus vobiscum.<BR><BR>
248. At Prime and at Compline the collect is never changed, except in the Office of the Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed and at Prime in the Sacred Triduum. At the other Hours the collect given at Lauds is taken; on the ferias of Lent and Passiontide, however, there is a proper collect at Vespers.<BR><BR>
249. The collect of the Office of the day is always said with its own conclusion, the rule given at No. 110 a being observed. The collects belonging to commemorations, however, are concluded only after the last one; but the Oremus is said before each collect.<BR><BR>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=1><A HREF=#top>Top</A></FONT></P><A NAME=5R>
<H3>R) Commemorations</H3>
250. Commemorations are made according to the norms given in the general Rubrics Nos 106-114<BR><BR>

252. To commemorate the Office of a Sunday, of a feria and of the vigil of the Ascension, the antiphon and the verse are taken from the Proper of the Season, the Psalter or the Ordinary, and the collect from the Proper of the Season. To commemorate the octave of Christmas or the Office of Saints, antiphon, verse and collect are taken from the Proper or the Common. Finally, to commemorate a vigil of the 2nd or 3rd class, the antiphon and the verse are taken from the Psalter, and the collect j t from the Proper.<BR><BR>
253. In the making of commemorations the following points should be noted:<BR><BR>
a)  the same antiphon must never be repeated twice in the same Hour;<BR><BR>
b) the antiphon and the verse in the same commemoration must never consist of the same words.<BR><BR>
254. If in Lauds only one commemoration is to be made, and the antiphon and the verse are to be taken from the same Common from ' which they have been taken in the Office of the day, for the commemoration the antiphon and the verse are taken from 1st Vespers.<BR><BR>
255. If in Lauds two commemorations  are  to  be  made,  and  the antiphon and the verse are to be taken from the same Common:<BR><BR>
a)  for the first commemoration the antiphon and the verse are taken from Lauds;<BR><BR>
b) for the second, the antiphon and the verse are taken from 1st Vespers.<BR><BR>
256. If in Lauds two commemorations are to be made, and the antiphon and the verse are to be taken from the same Common from which they have been taken in the Office of the day:<BR><BR>

a) if the antiphon is the same in 1st and 2nd Vespers, for the second commemoration the antiphon from Lauds is taken, or, finally, the first antiphon of the third nocturn;<BR><BR>
b) the text of the antiphon may be used, in the same Hour, as the verse for the second commemoration to be taken from the same Common;<BR><BR>
c) the antiphon tinge, serve bone assigned to Lauds of the Common of a Confessor Bishop, is considered identical with the similar antiphon found at Lauds of the Common of a Confessor not a Bishop.<BR><BR>
258. Likewise, if the collect of the feast of which the Office is being said and the collect of the feast being commemorated are the same, the collect for the commemoration is changed to the second one from the same or a similar Common.<BR><BR>
259. If proper antiphons and verses cannot be used at a certain Hour for a commemoration, they are not transferred, but omitted.<BR><BR>

261. What is said here about the sign of the cross and the position of the body in the recitation of the Divine Office holds for the recitation in choir or in common. It is fitting, however, that those who recite the Divine Office alone conform to what is said about the sign of the cross.<BR><BR>
