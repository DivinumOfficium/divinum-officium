Let him distribute to the brethren the appointed allowance, without any arrogance or delay, that they be not scandalized, mindful of the divine word as to what he deserves who shall have scandalized one from among the little ones.

Let what has to be given out be given out and what has to be asked for be asked for at the suitable times, that nobody be disturbed and nobody embittered in the house of God.
