Lesson from the book of Revelations
!Apoc 11:19; 12:1, 10.
The temple of God in heaven was opened, and there was seen the ark of His covenant in His temple, and there came flashes of lightning, and peals of thunder, and an earthquake, and great hail. And a great sign appeared in heaven: a women clothed with the sun, and the moon was under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars. And I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, Now has come the salvation, and the power of the kingdom of our God; and the authority of His Christ.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 1:26 - 31.
At that time, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph, of the house of David, and the virgin’s name was Mary. And when the angel had come to her, he said, Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women. When she had heard him she was troubled at his word, and kept pondering what manner of greeting this might be. And the angel said to her, Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found grace with God. Behold, you shall conceive in your womb and shall bring forth a son; and you shall call His name Jesus.

[Offertorium]
!Luke 1:28
