Lesson from the second book of Kings
!2 Kgs 13:14-17
14 Now Eliseus was sick of the illness whereof he died: and Joas king of Israel~
went down to him, and wept before him, and said: O my father, my father, the~
chariot of Israel and the guider thereof.
15 And Eliseus said to him: Bring a bow and arrows. And when he had brought him a~
bow, and arrows,
16 He said to the king of Israel: Put thy hand upon the bow. And when he had put~
his hand, Eliseus put his hands over the king's hands,
17 And said: Open the window to the east. And when he had opened it, Eliseus~
said: Shoot an arrow. And he shot. And Eliseus said: The arrow of the Lord's~
deliverance, and the arrow of the deliverance from Syria: and thou shalt strike~
the Syrians in Aphec, till thou consume them.

18 And he said: Take the arrows. And when he had taken them, he said to him:~
Strike with an arrow upon the ground. And he struck three times and stood still.
19 And the man of God was angry with him, and said: If thou hadst smitten five~
or six or seven times, thou hadst smitten Syria even to utter destruction: but~
now three times shalt thou smite it.
20 And Eliseus died, and they buried him. And the rovers from Moab came into the~
land the same year.

21 And some that were burying a man, saw the rovers, and cast the body into the~
sepulchre of Eliseus. And when it had touched the bones of Eliseus, the man came~
to life, and stood upon his feet.
24 And Hazael king of Syria died, and Benadad his son reigned in his stead. 
25 Now Joas the son of Joachaz, took the cities out of the hand of Benadad, the son~
of Hazael, which he had taken out of the hand of Joachaz his father by war,~
three times did Joas beat him, and he restored the cities to Israel.
