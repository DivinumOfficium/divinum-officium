(Canticle of_Habacuc * Hab 3:2-33)
3:2 O Lord, I have heard thy hearing, * and was afraid.
3:3 O Lord, thy work, * in the midst of the years bring it to life:
3:4 In the midst of the years thou shalt make it known: * when thou art angry, thou wilt remember mercy.
3:5 God will come from the south, * and the holy one from mount Pharan:
3:6 His glory covered the heavens, * and the earth is full of his praise.
3:7 His brightness shall be as the light: * horns are in his hands:
3:8 There is his strength hid: * Death shall go before his face.
3:9 And the devil shall go forth before his feet. * He stood and measured the earth.
3:10 He beheld, and melted the nations: * and the ancient mountains were crushed to pieces.
3:11 The hills of the world were bowed down * by the journeys of his eternity.
3:12 I saw the tents of Ethiopia for their iniquity, * the curtains of the land of Madian shall be troubled.
3:13 Wast thou angry, O Lord, with the rivers? * or was thy wrath upon the rivers? or thy indignation in the sea?
3:14 Who will ride upon thy horses: * and thy chariots are salvation.
3:15 Thou wilt surely take up thy bow: * according to the oaths which thou hast spoken to the tribes.
3:16 Thou wilt divide the rivers of the earth. The mountains saw thee, and were grieved: * the great body of waters passed away.
3:17 The deep put forth its voice: * the deep lifted up its hands.
3:18 The sun and the moon stood still in their habitation, * in the light of thy arrows, they shall go in the brightness of thy glittering spear.
3:19 In thy anger thou wilt tread the earth under foot: * in thy wrath thou wilt astonish the nations.
3:20 Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people: * for salvation with thy Christ.
3:21 Thou struckest the head of the house of the wicked: * thou hast laid bare his foundation even to the neck.
3:22 Thou hast cursed his sceptres, the head of his warriors, * them that came out as a whirlwind to scatter me.
3:23 Their joy * was like that of him that devoureth the poor man in secret.
3:24 Thou madest a way in the sea for thy horses, * in the mud of many waters.
3:25 I have heard and my bowels were troubled: * my lips trembled at the voice.
3:26 Let rottenness enter into my bones, * and swarm under me.
3:27 That I may rest in the day of tribulation: * that I may go up to our people that are girded.
3:28 For the fig tree shall not blossom: * and there shall be no spring in the vines.
3:29 The labour of the olive tree shall fail: * and the fields shall yield no food:
3:30 The flock shall be cut off from the fold, * and there shall be no herd in the stalls.
3:31 But I will rejoice in the Lord: * and I will joy in God my Jesus.
3:32 The Lord God is my strength: * and he will make my feet like the feet of harts:
3:33 And he the conqueror will lead me upon my high places * singing psalms.
