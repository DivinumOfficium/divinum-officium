(Canticle of_Jeremias * Jer 31:10-18)
31:10 Hear the word of the Lord, O ye nations, * and declare it in the islands that are afar off,
31:11 And say: He that scattered Israel will gather him: * and he will keep him as the shepherd doth his flock.
31:12 For the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, * and delivered him out of the hand of one that was mightier than he.
31:13 And they shall come, and shall give praise in mount Sion: * and they shall flow together to the good things of the Lord,
31:14 For the corn, and wine, and oil, * and the increase of cattle and herds,
31:15 And their soul shall be as a watered garden, * and they shall be hungry no more.
31:16 Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, * the young men and old men together:
31:17 And I will turn their mourning into joy, * and will comfort them, and make them joyful after their sorrow.
31:18 And I will fill the soul of the priests with fatness: * and my people shall be filled with my good things.
