42:1 Judge me, O God, and distinguish my cause from the nation that is not holy: * deliver me from the unjust and deceitful man.
42:2 For thou art God my strength: * why hast thou cast me off? and why do I go sorrowful whilst the enemy afflicteth me?
42:3 Send forth thy light and thy truth: * they have conducted me, and brought me unto thy holy hill, and into thy tabernacles.
42:4 And I will go in to the altar of God: * to God who giveth joy to my youth.
42:5 To thee, O God my God, I will give praise upon the harp: * why art thou sad, O my soul? and why dost thou disquiet me?
42:6 Hope in God, for I will still give praise to him: * the salvation of my countenance, and my God.
