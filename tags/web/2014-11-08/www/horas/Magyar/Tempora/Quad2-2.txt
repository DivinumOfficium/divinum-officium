Evangélium szent Máté könyvéből
!Matt 23:1-12
Azon időben mondá Jézus a to:megnek e's tanítványainak: Az írástudók és a farizeusok Mózes tanítói székében ülnek. Tegyetek meg és tartsatok meg ezért mindent, amit mondanak nektek, de tetteikben ne kövessétek őket És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Bk. iv. Comm. on Matth. xxiii.
Was there ever man g-entler and kinder than the Lord? The Pharisees tempted Him;~
their craft was confounded, and, in the words of the Psalmist, The arrows of~
babes have pierced them, (Ps. lxiii. 8,) and nevertheless, because of the~
dignity of their priesthood and name, He exhorteth the people to be subject to~
them, by doing according to their words, though not according to their works. By~
the words Moses' seat we are to understand the teaching of the law. Thus also~
must we mystically take, Sitteth in the seat of the scornful, (Ps. i. 1,) and~
likewise, overthrew the seats of them that sold doves, (Matth. xxi. 12,) to~
describe doctrine.

[Lectio2]
How they bind heavy burdens, and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's~
shoulders, but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.~
This is generally directed against all teachers who command things hard, and~
themselves do not even things easy. But it is to be remarked that the shoulders,~
the fingers, and the binding of the burdens, have a spiritual interpretation.~
But all their works they do for to be seen of men. Whosoever therefore doth~
anything for to be seen of men, the same is, so far, a Scribe and a Pharisee.

[Lectio3]
They make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments.~
And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,~
and greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi. Woe to us~
miserable sinners who have inherited the vices of the Pharisees! When the Lord~
had given the commandments of the law to Moses He added afterwards Thou shalt~
bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between~
thine eyes, (Deut. vi. 8.) The sense of these words is My Law shall be in~
thine hand to order whatsoever thou doest, and ever before thine eyes that thou~
mayest meditate therein day and night. But the Pharisees, by a bad~
interpretation, were accustomed to write on pieces of parchment the Decalogue of~
Moses, that is, the Ten Words of the Law, and to tie these pieces of parchment,~
plaited in a peculiar manner, on their foreheads, so as to make a sort of crown~
round their heads, which projected in front of their eyes, and always moved~
before them.
