76:1 I cried to the Lord with my voice; * to God with my voice, and he gave ear to me.
76:2 In the day of my trouble I sought God, with my hands lifted up to him in the night, * and I was not deceived.
76:3 My soul refused to be comforted: * I remembered God, and was delighted, and was exercised, and my spirit swooned away.
76:4 My eyes prevented the watches: * I was troubled, and I spoke not.
76:5 I thought upon the days of old: * and I had in my mind the eternal years.
76:6 And I meditated in the night with my own heart: * and I was exercised and I swept my spirit.
76:7 Will God then cast off for ever? * or will he never be more favourable again?
76:8 Or will he cut off his mercy for ever, * from generation to generation?
76:9 Or will God forget to shew mercy? * or will he in his anger shut up his mercies?
76:10 And I said, Now have I begun: * this is the change of the right hand of the most High.
76:11 I remembered the works of the Lord: * for I will be mindful of thy wonders from the beginning.
76:12 And I will meditate on all thy works: * and will be employed in thy inventions.
76:14 Thy way, O God, is in the holy place: who is the great God like our God? * Thou art the God that dost wonders.
76:15 Thou hast made thy power known among the nations: * with thy arm thou hast redeemed thy people the children of Jacob and of Joseph.
76:16 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee: * and they were afraid, and the depths were troubled.
76:17 Great was the noise of the waters: * the clouds sent out a sound.
76:18 For thy arrows pass: * the voice of thy thunder in a wheel.
76:19 Thy lightnings enlightened the world: * the earth shook and trembled.
76:20 Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in many waters: * and thy footsteps shall not be known.
76:21 Thou hast conducted thy people like sheep, * by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
