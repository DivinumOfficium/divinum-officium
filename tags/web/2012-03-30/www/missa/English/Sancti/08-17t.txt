[Lectio]
Lesson from the second letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians
!2 Cor 9:6-10
v. Now this I say: He who soweth sparingly, shall also reap sparingly: and he who soweth in blessings, shall also reap blessings. Every one as he hath determined in his heart, not with sadness, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver. And God is able to make all grace abound in you; that ye always, having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work, As it is written: He hath dispersed abroad, he hath given to the poor: his justice remaineth for ever. And he that ministereth seed to the sower, will both give you bread to eat, and will multiply your seed, and increase the growth of the fruits of your justice:

[Graduale]
!Ps 8:6-7
v. Thou hast made him a little less than the angels, thou hast crowned him with~
glory and honour: and hast set him over the works of thy hands.
V. The Levite Lawrence wrought a good work, who by the sign of the Cross, gave~
sight to the blind. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 12:24-26
v. Amen, amen I say to you, unless the grain of wheat falling into the ground~
die, Itself remaineth alone. But if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. He~
that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world,~
keepeth it unto life eternal. If any man minister to me, let him follow me; and~
where I am, there also shall my minister be. If any man minister to me, him will~
my Father honour.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 20:2-3

rejoice exceedingly. Thou hast given him his heart's desire.
