From the letter of St Paul to the Ephesians
!Eph  5:1-4
1 Be ye therefore followers of God, as most dear children;
2 And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath delivered himself for us, an oblation and a sacrifice to God for an odour of sweetness.
3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not so much as be named among you, as becometh saints:
4 Or obscenity, or foolish talking, or scurrility, which is to no purpose; but rather giving of thanks.

[Lectio2]
!Eph 5:5-8
5 For know you this and understand, that no fornicator, or unclean, or covetous person (which is a serving of idols), hath inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
6 Let no man deceive you with vain words. For because of these things cometh the anger of God upon the children of unbelief.
7 Be ye not therefore partakers with them.
8 For you were heretofore darkness, but now light in the Lord. Walk then as children of the light.

[Lectio3]
!Eph 5:9-14
9 For the fruit of the light is in all goodness, and justice, and truth;
10 Proving what is well pleasing to God:
11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.
12 For the things that are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of.
13 But all things that are reproved, are made manifest by the light; for all that is made manifest is light.
14 Wherefore he saith: Rise thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead: and Christ shall enlighten thee.
