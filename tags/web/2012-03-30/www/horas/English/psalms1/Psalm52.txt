52:1 The fool said in his heart: * There is no God.
52:2 They are corrupted, and become abominable in iniquities: * there is none that doth good.
52:3 God looked down from heaven on the children of men: * to see if there were any that did understand, or did seek God.
52:4 All have gone aside, they are become unprofitable together, * there is none that doth good, no not one.
52:5 Shall not all the workers of iniquity know, * who eat up my people as they eat bread?
52:6 They have not called upon God: * there have they trembled for fear, where there was no fear.
52:7 For God hath scattered the bones of them that please men: * they have been confounded, because God hath despised them.
52:8 Who will give out of Sion the salvation of Israel? * when God shall bring back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
