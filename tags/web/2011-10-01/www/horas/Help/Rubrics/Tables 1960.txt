NOTES ON THE TABLES OF OCCURRENCE AND CONCURRENCE
1. A 1st or 2nd class feast of the Lord occurring on a Sunday takes the place of that Sunday 
with all rights and privileges; hence there is no commemoration of the Sunday.
2. If two feasts of the same divine Person or two feasts of the same Saint or Blessed
occur together, the Office is of the feast holding the higher place in the table
of precedence, and the other is omitted.
3. If a 1st or 2nd class feast of the Lord concurs with any Sunday, or vice versa, 
the Vespers are or­dered according to the table of con­currence, but there is never 
a commemoration of the concurring Sunday in the Vespers of the feast of the Lord, nor vice versa.
