[Oratio]
O God, Whose will it hath been to use blessed Angela as a mean whereby to make a new fellowship of virgins to grow and flourish in Thy Church, grant unto us, at her prayers, so angelically to live, that we may freely lay aside all earthly things, and worthily enter upon the enjoyment of those things which are eternal

[Lectio4]
Angela Merici was born of godly parents at Decenzano on the western shore of the~
Lake of Garda, in the diocese of Verona and territory of Venice, (on the 21st~
day of March, about the year of grace 1474.) From her earliest years she~
carefully guarded the lily of her virginity, with the intention of keeping it~
for ever unbroken. She had no taste for women's finery, and purposely marred the~
exceeding comeliness of her body and her sightly hair, as seeking to appear~
beautiful only in the eyes of Him Who is the Lover of souls. At ten years of age~
she lost both her father and mother, and thereafter, being fain to take upon her a~
life of greater hardness, she essayed to retire into a desert place apart, but~
this her uncle forbade her to do, and she learnt how to practise at home what~
she was not allowed to attempt in the wilderness. She often used hair-cloth and~
scourging never ate flesh -meat, except when she was sick drank wine only on~
the Feast-days of Christmas and Easter; and many a day took nothing at all. She~
was instant in prayer. What little sleep she took, she took lying on the ground.~
The devil strove to beguile her, appearing under the form of an angel of light,~
but she quickly detected him and put him to flight. At length she added to the~
glory of virginity that poverty which is commended in the Gospel she gave up~
all that she had, and adopted the dress and rule of the Third Order of St~
Francis.

[Lectio5]
She left undone no service of kindness which she was able to do to her~
neighbours. If there remained anything over of the food which was given in alms~
to herself, she gave that to the poor. She cheerfully waited upon the sick. She~
journeyed about, with a great reputation for holiness, comforting the afflicted,~
asking forgiveness for the guilty, reconciling the angry, and recalling the~
wicked from evil. Her only hunger was for the bread of Angels, and she took the~
Same right often, and then arose in her vehemence of love bearing her towards~
God, which oftentimes made her beside herself. She made a pilgrimage, with~
intense feeling, to the Holy Places in Palestine, during which journey she lost~
her sight at Canea in Crete on her way out, and recovered it at the same place~
on her way home. In this journey also, God saved her from being made prisoner by~
the unbelievers and from shipwreck. She went to Rome, (in 1525,) at once to pray~
at the immovable Rock of the Church, and to gain the abundant pardons of the~
Jubilee. Pope Clement VII. conversed with her, was edified by her holiness, and~
highly commended her neither would he let her leave Rome, until he knew that~
God was calling her elsewhere.

She went back to Brescia, and there hired an house near the Church of St Afra,~
in which house, in obedience to a vision and command from heaven, she founded a~
new Order of religious women, constituted under certain rules and holy~
regulations of life. This Order she put under the name and patronage of St~
Ursula, the fearless leader of maidens. When Angela was near to death, she~
foretold that this Order will never cease. She was well-nigh three score and ten~
years of age, and full of good works, when, in the (night between the) 27th (and~
the 28th days) of January, in the year 1540, she winged her flight heavenward.~
Her dead body lay unburied thirty days, supple and life-like. It was laid at~
last in the Church of St Afra, where sleep so many more of God's holy children.~
Divers miracles forthwith began to be worked at her grave. The fame of these~
being noised about, she began to be commonly called Blessed, and that not only~
at Brescia and Decenzano and pictures of her were put over Altars. Not many~
years afterward, holy Charles Borromeo said openly at Brescia, that she was one~
whose name the Apostolic See might well enroll among those of holy virgins. The~
reverence which had of a long time been shown to her memory was approved by the~
local Ordinaries, confirmed by divers Papal Indults, and solemnly ratified and~
established by decree of Pope Clement XIII. As she continued famous for new and~
proved miracles, Pope Pius VII., at the solemn canonization held in the Vatican~
Basilica, upon the 24th day of May, in the year 1807, added her name to the list~
of holy maids.

Mary Magdalene was born of the famous family of the Pazzi in Florence, and almost from her cradle entered on the way of perfection. At ten years old, she made a vow of perpetual virginity, and when she had taken the habit in the monastery of the Carmelite sisters, she shewed herself to be exemplary in all virtues. She was so chaste that she did not even know of anything that could harm purity. She burned with such a fire of divine love that she was unable to bear it, and had to cool her breast by pouring water over it. She was notable for her love of neighbour, often passing sleepless nights either in doing the work of the sisters, or in serving the sick, whose ulcers she sometimes cured by licking them. She frequently repeated this saying : To suffer, not to die. At length, worn out by a long and serious illness, she went to the Bridegroom in the year 1607, having completed her forty-first year. Clement IX numbered her among the Holy Virgins.
