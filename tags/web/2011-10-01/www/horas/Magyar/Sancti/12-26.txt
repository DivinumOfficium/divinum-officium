Olvasmány az Apostolok Cselekedeibõl
!Acts 6:1-6
1 Ez idõ tájt, hogy a tanítványok száma egyre nõtt, zúgolódás támadt a görögök~
közt a zsidók ellen, hogy a mindennapi alamizsnaosztáskor az õ özvegyeiket~
háttérbe szorítják.
2 Ezért a tizenkettõ összehívta a tanítványokat: "Nem volna rendjén, hogy~
elhanyagoljuk az Isten szavát, s az asztal szolgálatát lássuk el.
3 Testvérek, ezért szemeljetek ki magatok közül hét jó hírben álló, Lélekkel~
eltelt bölcs férfit. Ezeket megbízzuk a munka irányításával,
4 mi meg majd az imádságnak és az Ige szolgálatának szenteljük magunkat."
5 Tetszett a javaslat az egész közösségnek, és kiválasztották Istvánt, ezt a~
hittel és Szentlélekkel eltelt férfit, aztán Fülöpöt és Prohórust, Nikánort és~
Timont, Parmenászt és Miklóst, az antióchiai jövevényt.
6 Az apostolok elé állították õket, azok imádkoztak és rájuk tették kezüket.

!Acts 6:7-10;7:54
7 Az Úr szava terjedt, úgyhogy a tanítványok száma igen megnõtt Jeruzsálemben,~
még a papok közül is tömegesen hódoltak a hitnek.
8 István kegyelemmel és erõvel eltelve nagy csodákat és jeleket mûvelt a nép~
körében.
9 Erre a libertinusok, cireneiek, alexandriaiak, kilikiaiak és ázsiaiak~
zsinagógájából némelyek ellene támadtak,
10 és vitatkozni kezdtek Istvánnal, de bölcsességével és a Lélekkel szemben,~
amellyel beszélt, nem tudtak ellenállni.
54 Amikor ezt hallották, haragra gyulladtak, és fogukat vicsorgatták ellene.

!Acts 7:55-59
55 Õ azonban a Szentlélekkel eltelve fölnézett az égre és látta az Isten~
dicsõségét és Jézust az Isten jobbján.
56 Felkiáltott: "Látom, hogy nyitva az ég, és az Emberfia ott áll az Isten~
jobbján."
57 Erre ordítozni kezdtek, befogták fülüket, s egy akarattal rárontottak,
58 kivonszolták a városból és megkövezték. A tanúk egy Saul nevû ifjú lábához~
rakták le ruhájukat.
59 Míg kövezték Istvánt, így imádkozott: "Uram, Jézus, vedd magadhoz lelkemet!"
60 Majd térdre esett és hangosan felkiáltott: "Uram, ne ródd fel nekik bûnül!"~
Ezekkel a szavakkal elszenderült.

From the Sermons of St Fulgentius, Bishop (of Ruspa.)
!On St Stephen.
Yesterday we were celebrating the birth in time of our Eternal King; to-day we~
celebrate the victory, through suffering, of one of His soldiers. Yesterday our~
King was pleased to come forth from His royal palace of the Virgin's womb,~
clothed in a robe of flesh, to visit the world; to-day His soldier, laying aside~
the tabernacle of the body, entereth in triumph into the heavenly palaces. The~
One, preserving unchanged that glory of the Godhead which He had before the~
world was, girded Himself with the form of a servant, and entered the arena of~
this world to fight sin; the other taketh off the garments of this corruptible~
body, and entereth into the heavenly mansions, where he will reign for ever. The~
One cometh down, veiled in flesh; the other goeth up, clothed in a robe of glory,~
red with blood.

[Responsory4]
R. They stoned Stephen, calling upon God and saying
* Lord Jesus Christ, receive my spirit; and lay not this sin to their charge.
V. And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, saying
R. Lord Jesus Christ, receive my spirit; and lay not this sin to their charge.

[Lectio5]
The One cometh down amid the jubilation of angels; the other goeth up amid the~
stoning of the Jews. Yesterday the holy angels were singing, Glory to God in the~
highest; to-day there is joy among them, for they receive Stephen into their~
company. Yesterday the Lord came forth from the Virgin's womb; to-day His~
soldier is delivered from the prison of the body. Y'esterday Christ was for our~
sakes wrapped in swaddling bands; to - day He girdeth Stephen with a robe of~
immortality. Yesterday the new-born Christ lay in a narrow manger; to-day~
Stephen entereth victorious into the boundless heavens. The Lord came down alone~
that He might raise many up; our King humbled Himself that He might set His~
soldiers in high places.

[Responsory5]
R. They ran upon him with one accord, and cast him out of the city, calling upon~
God, and saying
* Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
V. And the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name~
was Saul; and they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying
R. Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.

[Lectio6]
Why brethren, it behoveth us to consider with what arms Stephen was able, amid~
all the cruelty of the Jews, to remain more than conqueror, and worthily to~
attain to so blessed a triumph. Stephen, in that struggle which brought him to~
the crown whereof his name is a prophecy, had for armour the love of God and man,~
and by it he remained victorious on all hands. The love of God strengthened him~
against the cruelty of the Jews; and the love of his neighbour made him pray~
even for his murderers. Through love he rebuked the wandering, that they might~
be corrected; through love he prayed for them that stoned him, that they might~
not be punished. By the might of his love he overcame Saul his cruel persecutor;~
and earned for a comrade in heaven, the very man who had done him to death upon~
earth.

[Responsory6]
R. The ungodly fell upon the righteous, to put him to death.
* But he received the stones with joy, that he might earn a crown of glory.
V. They stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord.
R. But he received the stones with joy, that he might earn a crown of glory.
&Gloria
R. But he received the stones with joy, that he might earn a crown of glory.

Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kõnyvébõl
!Matt 23:34-39
Azon idõben mondá Jézus az irástudóknak és farizeusoknak: Nos, prófétákat,~
bölcseket és írástudókat küldök hozzátok. Közülük némelyeket megöltök és~
keresztre feszíttek. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Book iv. Commentary on Matth. xxiii.
We have already remarked that the Lord's words, Fill ye up the measure of your~
fathers, (32,) refer in the first place to Himself, Whom the Jews afterwards put~
to death. In a secondary sense it may likewise be applied to His disciples, of~
whom He saith, Behold, I send unto you Prophets, and wise men, and Scribes. Here~
observe that, according to the Apostle writing to the Corinthians, (1 Cor. xii. 4,)~
there are diversities of gifts among Christ's followers. Some are Prophets of~
that which is to come; some are wise men, who know the due season for rebuke and~
exhortation; some are Scribes learned in the law. And of these they stoned~
Stephen, slew Paul with the sword, crucified Peter, and scourged the Disciples~
mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles. (v. 40; xvi. 23.)

[Responsory7]
R. Stephen, the servant of God, who was stoned by the Jews, saw the heavens~
opened he saw and entered in.
* Blessed is he, unto whom the heavens were opened.
V. While his poor body was crushed by the hurtling shower of stones, God's~
brightness broke upon him out of the heavenly palaces.
R. Blessed is he unto whom the heavens were opened.

[Lectio8]
It is a subject of dispute among commentators who is meant by Zacharias the son~
of Barachias. We read of several persons of the name of Zacharias. But here, in~
order to prevent any mistake, it is particularly said, Whom ye slew between the~
temple and the altar. I have read various opinions in various places upon this~
question, and I will give each. First, some hold that Zacharias the son of~
Barachias is the eleventh of the twelve Minor Prophets; and this opinion is~
supported by the father's name. But the Bible nowhere telleth us that this~
Prophet was slain between the temple and the altar; and it is hardly possible~
that he can have been, for in his time it could scarcely be said that even the~
ruins of the temple were in existence. Secondly, others maintain that this~
Zacharias was Zacharias, the father of John the Baptist. This interpretation is~
derived from the dreams of the Apocryphal Gospels, wherein it is asserted that~
he was martyred for preaching Christ's coming.

[Responsory8]
R. The gates of heaven were opened to Christ's blessed martyr Stephen, and he is~
the first of all the martyrs.
* Wherefore he reigneth crowned in heaven.
V. For he was the first to make an offering of his death to that Saviour Who~
vouchsafed to suffer death for us.
R. Wherefore he reigneth crowned in heaven.
&Gloria
R. Wherefore he reigneth crowned in heaven.

[Lectio9]
A third school will have it that this Zacharias, the son of Barachias, was that~
Zacharias of whom we read, in Chron. xxiv. 22, that he was slain by Joash,~
king of Judah, between the temple and the altar. Against this it is to be~
remarked, that that Zacharias was not the son of Barachias, but of Jehoiada the~
priest; whence it is written, Joash remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada~
his father had done to him. The question therefore ariseth, if this opinion be~
true, why, the name and manner of death both agreeing with this explanation,~
Zacharias is called the son, not of Jehoiada, but of Barachias. In Hebrew,~
Barachias signifieth the Blessed of the Lord, and Jehoiada proves his~
Righteousness. In the Gospel used by the Nazarenes the name of Jehoiada is used~
instead of Barachias.
