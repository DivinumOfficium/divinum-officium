O God, Who dost gladden us through the worthy deeds and prayers of thy blessed~
apostle Barnabas, mercifully grant that all they which seek thy mercy through~
him may effectually obtain the gift of thy grace.

[Lectio1]
From the Acts of Apostles.
!Acts 13:43-47
43 Sõt amikor a gyülekezet szétoszlott, a zsidók és az istenfélõ jövevények~
közül sokan a nyomukba szegõdtek Pálnak és Barnabásnak. Ezeket arra biztatták,~
hogy tartsanak ki az Isten kegyelmében.
44 A következõ szombaton csaknem az egész város összegyûlt, hogy hallja az Isten~
szavát.
45 Amikor a zsidók meglátták a nagy tömeget, irigység fogta el õket, s~
rágalmakat szórva próbálták Pál szavait meghazudtolni.
46 De Pál és Barnabás bátran megfeleltek nekik: "Elõször nektek kellett volna~
hirdetnünk az Isten szavát. De mert visszautasítottátok és méltatlannak~
ítéltétek magatokat az örök életre, most a pogányokhoz fordulunk.
47 Ezt a parancsot adta nekünk az Úr: A pogányok világosságává tettelek, hogy~
üdvösségük légy egészen a föld végsõ határáig."

[Lectio2]
!Acts 13:48-52
48 Amikor a pogányok ezt meghallották, örültek, és magasztalták az Isten szavát, s~
hittek is mind, akik az örök életre voltak rendelve.
49 Elterjedt az Úr szava az egész környéken.
50 A zsidók azonban felbújtották az elõkelõ vallásos asszonyokat meg a város~
tekintélyesebb férfiait, és üldözést szítva Pál és Barnabás ellen, elûzték õket a~
vidékrõl.
51 Õk lerázták - ellenük bizonyságul - lábukról a port, és Ikóniumba mentek.
52 A tanítványokat eltöltötte az öröm és a Szentlélek.

[Lectio3]
!Acts 14:1-3
1 Ikóniumban szintén a zsidók zsinagógájába mentek s ott olyan hatásosan~
beszéltek, hogy zsidók is, görögök is tömegesen fogadták el a hitet.
2 A hitetlen zsidók azonban felizgatták, és a testvérek ellen lázították a~
pogányokat.
3 De azért jó ideig ott maradtak, bátran beszéltek az Úrról, aki maga tett~
tanúságot kegyelmét hirdetõ szava mellett: megengedte, hogy kezük által csodák~
és jelek történjenek.

[Lectio4]
Joseph, who by the Apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted,~
the Son of Consolation,) a Levite and of the country of Cyprus, having land,~
sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the Apostles' feet. (Acts iv. 36,~
37.) When Paul, after his conversion, was come to Jerusalem, the disciples were~
all afraid of him, but Barnabas took him, and brought him to the Apostles, (ix.~
26, 27,) When tidings that a great number believed and turned unto the Lord at~
Antioch came unto the ears of the Church which was at Jerusalem, they sent forth~
Barnabas that he should go as far as Antioch. Who, when he came, and had seen~
the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all that with purpose of heart~
they would cleave unto the Lord. For he was a good man, and full of the Holy~
Ghost, and of faith, and much people was added unto the Lord. (xi. 21-24.)

[Lectio5]
Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus for to seek Paul, and, when he had found him,~
he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass that a whole year they~
assembled themselves with the Church, and taught much people. And the disciples~
were called Christians first in Antioch. And in these days came prophets from~
Jerusalem unto Antioch. And there stood up one of them, named Agabus, and~
signified, by the Spirit, that there should be great dearth throughout all the~
world which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar. Then the disciples,~
every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren~
which dwelt in Judea, which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the~
hands of Barnabas and Paul. (xi. 25-30.) And Barnabas and Paul returned from~
Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John,~
whose surname was Mark. (xii. 25.)

[Lectio6]
Now there were in the Church that was at Antioch, certain Prophets and teachers~
and, as Paul and Barnabas, together with them, ministered to the Lord and fasted,~
the Holy Ghost said Separate Me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I~
have called them. And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on~
them, they sent them away. So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed~
unto Seleucia and from thence they sailed to Cyprus (xiii. 1-4) in the~
which island, and in many other cities and countries, they journeyed about,~
preaching the Gospel with great gain to them that heard them. Nevertheless, at~
last, Paul and Barnabas departed asunder one from the other. And so Barnabas~
took Mark and sailed unto Cyprus, (xv. 39,) once more. And there it was that~
upon a certain nth of June, in or about the seventh year of the reign of Nero,~
Barnabas crowned the dignity of the Apostolate with the glory of martyrdom.~
During the reign of the Emperor Zeno, his body was found in its grave in Cyprus~
on his breast lay a copy of the Gospel according to Matthew, written by the hand~
of Barnabas himself.

Evangélium szent Máté könyvébõl
!Matt 10:16-22
Azon idõben így szólt Jézus tanit'tványaihoz: Úgy küldelek titeket mint~
bárányokat a farkasok közé És így tovább.
_
Homily by St John Chrysostom, Patriarch of Constantinople.
!34/A on Matthew.
When the Lord had cleared the minds of His disciples of all care, and had armed~
them by showing forth His mighty works, had estranged them from all business of~
this world, and freed them from all anxiety touching the things of time,~
moulding them into a frame of iron-like, nay, diamondlike, hardness, then at~
length He told them of the contendings against the which they were afterward to~
wrestle. By this foretelling of things to come they were much holpen. First,~
they learnt the power of His fore-knowledge. Then, they were guarded against all~
suspicion that these great sorrows flowed from faultiness in their Master. Again,~
the future sufferers were made safe from all trouble of being taken unawares.~
Lastly, seeing that they heard these things at a time nigh to His own suffering,~
they were not over troubled.

[Lectio8]
And now, that they may understand how that this is a new kind of warfare,~
and an unaccustomed manner of contending, when He sendeth them forth unarmed,~
providing neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in their purses nor scrip for~
their journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves, (x. 9, 10,)~
left to the hospitality of whosoever would receive them, He maketh not here an~
end to His discourse, but, in manifestation of His unspeakable power, He biddeth~
them, so going, to show forth the meekness of sheep, seeing they were about~
going unto wolves neither simply unto wolves, but in the very midst of wolves.~
Neither is it only the meekness of sheep which He biddeth them have, but also~
the harmlessness of doves, that He might so much the more gloriously display His~
power, when the sheep overcame the wolves. These are the sheep which albeit they~
abide in the midst of wolves, and are mangled by many a bite, not only are not~
destroyed, but do gradually make the wolves change their nature, and become~
sheep themselves.

[Lectio9]
Beyond all doubt it is a greater and more marvellous thing to change the minds~
of enemies, and to turn their thoughts round, than to kill them more~
especially when the work is to be done by only twelve sheep, and the whole world~
is full of the wolves. Shame then upon us, whose deeds are so contrary, and who~
rather run like wolves upon our enemies. For so long as we are sheep we conquer,~
yea, though a thousand wolves be gathered round about us, we overcome, and are~
the conquerors but if we become wolves ourselves, then are we conquered. For~
then doth the Shepherd's help forsake us, Who feedeth not wolves but sheep.

[Lectio94]
Barnabas the Levite, of the people of Cyprus, was sent with Paul the Apostle to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ. He sold a field he owned and brought the money from it to the Apostles. Sent to Antioch to preach, he gave new strength by his exhortations to many who had been converted to belief in Christ. Thence he set forth with St. Paul and travelled through many cities and countries, to the great benefit of his hearers. Finally he left Paul, and with John, surnamed Mark, he took ship to Cyprus. There, in the seventh year of Nero's reign, he added to the dignity of the apostolic office the crown of martyrdom.
