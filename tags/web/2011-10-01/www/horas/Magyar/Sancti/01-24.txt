[Oratio]
Mercyfully consider our weakness, O Almighty God, and whereas by the burden of~
our sins we are sore let Timothy your Martyr be mercifully pleased to deliver us~
from all things which may hurt our bodies, and from all evil thoughts which may~
defile our souls
$Per Dominum

[Lectio4]
Timothy was a native of Lystra in Lycaonia, born of a Gentile father and a~
Jewish mother. He embraced the Christian religion when the Apostle Paul came~
into those parts. The holy Apostle was so struck with the fame of Timothy's~
sanctity, that he chose him to be the companion of his journeys, and caused him~
to be circumcised, in order to remove a stumbling-block from the way of those~
Jews who felt drawn to Christianity. When they came together to Ephesus, the~
Apostle consecrated him Bishop of that Church.

[Lectio5]
Twoo of the Apostle Paul's Epistles are addressed to this Saint, of which one~
was written from Laodicea, and the other from Rome. These sacred writings so~
stirred him up to the zealous discharge of his duties as a spiritual shepherd,~
that he strove to prevent the people of Ephesus from sacrificing to Artemis on~
her feastday, knowing that sacrifice is due to God alone. The heathens thereupon~
stoned him till he was well-nigh dead, and although he was rescued by the~
Christians, and carried to a mountain near the city, he then fell asleep in the~
Lord, on the 24th day of January.

Timothy was born in Lystra in Lycaonia of a gentile father and a Jewish mother,~
and was a follower of the Christian religion when the Apostle Paul visited that~
city. Paul was so moved by what he repeatedly heard of Timothy's holiness that~
he took him with him as a companion on his journeys; yet, because of the Jews~
who had been converted to Christ and who knew that Timothy's father had been a~
Gentile, he had him circumcised. When they both arrived at Ephesus, the Apostle~
ordained him bishop to govern the Church there. The Apostle wrote him two~
letters, one from Laodicea, the other from Rome. Strengthened by these letters~
in the ministry of his pastoral office. he could not endure that the sacrifice~
which is due to God alone should be offered to the images of demons, and he~
strove to win over the people of Ephesus from the impiety of offering sacrifice~
to Diana on her feast day. He was stoned, and was nearly dead when the~
Christians rescued him and took him to a village on a neighboring mountain.~
There he died in the Lord on January 24.
