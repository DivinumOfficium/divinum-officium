O God, Who didst raise up thy blessed servant Francis to found a new Order in~
thy Church, and didst ennoble him through earnestness in prayer and love of~
penance, grant unto us after his ensample so to pray without ceasing and to~
bring our bodies into subjection, that in the end we, like him, may worthily~
attain unto thy heavenly glory.

[Lectio4]
This Francis, whose worldly name was Ascanius, was one of the noble family of~
Caracciolo. He was born in the town of Santa Mária della Villa, in the Abruzzi,~
(on the 13th day of October, in the year of grace 1563.) From his earliest~
years he showed great marks of godliness. When he was a young man he had a~
severe illness, and on his recovery determined to serve God only, and bade~
farewell to the world. He betook himself to Naples, where he was ordained Priest,~
enrolled himself in a devout guild, and gave himself up altogether to seek after~
God, and to gain souls for Him, in which work he showed himself an unwearied~
comforter to such prisoners as were condemned to death. It came to pass that~
those two great servants of God, John Austin Adorno and Fabricius Caracciolo,~
wrote a letter to a certain person, wherein they exhorted him to found a new~
religious Institute. This letter came by a mistake to be delivered to Francis~
Caracciolo. The newness of the idea and the strange ways of God's Providence~
took possession of his mind, and he joyfully added himself to their company.~
They withdrew themselves to the wilderness of the Camaldolese hermits (near~
Naples,) and there concerted the Rule of the New Order. Thence they went~
together to Rome, and obtained the confirmation of their work from Sixtus V.,~
who was pleased that they should be called The Lesser Clerks Regular, since they~
add to the three accustomed vows (of Poverty, Chastity, and Obedience,) a fourth,~
binding themselves not to seek preferment in the Church.

[Lectio5]
Ascanius Caracciolo, moved by a special love and devotion he had to the holy~
Francis of Assisi, took, when he made his solemn profession, the name of~
Francis. After two years, John Adorno departed this life, and Francis, against~
his own will, was made Head of the Order. In this office he shone a burning~
light of grace. Devoted to the prosperity of the Institute, he earnestly sought~
the blessing of God upon it, by constant prayer, by tears, and by stern~
treatment of his own body. In this work, he thrice travelled into Spain in the~
guise of a pilgrim, and begging his bread from door to door. In these his~
journeys he suffered very great hardships, and was most wonderfully holpen of~
the Almighty, especially one while when he was on shipboard and the ship nigh to~
perish, but for the work of his prayers. He toiled hard in those countries to~
attain ' his wishes, but through the widespread fame of his holy life, and the~
noble generosity of the Most Catholic Kings Philip II. and Philip III., he~
overcame with his brave perseverance the opposition of all that withstood him,~
and founded several houses of his Order. This he was able to do in Italy also.

[Lectio6]
There was a great pattern of lowliness, so that when he came to Rome he betook~
himself to an almshouse, and chose a leper for his familiar friend. Paul V.~
offered him divers honours in the Church, but he firmly refused them all. He~
preserved his purity unspotted, and when certain shameless women set themselves~
to attack his chastity, he took the occasion to gain over their souls for~
Christ. Toward God's great mystery of the Eucharist he was drawn with passionate~
tenderness, and would pass almost whole nights without sleep, simply adoring It.~
This godly custom he established in his Order, to be kept up therein for ever,~
the peculiar mark thereof. He was a great encourager of the worship of the~
Maiden Mother of God. He was hot with strong love for his neighbour. He was~
gifted with prophecy, and the discerning of spirits. In the forty -fourth year~
of his age he was continuing long in prayer in the Holy House of Loretto, when~
it was made known to him that the end of his earthly life was at hand. He~
straightway took his way to the Abruzzi, and was there seized with illness while~
he was with the disciples of St Philip Neri, in the town of Agnone. He received~
with great devotion the Sacraments of the Church, and then, upon the 4th day of~
June, being the Eve of the Feast of the Body of Christ, in the year 1608, he~
very peacefully fell asleep in the Lord. His sacred body was carried to Naples,~
and there honourably buried in the Church of St Mary the Greater, where he had~
laid the first foundations of his Order. As he became distinguished for miracles~
Pope Clement XIV. enrolled his name, with solemn pomp, among those of the~
Blessed, and Pope Pius VII., in the year 1807, finding his mighty works continue,~
added it to the list of the Saints.

[Lectio94]
Francis, originally called Ascanio, came from the noble family of the Caracciolo, in the city of Santa Maria della Villa in the Abruzzi. During a severe illness in his youth, he resolved to give himself up completely to the service of God and neighbour. He went to Naples and was ordained priest, after which he devoted himself wholly to contemplation and the winning of souls ; and he was always on hand to comfort prisoners condemned to death. By a wonderful disposition of God, he joined with John Augustine Adorno and Fabrizio Caracciolo in founding the Order of Clerks Regular Minor, adding to the three usual vows another : not to seek dignities. After the death of Adorno, Francis ruled the Order in a most holy way, and with the greatest zeal promoted it throughout Spain and Italy. He burned with such love for the Most Blessed Sacrament that he would spend almost the whole night in adoring it ; and he established adoration of the Blessed Sacrament as a practice to be kept for ever in his Order, the peculiar mark thereof. He was enriched with the gifts of prophecy and the reading of hearts. At length, in his forty-fourth year, he was taken with a deadly fever in the town of Agnone, in the Abruzzi, and fell asleep in the Lord on the 4th day of June, 1608. His holy body was taken to Naples and buried in the church of his Order.
