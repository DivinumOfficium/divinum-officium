Olvasmány Mózes elsõ könyvébõl
!Gen 12:1-6
1 Az Úr így szólt Ábrámhoz: "Vonulj ki földedrõl, rokonságod körébõl és atyád~
házából arra a földre, amelyet majd mutatok neked.
2 Nagy néppé teszlek. Megáldalak és naggyá teszem nevedet, s te magad is áldás~
leszel.
3 Megáldom azokat, akik áldanak téged, de akik átkoznak téged, azokat én is~
megátkozom. Általad nyer áldást a föld minden nemzetsége."
4 Ábrám tehát elköltözött, ahogy az Úr megparancsolta neki, s vele ment Lót is.~
Ábrám 75 éves volt, amikor Háránból elindult.
5 Ábrám vette feleségét, Sárait, az unokaöccsét, Lótot, minden vagyonukat,~
amijük volt és az összes szolgát, akiket Háránban szereztek. Azután elindultak,~
hogy Kánaán földjére menjenek, s meg is érkeztek Kánaán földjére.
6 Ábrám végigvonult az országon Szichem városáig, Móre terebintjéig. A vidéken~
kánaániták laktak.

[Responsory1]
R. The Lord spake unto Abram, saying Get thee out of thy country, and from thy~
kindred, and go unto the land that I will show thee
* And I will make of thee a great nation.
V. I will surely bless thee and make thy name great, and thou shalt be blessed.
R. And I will make of thee a great nation.

[Lectio2]
!Gen 12:7-13
7 Akkor az Úr megjelent Ábrámnak és így szólt hozzá: "Ezt a földet utódaidnak~
adom." Erre õ oltárt épített ott az Úrnak, aki megjelent neki.
8 Innét tovább vonult a hegyvidékre, Bételtõl keletre. Fölverte sátrát, s Bétel~
nyugatra esett, Ai pedig keletre. Aztán oltárt épített az Úrnak és segítségül~
hívta a nevét.
9 Majd tovább vonult a Negeb felé.
10 Amikor éhínség tört ki a vidéken, Ábrám lement Egyiptomba és ott lakott, mint~
jövevény, mert az éhínség súlyosan ránehezedett a vidékre.
11 Amint Egyiptomhoz közeledett, így szólt feleségéhez, Sáraihoz: "Jól tudom,~
hogy szép asszony vagy.
12 Ha az egyiptomiak látnak, azt fogják mondani: Ez a felesége. Engem megölnek,~
téged életben hagynak.
13 Ezért mondd, hogy a húgom vagy, hogy miattad nekem is jó dolgom legyen és~
életben maradjak."

[Responsory2]
R. Abraham stood by the oak of Mamre, and he saw three men coming up by the~
path.
* He saw three, and worshipped One.
V. Behold, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name~
Isaac.
R. He saw three, and worshipped One.

[Lectio3]
!Gen 12:14-19
14 Amikor Ábrám Egyiptomba ért, az egyiptomiak látták, hogy az asszony nagyon~
szép.
15 A fáraó udvari fõtisztviselõi is látták és dicsérték a fáraó elõtt. Az~
asszonyt tehát a fáraó palotájába vitték,
16 Ábrámmal pedig jól bántak miatta. Juhot, szarvasmarhát, szamarat, szolgákat,~
szolgálólányokat, szamárkancát és tevéket ajándékoztak neki.
17 Az Úr azonban súlyos csapással verte meg a fáraót és házát Sárai, Ábrám~
felesége miatt.
18 Erre a fáraó hívatta Ábrámot, és így szólt hozzá: "Mit tettél velem? Miért~
nem vallottad be, hogy a feleséged?
19 Miért állítottad: a húgom -, úgy, hogy feleségül vettem? Most itt a feleséged,~
vedd és távozz!"

[Responsory3]
R. The Lord did tempt Abraham, and said unto him
* Take thy son Isaac whom thou lovest, and offer him there for a burnt-offering~
upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
V. And when the Lord called him, he answered Behold, here I am. And the Lord~
said unto him
R. Take thy son Isaac whom thou lovest, and offer him there for a burnt-offering~
upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
&Gloria
R. Take thy son Isaac whom thou lovest, and offer him there for a burnt-offering~
upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.

[Lectio4]
From the Book upon the Patriarch Abraham written by St Ambrose, Bishop (of~
Milan.)
!Bk. i. 2.
Abraham was truly a great man, illustrious as an example of many virtues; one~
the like of whom the day-dreams of Philosophy have not been able to produce.~
That which she imagineth is less than that which he did; his simple truth and~
faith were something grander than her lying rounded periods. Let us then~
consider what this man's loyalty was. For that virtue is first to be taken which~
was the source of all the others, and thus this was the first which God called~
for from him, when He said: Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred,~
and from thy father's house. It would have been enough to have said, Get thee~
out of thy country, for there were his kindred, and there his father's house.

[Responsory4]
R. The Angel of the Lord called unto Abraham and said
* Lay not thine hand upon the lad; for now I know that thou fearest God.
V. And Abraham stretched forth his hand to slay his son; and, behold, the Angel~
of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said
R. Lay not thy hand upon the lad; for now I know that thou fearest God.

[Lectio5]
But He gave the details of his sacrifice one by one, that He might see whether~
he loved Him, lest also he should begin rashly, or should seek to evade the~
heavenly commandment. But as the whole of the precept was plainly set forth,~
lest anything should be unconsidered, so also were the rewards set forth, lest~
the burden should seem hopeless. He was tried as one that is strong, he was~
roused as one that is true, he was called as one that is righteous; and he~
departed loyally as the Lord had spoken unto him. And Lot went forth with him.~
That saying of the Seven Wise Men of Greece is much spoken of Follow God. But~
this did Abraham before the Seven Wise Men were thought of; he followed God, and~
went out of his own land.

[Responsory5]
R. The Angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time
* And said I will bless thee, and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the~
heaven.
V. thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies, and in thy seed shall all the~
nations of the earth be blessed.
R. And I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven.

[Lectio6]
But, forasmuch as Abraham had before had another country, namely, the land of~
the Chaldees, whence went forth Terah the father of Abraham, and came unto Haran,~
and forasmuch as he to whom it had been said, Get thee out from thy kindred,~
took Lot, his brother's son, with him, let us consider whether this Get thee out~
of thy country signifieth not get thee out of this earthly dwelling, namely,~
our body, from which Paul came forth, who said, Our conversation is in heaven.~
(Phil. iii. 20.)

[Responsory6]
R. O God of my master Abraham, prosper my way which I go
* That I may return again in safety unto the house of my master.
V. O Lord, I pray thee, be merciful unto thy servant
R. That I may return again in safety unto the house of my master.
&Gloria
R. That I may return again in safety unto the house of my master.

Evangélium szent Lukács Evangélista kõnyvébõl
!Luke 18:31-43
Azon idõben Jézus félrevonta a tizenkettõt, s így szólt hozzájuk: "Most~
felmegyünk Jeruzsálembe, s beteljesedik minden, amit a próféták az Emberfiáról~
megjövendöltek. És így tovább.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great.)
!2nd on the Gospels.
Our Redeemer, foreseeing that the minds of His disciples would be troubled by~
His suffering, told them long before both of the pains of that suffering, and of~
the glory of His rising again, to the end that, when they should see Him die as~
He had prophesied, they might not doubt that He was likewise to rise again. But,~
since His disciples were yet carnal, and could not receive the words telling of~
this mystery, He wrought a miracle before them. A blind man received his sight~
before their eyes, that if they could not receive heavenly things by words, they~
might be persuaded of heavenly things by deeds.

[Responsory7]
R. I came this day unto the well, and I besought the Lord, and said
* O Lord God of Abraham, Thou hast prospered my way.
V. Therefore the virgin to whom I shall say Give me water of thy pitcher to~
drink; and she shall say to me Drink, my lord, and I will give thy camels~
drink also; let the same be the woman whom the Lord hath appointed out for my~
master's son.
R. O Lord God of Abraham,

[Lectio8]
But, dearly beloved brethren, we must so take the miracles of our Lord and~
Saviour, as believing both that they were actually wrought, and that they have~
some mystic interpretation for our instruction. For in His works, power speaketh~
one thing and mystery again another. Behold here, for instance. We know not~
historically who this blind man was, but we do know of what he was mystically~
the figure. Mankind is blind, driven out from Eden in the persons of his first~
parents, knowing not the light of heaven, and suffering the darkness of~
condemnation. But, nevertheless, through the coming of his Redeemer, he is~
enlightened, so that now he seeth by hope already the gladness of inward light,~
and walketh by good works in the path of life.

[Responsory8]
R. The word of the Lord came unto Abram, saying
* Fear not, Abram I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
V. For I am the Lord thy God That brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees.
R. Fear not, Abram I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.

[Lectio9]
One must note that as Jesus drew to Jericho a blind man received his sight. Now,~
this name Jericho, being interpreted, signifieth the city of the moon and in~
Holy Scripture the moon is used as a figure of our imperfect flesh, of whose~
gradual corruption her monthly waning is a type. As, therefore, our Maker~
draweth nigh to Jericho, a blind man receiveth his sight. While the Godhead~
taketh. into itself our weak manhood, man receiveth again the light which he had~
lost. By God's suffering in the Manhood, man is raised up toward God. This blind~
man is also well described as sitting by the wayside begging for the Truth~
saith I am the Way.'' (John xiv. 6.)

[Responsory9]
R. As the Lord passed by, a certain blind man sat by the way-side, and cried~
unto Him. And the Lord asked him, saying
* What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? Lord, that I may receive my sight.
V. And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto Him; and when he was~
come near, He asked him, saying
R. What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee?
&Gloria
R. Lord, that I may receive my sight.

[Ant Laudes]
O Lord, according to the multitude of thy tender mercies, * blot out my transgressions.
Thou art my God, * and I will praise thee Thou art my God, and I will exalt thee.
O God, early will I seek thee, * to see thy power.
Sing praises, * and exalt Him above all for ever.
Praise ye the Lord * from the heavens, all His angels.

[Capitulum Laudes]
!1 Cor 13:1
v. Testvérek: Szólhatok az emberek vagy az angyalok nyelvén, ha szeretet nincs~
bennem, csak zengõ érc vagyok vagy pengõ cimbalom.
$Deo gratias

[Ant 2]
Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, * and all things that are written by the Prophets~
concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished for He shall be delivered unto~
the Gentiles, and shall be mocked and spitted on; and they shall scourge Him,~
and put Him to death, and the third day He shall rise again.

[Versum 2]
V. Lord, thou hast been our refuge
R. From generation to generation.

[Ant Prima]
As Jesus went on His way, * as He was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind~
man cried unto Him, that he might worthily receive his sight.

[Ant Tertia]
As the Lord passed by, * a certain blind man cried unto Him Thou Son of David,~
have mercy on me.

[Capitulum Tertia]
!1 Cor 13:1
v. Testvérek: Szólhatok az emberek vagy az angyalok nyelvén, ha szeretet nincs~
bennem, csak zengõ érc vagyok vagy pengõ cimbalom.
$Deo gratias

[Ant Sexta]
And they that went before rebuked him, * that he should hold his peace but he~
cried so much the more Thou Son of David, have mercy on me!

[Capitulum Sexta]
!1 Cor 13:8-9
v. S a szeretet nem szûnik meg soha. A prófétálás végetér, a nyelvek~
elhallgatnak, a tudomány elenyészik. Most megismerésünk csak töredékes, és~
töredékes a prófétálásunk is.
$Deo gratias

[Ant Nona]
The blind man cried on the Lord * so much the more, to give him light.

[Capitulum Nona]
!1 Cor 13:13
v. Addig megmarad a hit, a remény és a szeretet, ez a három, de közülük a~
legnagyobb a szeretet.
$Deo gratias

[Ant 3]
And Jesus stood, * and commanded the blind man to be brought unto Him, and He~
asked him, saying What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? Lord, that I may~
receive my sight. And Jesus said unto him Receive thy sight thy faith hath~
saved thee. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Him, glorifying~
God.

[Versum 3]
V. Let my prayer, O Lord, be set forth.
R. As incense before thee.
