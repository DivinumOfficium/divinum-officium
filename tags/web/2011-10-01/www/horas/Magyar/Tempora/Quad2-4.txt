[Lectio1]
From the holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 16:19-31
Azon idõben mondá Jézus a farizeusoknak: Volt egy gazdag ember. Bíborban és patyolatban járt, és mindennap nagy lakomát rendezett És így tovább.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great.)
!40th on the Gospels.
Whom, dearly beloved brethren, whom are we to understand as signified by that~
rich man which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every~
day, whom, I ask, are we to understand, but the Jewish people, who had all the~
outward life of religious ordinances, and who turned the treasure of the law~
they had received to show and not to use? What but the herd of the Gentiles is~
figured in Lazarus, full of sores? Whosoever turneth himself to God and is not~
ashamed to confess his sin, hath his sores on the skin, for in a sore on the~
skin breaketh out the corruption, which is drawn from within.

[Lectio2]
What is, then, the confession of our sins but the breaking out of our sores? The~
corrupt matter of sin is healthily opened in confession, instead of remaining in~
the mind to rot it. Open sores on the skin bring the poisonous matter to the~
surface, and when we confess our sins, what do we but open up the evil that~
there is lurking in us? But Lazarus desired to be fed with the crumbs which fell~
from the rich man's table, and no man gave unto him; even so did that proud~
people scorn to admit a Gentile to the knowledge of their law. 1

[Lectio3]
The teaching of the law moved them to pride, and not to love, as though they~
swelled with selfimportance at the thought of their riches, and the words which~
some Gentiles caught of their knowledge were as crumbs falling from their~
sumptuous table. On the other hand, the dogs came and licked the sores of the~
beggar that was laid at their gate. Sometimes in Holy Writ, under the figure of~
dogs, preachers are understood. A dog's tongue healeth the sore which it licketh,~
and so do holy teachers, when we confess our sins, and they speak to us, mollify~
by their tongues the sores of our souls.

[Ant 2]
Son, remember * that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and~
likewise Lazarus evil things.

[Oratio 2]
Grant unto us, O Lord, we beseech thee, the help of thy grace, that we, who are~
now bent on fasting and prayer, may be freed from enemies both of our bodies and~
of our souls.
$Per Dominum

[Ant 3]
That rich man * who had refused Lazarus bread-crumbs, cried for a drop of water.

[Oratio 3]
O Lord, help of thy servants, and grant unto their prayers this abiding effect~
of thy mercy that as they do make their boast in thee, that it is Thou which~
hast created and dost govern them, so Thou wilt renew in them the gifts~
wherewith Thou didst bountifully endow them, and wilt preserve what Thou hast~
renewed.
