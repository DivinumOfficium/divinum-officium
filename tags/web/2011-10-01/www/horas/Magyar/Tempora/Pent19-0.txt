Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kõnyvébõl
!Matt 22:1-14
Azon idõben Jézus ismét példabeszédben szólt hozzájuk: A mennyek országa~
hasonlít a királyhoz, aki menyegzõt rendezett a fiának. És így tovább.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great.)
!38th on the Gospels.
I remember that I have often said that, in the Holy Gospel, the Church as she~
now is, is called the kingdom of heaven, for the kingdom of heaven is indeed the~
assembly of the righteous. The Lord hath said by the mouth of His Prophet "~
The heaven is My throne." (Isa. lxvi. 1.) Solomon saith " The throne of wisdom~
is the soul of the righteous." And Paul saith that Christ is " the power of~
God and the wisdom of God." (1 Cor. i. 24.) From these passages we may clearly~
gather that if wisdom be God, and wisdom's throne be the soul of the righteous,~
and God's throne be the heaven, then the soul of the righteous is heaven. Hence~
also the Psalmist saith, speaking of holy preachers " The heavens declare the~
glory of God." (xviii. 2.)

[Lectio8]
Regnum ergo caelorum est Ecclesia justorum: quia dum eorum corda in terra nil~
ambiunt, per hoc quod ad superna suspirant, jam in eis Dominus quasi in~
caelestibus regnat. Dicatur ergö Simile est regnum caelorum homini regi, qui~
fecit nuptias filio suo. Jam intelligit caritas vestra, quis est iste Rex Regis~
filii pater: ille nimirum, cui Psalmista ait: Deus judicium tuum Regi da, et~
justitiam tuam filio Regis. Qui fecit nuptias filio suo. Tunc enim Deus Pater~
Deo Filio suo nuptias fecit, quando hunc in utero Virginis humanae naturae~
conjunxit, quando Deum ante saecula fieri voluit hominem in fine saeculorum.

[Lectio9]
The marriage union is the union of two persons, but God forbid that we should~
imagine that the One Person of our Redeemer Jesus Christ, Who is both God and~
Man, is formed by a union of an human person with a Divine Person. We profess~
concerning Him that He is of, and in two natures, but we shrink from the~
blasphemy of saying that He is compounded of two~
persons. It will therefore be clearer and safer to say that the marriage which~
the Father made for His Royal Son was the wedding Him, through the mystery of~
the Incarnation, to His mystic Bride the Holy Church. The womb of the Maiden~
Mother was the marriage chamber in which this union took place. Hence it is that~
the Psalmist saith: "In the sun hath He set His tabernacle, Who is as a~
bridegroom coming out of his chamber." (xviii. 6.2)

[Ant 2]
Tell them which are bidden * Behold, I have prepared my dinner Come unto the~
marriage. Alleluia.

[Versum 2]
V. The Lord reigneth He is clothed with majesty.
R. The Lord is clothed with strength, and hath girded Himself with power.

[Ant 3]
And the King came in * to see the guests and he saw there a man which had not~
on a wedding garment. And he saith unto him Friend, how camest thou in hither,~
not having a wedding garment

[Versum 3]
V. Let my prayer, O Lord, be set forth.
R. As incense before thee.
