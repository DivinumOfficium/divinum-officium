Evangélium szent János könyvébõl
!John 12:10-36
Azon idõben a fõpapok elhatározták, hogy Lázárt is megölik, mert miatta sok zsidó elment oda, és hitt Jézusban. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo. )
!5 oth Tract on John.
When they saw Lazarus who had been raised from the dead, and knew that the~
miracle which the Lord had worked was so great, spread about by so many~
witnesses, and so plain and manifest that it could neither be concealed nor~
denied, they invented an expedient; and see here what it was But the chief~
Priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death. What stupidity of~
thought, what blindness of cruelty is here! If the Lord Christ had raised up~
again a man who had died a natural death, could He not also raise up one that~
had died by violence? Would killing Lazarus paralyse the Lord? But if ye~
consider that there is a difference between a man dead of disease, and a man~
killed, behold, the Lord hath raised up both for He first raised up Lazarus,~
who had died a natural death, and then Himself, after a violent one.

On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that~
Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, took branches of palm-trees, and went forth to~
meet Him, and cried Hosanna! Blessed is the King of Israel That cometh in the~
Name of the Lord! Palmbranches are glorious boughs which tell of victory; yea,~
the Lord was now ready by His Own Death to trample down death, and to carry the~
victorious banner of His Cross in triumph over the devil, the prince of death.~
The cry with which He was greeted, namely Hosanna, hath not, as we are assured~
by some who are acquainted with the Hebrew language, any meaning in particular,~
but is a shout after the manner of interjections, as they are called, just as in~
Latin when we lament we say Heu, or when we are pleased, Vah. * is, as He Who is~
Lord of our intellect, a Ruler Whose power shall never wane, and Who openeth a~
Kingdom in heaven to all such as centre in Him their faith, their hope, and~
their love.

These were the shouts of applause with which the crowd greeted Him, Hosanna!~
Blessed is the King of Israel That cometh in the Name of the Lord! What inward~
torture must the jealousy of the Jewish leaders have caused them, when they~
heard that great multitude hailing Christ as their King! But, for the Lord, what~
was it to be King of Israel? To the Eternal King what mattered it to become a~
King of men? And Christ is not King of Israel in the sense of monarchs who exact~
tribute, or arm hosts with steel to conquer enemies that are seen. But King of~
Israel He sitting upon the foal of an ass, as had been foretold in the prophecy~
of Zacharias, and the multitude came forth to meet Him carrying branches of~
palmtrees.

[Ant 2]
Father, glorify Thou Me * with thine Own Self, with the glory which had with~
thee before the world was.

[Oratio 2]
O Lord, we beseech thee that thy people, since they are hallowed as thine Own,~
may grow ever in godly love toward thee their Father Who art in heaven, and may~
so be schooled by holy works, that being more and more pleasing in the sight of~
thy Divine Majesty, they may ever receive more and more of thy gifts.

!Phil 2:5-7
v. Testvérek: Ugyanazt a lelkületet ápoljátok magatokban, amely Krisztus~
Jézusban volt. Õ Isten formájában volt, és az Istennel való egyenlõséget nem~
tartotta olyan dolognak, amelyhez föltétlenül ragaszkodnia kell, hanem~
kiüresítette magát, szolgai alakot öltött, és hasonló lett az emberekhez.~
Külsejét tekintve olyan lett, mint egy ember.
$Deo gratias

[Ant 3]
Pater juste, * mundus te non cognovit: ego autem novi te, quia tu me misisti.

[Oratio 3]
Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, qui humano generi, ad imitandum humilitatis exemplum,~
Salvatorem nostrum carnem sumere, et crucem subire fecisti: concede propitius:~
ut et patientiae ipsius habere documenta, et resurrectionis consortia mereamur.
