(Canticle of_Moses * Deut 32:1-27)
32:1 Hear, O ye heavens, the things I speak, * let the earth give ear to the words of my mouth.
32:2 Let my doctrine gather as the rain, * let my speech distil as the dew,
32:3 As a shower upon the herb, and as drops upon the grass. * Because I will invoke the name of the Lord:
32:4 Give ye magnificence to our God. * The works of God are perfect, and all his ways are judgments:
32:5 God is faithful and without any iniquity, he is just and right. * They have sinned against him, and are none of his children in their filth:
32:6 They are a wicked and perverse generation. * Is this the return thou makest to the Lord, O foolish and senseless people?
32:7 Is not he thy father, * that hath possessed thee, and made thee, and created thee? 
32:8 Remember the days of old, * think upon every generation:
32:9 Ask thy father, and he will declare to thee: * thy elders and they will tell thee.
32:10 When the Most High divided the nations: * when he separated the sons of Adam,
32:11 He appointed the bounds of people * according to the number of the children of Israel.
32:12 But the Lord’s portion is his people: * Jacob the lot of his inheritance.
32:13 He found him in a desert land, * in a place of horror, and of vast wilderness:
32:14 He led him about, and taught him: * and he kept him as the apple of his eye.
32:15 As the eagle enticing her young to fly, * and hovering over them,
32:16 He spread his wings, and hath taken him * and carried him on his shoulders.
32:17 The Lord alone was his leader: * and there was no strange god with him.
32:18 He set him upon high land: * that he might eat the fruits of the fields,
32:19 That he might suck honey out of the rock, * and oil out of the hardest stone,
32:20 Butter of the herd, and milk of the sheep * with the fat of lambs, and of the rams of the breed of Basan:
32:21 And goats with the marrow of wheat, * and might drink the purest blood of the grape.
32:22 The beloved grew fat, and kicked: * he grew fat, and thick and gross,
32:23 He forsook God who made him, * and departed from God his saviour.
32:24 They provoked him by strange gods, * and stirred him up to anger, with their abominations.
32:25 They sacrificed to devils and not to God: * to gods whom they knew not:
32:26 That were newly come up, * whom their fathers worshipped not.
32:27 Thou hast forsaken the God that beget * and hast forgotten the Lord that created thee.
