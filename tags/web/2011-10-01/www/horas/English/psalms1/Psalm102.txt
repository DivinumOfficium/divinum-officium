102:1 Bless the Lord, O my soul: * and let all that is within me bless his holy name.
102:2 Bless the Lord, O my soul, * and never forget all he hath done for thee.
102:3 Who forgiveth all thy iniquities: * who healeth all thy diseases.
102:4 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction: * who crowneth thee with mercy and compassion.
102:5 Who satisfieth thy desire with good things: * thy youth shall be renewed like the eagle’s.
102:6 The Lord doth mercies, * and judgment for all that suffer wrong.
102:7 He hath made his ways known to Moses: * his wills to the children of Israel.
102:8 The Lord is compassionate and merciful: * longsuffering and plenteous in mercy.
102:9 He will not always be angry: * nor will he threaten for ever.
102:10 He hath not dealt with us according to our sins: * nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
102:11 For according to the height of the heaven above the earth: * he hath strengthened his mercy towards them that fear him.
102:12 As far as the east is from the west, * so far hath he removed our iniquities from us.
102:13 As a father hath compassion on his children, so hath the Lord compassion on them that fear him: * for he knoweth our frame.
102:14 He remembereth that we are dust: * man’s days are as grass, as the flower of the field so shall he flourish.
102:15 For the spirit shall pass in him, and he shall not be: * and he shall know his place no more.
102:16 But the mercy of the Lord is from eternity * and unto eternity upon them that fear him:
102:17 And his justice unto children’s children, * to such as keep his covenant,
102:18 And are mindful of his commandments * to do them.
102:19 The Lord hath prepared his throne in heaven: * and his kingdom shall rule over all.
102:20 Bless the Lord, all ye his angels: * you that are mighty in strength, and execute his word, hearkening to the voice of his orders.
102:21 Bless the Lord, all ye his hosts: * you ministers of his that do his will.
102:22 Bless the Lord, all his works: * in every place of his dominion, O my soul, bless thou the Lord.
