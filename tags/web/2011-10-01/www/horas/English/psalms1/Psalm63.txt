63:1 Hear, O God, my prayer, when I make supplication to thee: * deliver my soul from the fear of the enemy.
63:2 Thou hast protected me from the assembly of the malignant; * from the multitude of the workers of iniquity.
63:3 For they have whetted their tongues like a sword; * they have bent their bow a bitter thing, to shoot in secret the undefiled.
63:4 They will shoot at him on a sudden, and will not fear: * they are resolute in wickedness.
63:5 They have talked of hiding snares; * they have said: Who shall see them?
63:6 They have searched after iniquities: * they have failed in their search.
63:7 Man shall come to a deep heart: * and God shall be exalted.
63:8 The arrows of children are their wounds: * and their tongues against them are made weak.
63:9 All that saw them were troubled; * and every man was afraid.
63:10 And they declared the works of God: * and understood his doings.
63:11 The just shall rejoice in the Lord, and shall hope in him: * and all the upright in heart shall be praised.
