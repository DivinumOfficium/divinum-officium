122:1 To thee have I lifted up my eyes, * who dwellest in heaven.
122:2 Behold as the eyes of servants * are on the hands of their masters,
122:3 As the eyes of the handmaid are on the hands of her mistress: * so are our eyes unto the Lord our God, until he have mercy on us.
122:4 Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on us: * for we are greatly filled with contempt.
122:5 For our soul is greatly filled: * we are a reproach to the rich, and contempt to the proud.
