79:1 Give ear, O thou that rulest Israel: * thou that leadest Joseph like a sheep.
79:2 Thou that sittest upon the cherubims, * shine forth before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasses.
79:3 Stir up thy might, and come * to save us.
79:4 Convert us, O God: * and shew us thy face, and we shall be saved.
79:5 O Lord God of hosts, * how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy servant?
79:6 How long wilt thou feed us with the bread of tears: * and give us for our drink tears in measure?
79:7 Thou hast made us to be a contradiction to our neighbours: * and our enemies have scoffed at us.
79:8 O God of hosts, convert us: * and shew thy face, and we shall be saved.
79:9 Thou hast brought a vineyard out of Egypt: * thou hast cast out the Gentiles and planted it.
79:10 Thou wast the guide of its journey in its sight: * thou plantedst the roots thereof, and it filled the land.
79:11 The shadow of it covered the hills: * and the branches thereof the cedars of God.
79:12 It stretched forth its branches unto the sea, * and its boughs unto the river.
79:13 Why hast thou broken down the hedge thereof, * so that all they who pass by the way do pluck it?
79:14 The boar out of the wood hath laid it waste: * and a singular wild beast hath devoured it.
79:15 Turn again, O God of hosts, * look down from heaven, and see, and visit this vineyard:
79:16 And perfect the same which thy right hand hath planted: * and upon the son of man whom thou hast confirmed for thyself.
79:17 Things set on fire and dug down * shall perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.
79:18 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand: * and upon the son of man whom thou hast confirmed for thyself.
79:19 And we depart not from thee, thou shalt quicken us: * and we will call upon thy name.
79:20 O Lord God of hosts, convert us: * and shew thy face, and we shall be saved.
