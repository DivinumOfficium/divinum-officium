(Canticum Ecclesiasticae * Eccli 14:22;15:3-4;15:6)
4:22 Blessed is the man that shall continue in wisdom, and that shall meditate in his justice, and in his mind shall think of the all seeing eye of God.
15:3 With the bread of life and understanding, she shall feed him, and give him the water of wholesome wisdom to drink: and she shall be made strong in him, and he shall not be moved:
15:4 And she shall hold him fast, and he shall not be confounded: and she shall exalt him among his neighbours.
15:6 She shall heap upon him a treasure of joy and gladness, and shall cause him to inherit an everlasting name.
