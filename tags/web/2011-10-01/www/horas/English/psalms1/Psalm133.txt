133:1 Behold now bless ye the Lord, * all ye servants of the Lord:
133:2 Who stand in the house of the Lord, * in the courts of the house of our God.
133:3 In the nights lift up your hands to the holy places, * and bless ye the Lord.
133:4 May the Lord out of Sion bless thee, * he that made heaven and earth.
