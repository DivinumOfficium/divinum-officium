From the holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 12:38-50
In that time some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying: Master we~
would see a sign from thee. Who answering said to them: An evil and adulterous~
generation seeketh a sign. And so on.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!7th Bk. on Luke, ch. xii.
After the condemnation of the Jewish people, the mystery of the Church is~
plainly declared in the figures of the repentant Ninevites, and of the Queen of~
the South. Like that Queen, the Church cometh from the uttermost parts of the~
earth, to hear the wisdom of the true Solomon, the Prince of Peace. A Queen~
she is, and a Queen of one indivisible realm, wrought into one body out of all~
nations, however divers and distant.

And thus cometh that great mystery of Christ and the Church, a mystery more~
excellent now in the fulness of truth, than in the ancient type. For there they~
had in Solomon only a type of that which Christ is now in His own Person. And~
the Church is of two classes, whereof the one knoweth not how to sin, and the~
other sinneth no more. To wash away sin is the work of repentance, to eschew it~
that of wisdom.

Hastily, the sign of the Prophet Jonas, as it was a figure of the fully to he~
Lord's sufferings, was also a witness to the gravity of those sins which the~
Jews committed. At the same time, we see in these words of the Lord a~
declaration at once of His power, and of His love; for, by turning our eyes on~
the Ninevites, He showeth us a way of escape, while He setteth before us the~
horror of what will otherwise be our punishment. Even the Jewsneed not cease to~
hope for pardon, if only they would repent.

[Ant 2]
This evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; * and there shall no~
sign be given to it, but the sign of the Prophet Jonas.

[Oratio 2]
O,Lord, we beseech thee, mercifully to hear our prayers, and to stretch forth~
the right hand of thy power against all things that fight against us.
$Per Dominum.

[Ant 3]
As Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly, * so shall the~
Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.

[Oratio 3]
O Lord, we beseech thee to cast thy bright beams of light upon our mind that we~
may clearly see whatsoever things Thou wouldst have us to do, and have strength~
to do always that is pleasing in thy sight.
$Per Dominum.

v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 12:38-50
12:38 Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying: Master we would see a sign from thee.
12:39 Who answering said to them: An evil and adulterous generation seeketh a sign: and a sign shall not be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.
12:40 For as Jonas was in the whale's belly three days and three nights: so shall the Son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.
12:41 The men of Ninive shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they did penance at the preaching of Jonas. And behold a greater than Jonas here.
12:42 The queen of the south shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold a greater than Solomon here.
12:43 And when an unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through dry places seeking rest, and findeth none.
12:44 Then he saith: I will return into my house from whence I came out. And coming he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.
12:45 Then he goeth, and taketh with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man in made worse than the first. So shall it be also to this wicked generation.
12:46 As he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold his mother and his brethren stood without, seeking to speak to him.
12:47 And one said unto him: Behold thy mother and thy brethren stand without, seeking thee.
12:48 But he answering him that told him, said: Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?
12:49 And stretching forth his hand towards his disciples, he said: Behold my mother and my brethren.
12:50 For whosoever shall do the will of my Father, that is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.
