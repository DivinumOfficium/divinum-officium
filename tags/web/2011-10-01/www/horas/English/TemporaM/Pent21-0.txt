From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 18:23-35
At that time Jesus spake unto His disciples this parable The kingdom of~
heaven is likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants.~
And so on.
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Bk, iii. Comment, on Matth. xviii.
It is a way much in use with the Syrians, and especially with the inhabitants of~
Palestine, to illustrate their discourse with parables, that what their hearers~
may not be able to catch so easily when spoken plainly, they may lay hold on by~
dint of comparisons and examples. Thus it was that the Lord, by an allegory~
about a Royal master and a servant who owed him ten thousand talents, and who~
obtained by entreaty forgiveness of the debt, taught Peter how it was his duty~
to forgive his fellow-servants their comparatively trifling offences. For if~
that Royal master so readily forgave his servant his debt of ten thousand~
talents, should not his servants much more forgive lesser debts unto their~
fellows

[Lectio8]
Let put this more clearly, let us take a case. If one of us were to commit~
adultery, or murder, or sacrilege, our sin, great like a debt of ten thousand~
talents, would be forgiven us in answer to prayer, if we also from our heart~
forgive our brethren their trespasses against us. But if we refuse to forgive a~
slight, and keep up unceasing enmity because of an unkind word, how just doth it~
appear that we should be cast into prison, and entail on ourselves, by the~
example of our own deeds, that our great debt should not be forgiven unto us.

[Lectio9]
So likewise shall My heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts~
forgive not every one his brother their trespasses." God's awful purpose can be~
turned and changed but if we will not forgive unto our brethren small things,~
God will not forgive us great things. And if we forgive them, it must be from~
our hearts. Any one can say: I have nothing against such-an-one he knoweth~
what he hath done, and God will judge him for it I do not care what he doeth I~
have forgiven him. But the Lord maketh His sentence clear, and destroyeth such a~
mockery of peace as this, where He saith " So likewise shall My heavenly~
Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his~
brother their trespasses."

[Ant 2]
The lord said unto his servant Pay me * that thou owest. But the servant fell~
down and besought him, saying Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.

[Versum 2]
V. The Lord reigneth He is clothed with majesty.
R. The Lord is clothed with strength, and hath girded Himself with power.

[Ant 3]
O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all * that debt, because thou desiredst~
me. Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow-servant, even as I~
had pity on thee Alleluia.

[Versum 3]
V. Let my prayer, O Lord, be set forth.
R. As incense before thee.

Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 18:23-35
18:23 Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened to a king, who would take an account of his servants.
18:24 And when he had begun to take the account, one was brought to him, that owed him ten thousand talents.
18:25 And as he had not wherewith to pay it, his lord commanded that he should be sold, and his wife and children and all that he had, and payment to be made.
18:26 But that servant falling down, besought him, saying: Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.
18:27 And the lord of that servant being moved with pity, let him go and forgave him the debt.
18:28 But when that servant was gone out, he found one of his fellow servants that owed him an hundred pence: and laying hold of him, throttled him, saying: Pay what thou owest.
18:29 And his fellow servant falling down, besought him, saying: Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.
18:30 And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he paid the debt.
18:31 Now his fellow servants seeing what was done, were very much grieved, and they came and told their lord all that was done.
18:32 Then his lord called him; and said to him: Thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all the debt, because thou besoughtest me:
18:33 Shouldst not thou then have had compassion also on thy fellow servant, even as I had compassion on thee?
18:34 And his lord being angry, delivered him to the torturers until he paid all the debt.
18:35 So also shall my heavenly Father do to you, if you forgive not every one his brother from your hearts.
