Lesson from the letter of St Jude the Apostle
!Jude 1:1-4
1 Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James: to them that are~
beloved in God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called.
2 Mercy unto you, and peace, and charity be fulfilled.
3 Dearly beloved, taking all care to write unto you concerning your common~
salvation, I was under a necessity to write unto you: to beseech you to contend~
earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints.
4 For certain men are secretly entered in, (who were written of long ago unto~
this judgment,) ungodly men, turning the grace of our Lord God into riotousness,~
and denying the only sovereign Ruler, and our Lord Jesus Christ

!Jude 1:5-8
5 I will therefore admonish you, though ye once knew all things, that Jesus,~
having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, did afterwards destroy them~
that believed not:
6 And the angels who kept not their principality, but forsook their own~
habitation, he hath reserved under darkness in everlasting chains, unto the~
judgment of the great day.
7 As Sodom and Gomorrha, and the neighbouring cities, in like manner, having~
given themselves to fornication, and going after other flesh, were made an~
example, suffering the punishment of eternal fire.
8 In like manner these men also defile the flesh, and despise dominion, and~
blaspheme majesty

!Jude 1:9-13
9 When Michael the archangel, disputing with the devil, contended about the body~
of Moses, he durst not bring against him the judgment of railing speech, but~
said: The Lord command thee.
10 But these men blaspheme whatever things they know not: and what things soever~
they naturally know, like dumb beasts, in these they are corrupted.
11 Woe unto them, for they have gone in the way of Cain: and after the error of~
Balaam they have for reward poured out themselves, and have perished in the~
contradiction of Core.
12 These are spots in their banquets, feasting together without fear, feeding~
themselves, clouds without water, which are carried about by winds, trees of the~
autumn, unfruitful, twice dead, plucked up by the roots,
13 Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own confusion; wandering stars, to~
whom the storm of darkness is reserved for ever

From the Sermons of St Austin, Bishop of Hippo.
!Same as before.
Dearly beloved brethren, if the Flesh wherein our Saviour trampled down the~
devil had not been of our nature, He would indeed have exercised Himself, but He~
would not have conquered for us. If the Body wherein He rose from the grave had~
not been of our nature, His Resurrection would not have affected our state.~
Whoso asserteth this, that Christ hath but one nature, he doth not understand~
why Christ took Flesh upon Him, he confoundeth the order, j and maketh void the~
benefit of the Incarnation. If the Flesh wherein our Healer came was not sharer~
in human | nature, then all that by His Birth He took from man would have been~
degradation. O may such dangerous! dreams be far from our thoughts What He~
took is ours, what He gave is His. I testify that the first Adam, who fell, and~
the second Adam, Who rose from the dead, are both of the' same human nature~
that I am of. I i testify that What lay in the grave,) and What ascended into~
heaven, is of the same human nature that I am of.

[Lectio5]
It was therefore just because His: Body was of our nature, that; Christ's Death~
hath quickened us, His Resurrection raised us up, His Ascen-i sion sanctified~
us. It was just because His Body was of our nature,! that His Presence in the~
heavenly! kingdoms is a pledge that we also shall one day be there. Let us~
therefore strive, dearly beloved brethren, since the Lord hath on this day gonei~
up on high in a Body of our nature,, ourselves, as far as we can, to ascend~
thither in hope, to follow Him with our heart. Let us ascend to Him in love, and~
speed keeping pace with love, even by our very sins and passions. If every one~
of us would strive to get above them, and accustom himself to tread on them, he~
might make of even them a stepping-stone to mount to higher things. Such things~
lift us up if they are underneath us.

[Lectio6]
We make our vices a ladder, if we tread them down. With the Author of goodness~
there ascended no spite with the Son of the Virgin, no lust or sensuality. I~
say vices do not follow to heaven the Father of perfection, sin the Holy One of~
God, neither weakness nor disease the Divine Healer. If therefore we would enter~
into the kingdom of that Healer, we must first take heed to our sores. We must~
so order and guard in us the mutual relations of our soul and body, that the~
soul, the nobler part of man, may not be dragged down to hell by her grovelling~
companion, but may rather, being herself of a nature more glorious, bear with~
her to heaven at the last a sanctified body, by the help of Him Who liveth and~
reigneth for ever and ever. Amen.

From the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 15:26-27; 16:1-4
At that time Jesus said unto His disciples: When the Comforter is come, whom I~
will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, Which proceedeth~
from the Father, He shall testify of Me. And so on.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop of Hippo.
!92nd Tract on John.
Upon the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost came down upon a congregation of an~
hundred and twenty men, among whom were all the Apostles. These men, after they~
had been filled with the Spirit, began to speak with the tongues of all nations,~
and many of the bystanders, amazed at the marvel, when they saw in the discourse~
of Peter, how great and how Divine a witness was borne to the fact that the~
Christ, Whom they had murdered, and Whom they reckoned among the dead, had risen~
again and was alive, many of these bystanders were pricked in their heart (Acts~
ii. $7) an d were converted. They received pardon from that noble Blood, Which~
they had so sacrilegiously and so brutally shed, seeing that that Blood had~
redeemed even Its Own out-pourers.

[Lectio8]
The Blood of Christ "Which is shed for many for the remission of sins" was so~
effectually shed, that It could remit even the very sin that shed It. Toward~
this looked the Lord when He said " They hated Me without a cause but when~
the Comforter is come, Whom I will send unto you from the Father, He shall~
testify of Me." This was as though He had said They have hated Me and slain Me~
while they see Me, but when they shall see Me no more, the Comforter shall bear~
such testimony of Me, as will compel them to believe in Me. " And ye also,"~
saith He, " shall bear witness, because ye have been with Me from the beginning,"~
the Holy Ghost shall bear witness, and ye also shall bear witness. " Because~
ye have been with Me from the beginning," ye are able to speak that ye do know,~
(John iii. 11,) which ye do not now, while as yet the fulness of the Spirit is~
not come upon you.

[Lectio9]
He shall testify of Me and ye also shall bear witness when the love of God~
is shed abroad in your hearts by the Holy Ghost Which shall be given unto you,~
and maketh you not ashamed to lift up your testimony. This love had not been so~
shed abroad in Peter's heart when he was frightened by the questioning of the~
maid-servant, and could not bear witness to the truth, but brake his promise,~
and was driven by strong fear to deny Christ thrice. "There is no" such "fear in~
love; but perfect love casteth out fear." Before the Passion of the Lord,~
Peter's slavish fear was questioned by a bondwoman but after the Resurrection~
of the Lord, his free love was asked by the very Prince of freedom, and~
therefore the first questioning shook him, but under the second he was at peace~
at the first he denied Him Whom he had loved at the second he loved Him Whom~
he had denied. But, even so, his love was weak and narrow, until the Holy Ghost~
had strengthened and widened it.

Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 15:26-27; 16:1-4
15:26 But when the Paraclete cometh, whom I will send you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceedeth from the Father, he shall give testimony of me.
15:27 And you shall give testimony, because you are with me from the beginning.
16:1 THESE things have I spoken to you, that you may not be scandalized.
16:2 They will put you out of the synagogues: yea, the hour cometh, that whosoever killeth you, will think that he doth a service to God.
16:3 And these things will they do to you; because they have not known the Father, nor me.
16:4 But these things I have told you, that when the hour shall come, you may remember that I told you of them.
