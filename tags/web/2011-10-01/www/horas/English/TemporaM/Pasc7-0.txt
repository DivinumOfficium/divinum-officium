v. Creator-Spirit, all-divine,
Come, visit every soul of thine,
And fill with thy celestial flame
The hearts which thou thyself didst frame.
_
O gift of God, thine is the sweet
Consoling name of Paraclete
And spring of life and fire and love
And unction flowing from above.
_
The mystic sevenfold gifts are thine,
Finger of God's right hand divine;
The Father's promise sent to teach
The tongue a rich and heavenly speech.
_
Kindle with fire brought from above
Each sense, and fill our hearts with love;
And grant our flesh, so weak and frail,
The strength of thine which cannot fail.
_
Drive far away our deadly foe,
And grant us thy true peace to know;
So we, led by thy guidance still,
May safely pass through every ill.
_
To us, through thee, the grace be shown
To know the Father and the Son;
And Spirit of them both, may we
Forever rest our faith in thee.
_
To Sire and Son be praises meet,
And to the Holy Paraclete;
And may Christ send us from above
That Holy Spirit's gift of love.
Amen

[Hymnus Matutinum]
v. Now Christ, ascending whence he came,
Had mounted o'er the starry frame,
The Holy Ghost on man below,
The Father's promise, to bestow.
_
The solemn time was drawing nigh,
Replete with heav'nly mystery,
On seven days' sevenfold circles borne,
That first and blessèd Whitsun-morn.
_
When the third hour shone all around,
There came a rushing mighty sound,
And told the Apostles, while in prayer,
That, as was promised, God was there.
_
Forth from the Father's light it came,
That beautiful and kindly flame:
To fill with fervour of his word
The spirits faithful to their Lord.
_
With joy the Apostles' breasts are fired,
By God the Holy Ghost inspired:
And straight, in divers kinds of speech,
The wondrous works of God they preach.
_
To men of every race they speak,
Alike barbarian, Roman, Greek:
From the same lips, with awe and fear,
All men their native accents hear.
_
But Juda's sons, e'en faithless yet,
With mad infuriate rage beset,
To mock Christ's followers combine,
As drunken all with new-made wine.
_
When lo! with signs and mighty deeds,
Stands Peter in the midst, and pleads;
Confounding their malignant lie
By Joel's ancient prophecy.
_
To God the Father let us sing,
To God the Son, our risen King,
And equally let us adore
The Spirit, God forevermore.
Amen.

Lesson from the Acts of Apostles
!Acts 2:1-7
1 And when the days of the Pentecost were accomplished, they were all together in one place: 
2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a mighty wind coming, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. 
3 And there appeared to them parted tongues as it were of fire, and it sat upon every one of them: 
4 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they began to speak with divers tongues, according as the Holy Ghost gave them to speak. 
5 Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem, Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.
6 And when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded in mind, because that every man heard them speak in his own tongue.
7 And they were all amazed, and wondered, saying: Behold, are not all these, that speak, Galileans?

!Acts 2:8-14
8 And how have we heard, every man our own tongue wherein we were born? 
9 Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and inhabitants of Mesopotamia, Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, 
10 Phrygia, and Pamphylia, Egypt, and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome,
11 Jews also, and proselytes, Cretes, and Arabians: we have heard them speak in our own tongues the wonderful works of God. 
12 And they were all astonished, and wondered, saying one to another: What meaneth this? 
13 But others mocking, said: These men are full of new wine. 
14 But Peter standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and spoke to them: Ye men of Judea, and all you that dwell in Jerusalem, be this known to you, and with your ears receive my words.

!Acts 2:15-21
15 For these are not drunk, as you suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day:
16 But this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel: 
17 And it shall come to pass, in the last days, (saith the Lord,) I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams. 
18 And upon my servants indeed, and upon my handmaids will I pour out in those days of my spirit, and they shall prophesy. 
19 And I will shew wonders in the heaven above, and signs on the earth beneath: blood and fire, and vapour of smoke. 
20 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and manifest day of the Lord come.
21 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved.

S. Leo the Great; 
!Sermon 1 on Pentecost. Ch. 1
Dearly beloved, all Catholics know in their hearts that Pentecost is to be esteemed as one of the most important festivals. There is no question but that we owe great reverence to that day which the Holy Spirit has sanctified by his most excellent and wondrous Gift.  

[Responsory4]
R. There appeared + unto the Apostles cloven tongues like as of fire, alleluia:
* And the Holy Ghost rested upon each one of them, alleluia, alleluia.
V. And they began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.
R. And the Holy Ghost rested upon each one of them, alleluia, alleluia.

[Lectio5]
For this is the tenth day since the Lord ascended high above all heavens to sit down at the right hand of God the Father, and it is the fiftieth since his Resurrection, whereon the Lord initiated and made manifest mighty mysteries, binding together the old and the new covenants: thereby plainly revealing that grace was foreshadowed by the law, and that law has been perfected by grace.

[Responsory5]
R. The Apostles did speak + with other tongues the wonderful works of God,
* As the Spirit gave them utterance, alleluia.
V. They were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak.
R. As the Spirit gave them utterance, alleluia.

[Lectio6]
For as of old, when the Hebrews had been freed from the yoke of the Egyptians, the Law was given on Mount Sinai on the fiftieth day after the scacrifice of the Passover Lamb; so after the Passion when the true Lamb of god was slain, the Holy Spirit descended upon the Apostles and upon the company of believers on the fiftieth day after his resurrection, in order that the faithful Christian  might truly perceive that the mysteries of the Old Testament provide the foundations of the Gospel, and that the second Covenant was established by the same Spirit which had instituted the first.
!Cap. II
From this day, therefore the preaching of the Gospel hath sounded forth like a trumpet; from this day the gentle rain of the gifts of the Spirit, the rivers of blessings, have watered all the dry and thirsty desert: for the Spirit of the Lord moved upon the face of the waters, that he might renew the face of the earth.; the new flames shone forth to chase away the old darkness with the brilliancy of fiery tongues and the clarity of the Word of God; flaming eloquence is conceived, from which proceeds understanding and the doing away of sins, through the Spirit's power of consuming and enlightening as by fire. 

[Responsory6]
R. Go ye into the whole world and preach the Gospel, alleluia:
* He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, alleluia,alleluia, alleluia.
V. In my name shallt hey cast out devils; they shall speak with tongues" they shall take up serpents.

From the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 14:13-31
At that time Jesus said unto His disciples If a man love Me. He will keep My~
word, and My Father will love him, and We will come unto him, and make Our~
abode with him. And so on.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory the Great.
!30 tk on the Gospels.
Dearly beloved brethren, our best way will be to run briefly through the words~
which have been read from the Holy Gospel, and thereafter rest for a while~
quietly gazing upon the solemn subject of this great Festival. This is the day~
whereon "suddenly there came a sound from heaven," and the Holy Ghost descended~
upon the Apostles, and, for fleshly minds, gave them minds wherein the love of~
God was shed abroad and, while without "there appeared unto them cloven~
tongues, like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them," within, their hearts~
were enkindled. While they received the visible presence of God in the form of~
fire, the flames of His love enwrapped them. The Holy Ghost Himself is love~
whence it is that John saith "God is love." Whosoever therefore loveth God with all his~
soul, already hath obtained Him Whom he loveth for no man is able to love God,~
if He have not gained Him Whom he loveth.

[Responsory7]
R. The Holy Ghost, Which proceedeth from the Throne, entered unseen into the~
hearts of the Apostles, with a new token of sanctification, even
* That all manner of tongues should spring to their lips. Alleluia.
V. The fire of God fell, not to burn them, but to enlighten them, and gave them~
gifts of grace.
R. That all manner of tongues should spring to their lips. Alleluia.
&Gloria
R. That all manner of tongues should spring to their lips. Alleluia.

[Lectio8]
But, behold, now, if I shall ask any one of you whether he loveth God, he will~
answer with all boldness and quietness of spirit " I do love him." But at the~
very beginning of this day's Lesson from the Gospel, ye have heard what the~
Truth saith " If a man love Me, he will keep My word." The test, then, of love,~
is whether it is showed by works. Hence the same John hath said in his Epistle~
(I. iv. 20, v. 3) "If a man say, I love God, and keepeth not His commandments,~
He is a liar." Then do we indeed love God, and keep His commandments, if we deny~
ourselves the gratification of our appetites. Whosoever still wandereth after~
unlawful desires, such an one plainly loveth not God, for he saith, Nay, to that~
which God willeth.

[Responsory8]
R. The Holy Ghost filled all the house where the Apostles were and there~
appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.
* And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak in divers~
tongues as the Holy Spirit gave them utterance. Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
V. When the disciples were all with one accord in one place, for fear of the~
Jews, suddenly there came a sound from heaven upon them.
R. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak in divers~
tongues as the Holy Spirit gave them utterance. Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
&Gloria
R. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak in divers~
tongues, as the Holy Spirit gave them utterance. Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.

[Lectio9].
And My Father will love him, and We will come unto him, and make Our abode with~
him." O my dearly beloved brethren, think what a dignity is that, to have God~
abiding as a guest in our heart Surely if some rich man or some powerful~
friend were to come into our house, we would hasten to have our whole house~
cleaned, lest, perchance, when he came in, he should see aught to displease his~
eye. So let him that would make his mind an abode for God, cleanse it from all~
the filth of works of iniquity. Lo, again, what saith the Truth " We will come~
unto him, and make Our abode with him." There are some hearts whereunto God~
cometh, but maketh not His abode therein with a certain pricking they feel His~
Presence, but in time of temptation they forget that which hath pricked them~
and so they turn again to work unrighteousness, even as though they had never~
repented.

[Responsory9]
R. The Spirit of the Lord filleth the world. 
*. And That Which containeth all things hath knowledge of the voice. Alleluia, Alleluia.

[Hymnus Laudes]
v. Round roll the weeks our hearts to greet,
With blissful joy returning;
For lo! the Holy Paraclete
On twelve bright brows sits burning:
_
With quivering flame he lights on each,
In fashion like a tongue, to teach
That eloquent they are of speech,
Their hearts with true love yearning.
_
While with all tongues they speak to all,
The nations deem them maddened,
And drunk with wine the prophets call,
Whom God's good Spirit gladdened;
_
A marvel thisin mystery done
The holy paschaltide outrun,
By numbers told, whose reckoning won
Remission for the saddened.
_
O God most Holy, thee we pray,
With reverent brow low bending,
Grant us the Spirit's gifts today
The gifts from heaven descending;
_
And, since, thy grace hath deigned to bide
Within our breasts once sanctified,
Deign, Lord, to cast our sins aside,
Henceforth calm seasons sending.
_
To God the Father, laud and praise,
Praise to the Son be given;
Praise to the Spirit of all grace,
The fount of graces seven
_
As was of old, all worlds before,
Is now and shall be evermore,
When time and change are spent and o'er
All praise in earth and heaven.
Amen.

The mystic sevenfold gifts are thine,
Finger of God's right hand divine;

_
Findle with fire brought from above
Each sense, and fill our hearts with love;
And grant our flesh, so weak and frail,
The strength of thine which cannot fail.
_
Drive far away our deadly foe,
And grant us thy true peace to know;
So we, led by thy guidance still,
May safely pass through every ill.
_
To us, through thee, the grace be shown
To know the Father and the Son;
And Spirit of Them both, may we
Forever rest our faith in thee.

And may Christ send us from above
That Holy Spirit's gift of love.

Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 14:13-31
14:13 Because I go to the Father: and whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name, that will I do: that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
14:14 If you shall ask me any thing in my name, that I will do.
14:15 If you love me, keep my commandments.
14:16 And I will ask the Father, and he shall give you another Paraclete, that he may abide with you for ever.
14:17 The spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, nor knoweth him: but you shall know him; because he shall abide with you, and shall be in you.
14:18 I will not leave you orphans, I will come to you.
14:19 Yet a little while: and the world seeth me no more. But you see me: because I live, and you shall live.
14:20 In that day you shall know, that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.
14:21 He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them; he it is that loveth me. And he that loveth me, shall be loved of my Father: and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.
14:22 Judas saith to him, not the Iscariot: Lord, how is it, that thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and not to the world?
14:23 Jesus answered, and said to him: If any one love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and will make our abode with him.
14:24 He that loveth me not, keepeth not my words. And the word which you have heard, is not mine; but the Father's who sent me.
14:25 These things have I spoken to you, abiding with you.
14:26 But the Paraclete, the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring all things to your mind, whatsoever I shall have said to you.
14:27 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, do I give unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, nor let it be afraid.
14:28 You have heard that I said to you: I go away, and I come unto you. If you loved me, you would indeed be glad, because I go to the Father: for the Father is greater than I.
14:29 And now I have told you before it comes to pass: that when it shall come to pass, you may believe.
14:30 I will not now speak many things with you. For the prince of this world cometh, and in me he hath not any thing.
14:31 But that the world may know, that I love the Father: and as the Father hath given me commandment, so do I: Arise, let us go hence.
