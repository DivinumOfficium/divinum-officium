Lesson from the first book of Kings
!1 Kgs 2:1-4
1 And the days of David drew nigh that he should die, and he charged his son~
Solomon, saying:
2 I am going the way of all flesh: take thou courage, and show thyself a man.
3 And keep the charge of the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and observe his~
ceremonies, and his precepts, and judgments, and testimonies, as it is written~
in the law of Moses: that thou mayest understand all thou dost, and~
whithersoever thou shalt turn thyself:
4 That the Lord may confirm his words, which he hath spoken of me, saying: If~
thy children shall take heed to their ways, and shall walk before me in truth,~
with all their heart, and with all their soul, there shall not be taken away~
from thee a man on the throne of Israel.

!1 Kgs 2:5-6
5 Thou knowest also what Joab the son of Sarvia hath done to me, what he did to~
the two captains of the army of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa~
the son of Jether: whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the~
blood of war on his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were~
on his feet.
6 Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoary head go down to~
hell in peace.

!1 Kgs 2:7-9
7 But show kindness to the sons of Berzellai the Galaadite, and let them eat at~
thy table: for they met me when I fled from the face of Absalom thy brother.
8 Thou hast also with thee Semei the son of Gera the son of Jemini of Bahurim,~
who cursed me with a grievous curse, when I went to the camp: but because he~
came down to meet me when I passed over the Jordan, and I swore to him by the~
Lord, saying: I will not kill thee with a sword:
9 Do not thou hold him guiltless. But thou art a wise man, and knowest what to~
do with him, and thou shalt bring down his grey hairs with blood to hell.
