From the holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 17:1-9
In that time Jesus taketh unto him Peter and James, and John his brother, and~
bringeth them up into a high mountain apart: And he was transfigured before~
them. And so on.
_
Homily by Pope St Leo (the Great.)
!On the Transfiguration of the Lord.
Dearly beloved brethren, the Lesson from the Holy Gospel which, entering in by~
our bodily ears, hath knocked at the door of our inner mind, calleth us to~
understand a great mystery. This, by the grace of God, we shall the more readily~
do, if we return to consider what hath been told us just before. The Saviour of~
mankind, even Jesus Christ, laying the foundations of that faith whereby the~
ungodly are called to righteousness and the dead to life, instilled into the~
minds of His disciples, both by the voice of His teaching and the wonder of His~
works, that they should believe Him, the one Christ, to be both the~
Only-begotten Son of God and the Son of man. Had they believed Him one of these~
and not the other, it had availed them nothing to salvation; and the danger was~
equally great, of holding the Lord Jesus Christ to be God without the Manhood,~
or Man only without the Godhead, since we are constrained to acknowledge that He~
is perfect God and perfect Man, and that as there is in the Godhead perfect~
Manhood, so there is in the Manhood perfect Godhead.

To strengthen, therefore, the saving knowledge of this faith, the Lord had asked~
His disciples what, among the differing opinions of men, I was their own belief~
and judgment as to Who He was. Then did the Apostle Peter, by the revelation of~
That Father Who is above all, rising above fleshly things, yea, outstripping the~
thoughts of men, then did he fix the eyes of his mind upon the Son of the living~
God, and confess the glory of the Godhead, for he looked not on the substance of~
the flesh and blood only. And in all the exaltation of this faith so well did he~
please God, that he was gifted with that joyous blessing, the hallowed~
establishment of that impregnable rock, whereon the Church beingfounded, should~
prevail against the gates of hell and the laws of death; neither, when anything~
is to be bound or loosed, is any bound or loosed in heaven, otherwise than as~
the judgment of Peter hath bound or loosed it upon earth.

But, dearly beloved brethren, it behoved that the height of this understanding,~
which the Lord praised, should rest upon a foundation, and that foundation, the~
mystery of the lower nature, lest the faith of the Apostle, carried away by the~
glorious acknowledgment of the Godhead in Christ, should deem it unworthy and~
unnatural for the impassible God to take into Himself the frailty of our nature;~
and should thus believe that n Christ the Manhood had been so glorified as to be~
no longer able to suffer pain, or be dissolved in death. And therefore it was~
that, when the Lord said how that He must go up unto Jerusalem, and suffer many~
things of the elders and chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and rise~
again the third day, and the blessed Peter, bright with heavenly illumination,~
and still glowing from the passionate acknowledgment of the Divine Sonship, by a~
natural, and, as seemed to him, a godly shrinking, could not bear the mention of~
mockery and insult and a cruel death, he was corrected by the merciful rebuke of~
Jesus, and moved rather to desire to be a partaker in the sufferings of his~
Master.

Look down mercifully, O Lord, we beseech thee, upon thy people, and graciously~

v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 17:1-9
17:1 AND after six days Jesus taketh unto him Peter and James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart:
17:2 And he was transfigured before them. And his face did shine as the sun: and his garments became white as snow.
17:3 And behold there appeared to them Moses and Elias talking with him.
17:4 And Peter answering, said to Jesus: Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
17:5 And as he was yet speaking, behold a bright cloud overshadowed them. And lo, a voice out of the cloud, saying: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased: hear ye him.
17:6 And the disciples hearing, fell upon their face, and were very much afraid.
17:7 And Jesus came and touched them: and said to them, Arise, and fear not.
17:8 And they lifting up their eyes saw no one but only Jesus.
17:9 And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying: Tell the vision to no man, till the Son of man be risen from the dead.
