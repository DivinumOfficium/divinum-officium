04-23# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 65: Concerning the Provost of the Monastery. Continued.
_
And so we foresee that it is expedient, for the preservation of peace and charity, that the ordering of his monastery be within the abbot’s discretion. And if it can be done, let the whole of the activity of the monastery be organized through deans as we have above arranged, as the abbot shall appoint, so that since it is entrusted to many no one may become proud. But if either the needs of the place require it, or the community shall have asked reasonably and humbly and the abbot shall have judged it to be expedient, the abbot may himself appoint to be his provost whomsoever with the counsel of God-fearing brethren he shall have chosen. And let the said provost see with reverence to such things as shall have been enjoined him by his abbot, doing nothing contrary to the abbot’s wish or order; for, as much as he has been promoted over the others, by so much it behoves him carefully to observe the precepts of the rule. But if the said provost shall be found culpable, or deceived by the haughtiness of pride, or shall be proved a despiser of the holy rule, let him be admonished by words until the fourth time: if he shall not have amended, let the correction of the discipline of the rule be applied to him. But if even so he be not corrected, then let him be deposed from the rank of provostship and in his place let some other who is worthy be substituted. But if after this also he shall not be quiet and obedient in the community, let him even be expelled from the monastery.

Let the abbot however have in mind that concerning all his decisions he renders account to God, lest haply the flame of envy and jealousy enkindle his mind.
