02-24# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 18: In What Order the Psalms Themselves Are to Be Said. Continued.
_
The order of the day psalmody having been thus arranged, let all the rest of the psalms that remain over be equally distributed among the seven night offices, by means of dividing those of the psalms which are somewhat long; and let twelve be assigned to each night. We particularly advise however that if haply this distribution of the psalms be displeasing to anyone he set it in order, if he judge it to be better when arranged otherwise, so long as this be in any case attended to, namely, that every week the psalter be recited to the entire number of a hundred and fifty psalms and always be begun afresh at Lord’s day night office; because monks show great sloth in their devotional service if they recite less in the course of a week than the psalter with the accustomed canticles, seeing that we read our holy fathers strenuously accomplished in one day this which oh, that we tepid ones may fulfil in a whole week!
