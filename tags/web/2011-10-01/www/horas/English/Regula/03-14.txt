03-14# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 35: Concerning the Weekly Kitcheners. Continued.
_
And let the weekly kitcheners each receive, over and above the appointed portion, somewhat to drink and bread, one hour before refection, that they may serve their brethren at the hour of refection without murmuring or great labour: on solemnities however let them wait until after Mass. On Sunday let the in-coming and the out-going weekly officials prostrate themselves before all the brethren in the oratory at the end of Lauds and ask prayers for themselves; and let the one going out from the week’s work say this versicle: “Blessed art Thou, O Lord God, because Thou hast holpen me and comforted me”; and when this has been said thrice let the one going out receive his blessing. Then let the one coming in follow on and say: “O God, make speed to save me; O Lord, make haste to help me”; and let this likewise be repeated thrice by all and the blessing received let him enter upon his office.
