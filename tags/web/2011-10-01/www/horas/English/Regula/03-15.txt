03-15# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 36: Concerning the Sick and Infirm Brethren
_
Before all things and above all things care is to be had of the sick, that they may be so served as if they were in very deed Christ, because He Himself said: “I have been sick and ye have visited Me”: and: “What ye have done to one from among these My little ones, ye have done to Me.” But at the same time let the sick themselves have in mind that it is for God’s honour they are served and so let them not with unnecessary demands weary their brethren who serve them.

Yet they must be patiently borne with, because from such is acquired more abundant merit. Therefore let the abbot take very great care that they suffer no neglect. And for these sick brethren let a cell be set apart; and as servitor one who fears God and is diligent and solicitous. Let the use of baths be allowed the sick as often as is expedient; but to those in good health and especially to the young let it be conceded less readily. Moreover, let the eating of flesh meat be conceded to the sick and especially to those who are weak, for their recuperation; but when they shall have got better let them all abstain from flesh meat as usual. And let the abbot take the greatest care that the sick be not neglected by the cellarers and the servitors; for he is responsible for anything his disciples do amiss.
