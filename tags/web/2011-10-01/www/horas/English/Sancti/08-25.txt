[Oratio]
O God, Who didst give unto thy blessed Confessor Lewis a glorious change from an~
earthly kingdom unto an heavenly, grant unto us, we beseech thee, for his sake~
and by his prayers, one day to enter like him into the Presence of the King of~
kings, even thy Son Jesus Christ
$Qui tecum

Lewis IX., King of France, (was born on the 25 th day of April, in the year of~
our Lord 1215.) At the age of twelve years he lost his father. He was brought~
up under the godly care of his mother, Blanche of Castile. In the twentieth year~
of his reign he fell grievously sick, and the thought then occurred to him of~
delivering Jerusalem out of the hands of the Moslems. On his health being~
restored, he received a banner from the Bishop of Paris, and crossed the sea (to~
Egypt) with a very great army. In his first battle he put the Saracens to flight,~
but, a great number of the soldiers perishing by disease, he was himself~
conquered and taken prisoner.

[Lectio5]
The King afterwards entered into treaty with the Saracens, and he and his army~
departed in peace. He remained five years in the East, during which he redeemed~
great numbers of Christians from slavery among the unbelievers, and also brought~
many of the unbelievers themselves to believe in Christ. Moreover he rebuilt~
several cities of the Christians at his own cost. Meanwhile, his mother departed~
this life, whereby he was constrained to return home, where he gave himself up~
entirely to works of godliness.

[Lectio6]
He built many monasteries, and charitable institutions for the poor. By his~
alms he relieved the needy, and often visited the sick, for whom he not only~
provided at his own cost, but waited on them with his own hands with such things~
as they wanted. He wore a plain dress and constantly chastised his body with~
hair-cloth and fasting. (In the year 1270) he crossed the sea (to Tunis) to~
make war again upon the Saracens. His camp was pitched in sight of the enemy,~
but he was seized with pestilence, and died uttering the words I will come into~
thy house I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy Name. (Pss. v. 8~
cxxxvii. 2.) His body was afterwards carried to Paris, and it is kept and~
honoured in the famous Abbey Church of St Denys, but his head in the oratory~
called La Sainte Chapelle. He was renowned for miracles, and Pope Boniface VIII.~
enrolled his name among those of the Saints.

Louis IX, King of France, was brought up under the most holy care of his mother Blanche. To regain possession of Jerusalem, he crossed the sea with a great army and put the Saracens to flight in the first battle. But, when a great many of his soldiers had perished in the plague, he was defeated and taken captive. Upon conclusion of a treaty, he was set free. He redeemed many Christians in the East from enslavement to the barbarians, and also converted many infidels to the faith of Christ. Returning to France, he built many monasteries and hospitals for the poor. He helped the needy by his beneficence, and he often visited the sick and served them himself. He wore plain clothing and constantly afflicted his body by wearing a hair shirt and by fasting. When he had crossed the sea again to make war against the Saracens and had pitched camp within sight of them, he died of the plague, saying this prayer : I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy Name.
