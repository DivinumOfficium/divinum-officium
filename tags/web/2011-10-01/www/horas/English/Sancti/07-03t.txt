[Lectio4]
From the Sermons of Pope St Leo the Great.
!1st for the Birth-day of SS. Peter and Paul.
Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His Saints  and no cruelty~
can trample out that Religion which was founded in the mysterious Sacrifice of~
the Cross of Christ. Under persecution the Church waneth not, but waxeth. And~
the Lord's field is ever clothed with a nobler harvest, when the grains of His~
wheat abide not alone, but fall into the ground, and die, and bring forth fruit~
manifold, (John xii. 24.) What an increase hath sprung up from these two~
glorious grains of God's seed, is witnessed by the thousands of blessed martyrs~
who have rivalled the triumph of the Apostles, who gird this our city with their~
red and world famous armies, and have set upon her head a crown of many kingly~
jewels.

[Lectio5]
Up their united succour, dearly beloved brethren, which hath been given unto us~
by God as an example of patience and a confirmation of faith, will be the cause~
of our joy on the days of the commemoration of all the Saints, but amid all~
their glory, doth excel in glory the glory of their spiritual fathers, whom the~
grace of God exalted to such a pitch of eminence among all the members of the~
Church, that they seem as it were the two eyes of that body whereof Christ is~
the Head. The worthy deed and loyal courage of either of them are such as to~
baffle all power of man's speech worthily to express the same, nor need we draw~
any distinction between them. In their election they were peers, in their work~
fellows, and in their end equals.

[Lectio6]
But, as our own experience hath taught us, and that of our forefathers hath~
proved, we believe and trust that, amid all the toils whereby in this life we~
strive towards the obtaining of God's mercy, we shall ever be holpen by the~
prayers of these our special Patrons, and that when our own sins thrust us down,~
the good deeds of the Apostles may pull us up. Through our Lord Jesus Christ,~
Who, with the Father and the Holy Ghost, hath but one power, as He hath one~
Divine nature, for ever and ever. Amen.
