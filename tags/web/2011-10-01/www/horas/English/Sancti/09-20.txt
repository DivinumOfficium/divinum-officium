O God, who dost permit us to keep the birthday of thy holy Martyrs Eustache and~
his companions, grant that we may enjoy their fellowship in everlasting~
happiness
$Per Dominum

[Lectio4]
Eustache, whose name before his Baptism was Placidus was a Roman, alike~
well-known on account of his noble birth, his great earthly wealth, and his~
eminent distinction as a soldier. He gained, under the Emperor Trajan, the post~
of military commander. Once upon a time he was hunting, and following an~
extraordinarily large stag, when the beast stood still, and Eustace saw between~
his horns a tall and glorious figure of the Lord Christ hanging upon the Cross,~
whence came a voice bidding him to follow after life eternal. Thereupon Eustace~
and his wife Theopista, and their two little sons Agapitus and Theopistus,~
enlisted themselves as soldiers under the Great Captain, Christ.

[Lectio5]
In a little while he went back, according as the Lord had commanded him, to the~
place where he had seen the first vision, and there he heard from God how much~
he was to bear for His glory. It was not long after that he had great losses and~
became exceedingly poor, but he bore it very patiently. Then he was constrained~
to fly away privily, and on the journey was grievously afflicted in that, first,~
his wife and then his children were parted from him and carried he knew not~
whither. Under the weight of these sorrows he lay hid a long while in a far-off~
place, working as the steward of a land -owner, until the voice of God called~
him forth, and Trajan sought for him again to make him a captain in his army.

[Lectio6]
While he was with the army he found his wife and children once more, by an~
unexpected happiness, and re-entered the city (of Rome) as a conquering soldier~
amid the loud applause of all men, but thereupon, when he was commanded to offer~
sacrifices of thanksgiving for the victory to the gods that are no gods, he~
stoutly refused. They tried him in vain with divers cajoleries to make him deny~
Christ, but could not, and he and his wife and little ones were thrown to the~
lions. When these beasts would not touch them, the Emperor's fury was kindled,~
and he commanded them all to be shut up in the brazen image of a bull, which was~
heated with fire underneath. There they praised God until their testimony was~
ended, and they departed hence to be perfectly blessed for ever and ever, upon~
the 20th day of September. Their bodies were buried whole by the faithful, with~
deep reverence, and were afterwards honourably carried to a Church built in~
their name.

[Lectio Vigilia]
!Commemoration for the Eve of S. Matthaei.
Lesson from the Gospel of St Luke.
!Luke 5:27-32
At that time Jesus saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of~
custom; and He said unto him Follow me. And so on.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!Book v. Comment, on Luke v.
There is a mystery in this calling of the publican, whom He biddeth to follow~
Him, not so much by bodily steps as by change of heart. Hitherto Levi had been~
making greedy gains from merchandise, cruel riches at the cost of sailors' toils~
and dangers; but now, at the call of a word, he, who had been plundering other~
men's goods, leaveth his own. He leaveth that base station, and followeth hard~
after the Lord with all his heart. And Levi made Him a great feast in his own~
house. He that welcometh Christ into his home, feasteth upon the excellency of~
all pleasures.
