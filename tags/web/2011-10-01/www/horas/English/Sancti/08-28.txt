O God, Who didst make thy blessed witness Hermes strong to wrestle and~

[Lectio4]
Austin was born of honourable parents at Tagaste in Africa, (upon the 13th day~
of November, in the year of our Lord 354.) As a boy his great intellectual~
sharpness caused him to distance all his companions in learning. When he was~
living at Carthage as a young man, he fell into the heresy of the Manichaeans.~
He afterwards went to Rome, and was thence sent to Milan to teach Rhetorick. At~
Milan he often went to hear the sermons of Bishop Ambrose, by whose labours he~
was drawn to the Catholic Church, and by whom he was baptized (on Holy Saturday,~
387,) at the age of thirty-three. After his return to Africa, (in 388,) Valerius,~
the illustrious and saintly Bishop of Hippo, finding him to unite holiness of~
life, with Catholic profession, made him a Priest, (about the end of 390.) At~
this time he founded a sort of family of godly men, who lived and worshipped in~
common with him, and whom he earnestly formed upon the model of the Apostolic~
life and teaching. The Manichaean heresy flaming forth with violence, he began~
strongly to attack it, and confounded the archheretic Fortunatus.

[Lectio5]
Valerius, moved by the godly zeal of Austin, (in December 395,) joined him with~
himself as an assistant in his duties of Bishop (and dying in the year~
following, was succeeded by him.) He was lowly and pure in the highest degree.~
His furniture and dress were plain, and his food of the commonest sort, which he~
always seasoned when at table by either reading some religious book, or arguing~
upon some religious subject. His tenderness to the poor was such that, failing~
all other resources, he broke up the hallowed vessels to relieve their wants. It~
was his rule not to dwell or be very close friends with any woman, a rule which~
he did not relax even in the case of his sister and niece, for he was accustomed~
to say, that although no scandal could arise in the case of such near kinswomen,~
yet it might arise concerning the women friends who sought their company. He~
never ceased to preach the Word of God, until he was disabled by heavy sickness.~
He was always an hard follower after heretics, and by his words and his writings~
never suffered them to rest anywhere. In great measure, he purged Africa of the~
Manicheans, Donatists, Pelagians, and other heretics.

[Lectio6]
He wrote so much, and that with such godliness and understanding, that he is to~
be held among the very chiefest of them by whom the teachings of Christianity~
have been shown forth. He is one of the first of those whom later theologians~
have followed, in method, and in argument. He fell sick of a fever what time the~
Vandals were laying Africa waste, and when they were busy in the third month of~
besieging Hippo. When he understood that his departure from this present life~
was at hand, he caused the Psalms of David which most speak the language of~
repentance to be placed before him, and read them with tears, for he was wont to~
say that even if a man's conscience were to accuse him of no sin, he should not~
dare to leave this world except as a penitent. His senses remained vigorous to~
the last, and it was while rapt in prayer, in the presence of the brethren whom~
he had exhorted to love, godliness, and all goodness, that he departed for~
heaven, (upon the 28th of August, 430.) He lived 76 years, whereof he had been a~
Bishop nearly thirty six. His body was first carried to Sardinia, but Luitprand,~
King of the Lombards, afterwards bought it for a great price, and took it to~
Ticino, where it is honourably buried.

[Lectio94]
Augustine was born of good parents at Tagaste in Africa, and in a short time surpassed all his companions in learning. As a young man, when in Carthage, he fell into the Manichean heresy. Later he went to Rome and was sent from there to Milan to teach rhetoric. At Milan, he was persuaded by Monica, his most devout mother, to become a frequent listener to the Bishop Ambrose. Ambrose brought it about that Augustine was fired with a desire for the Catholic faith, and baptized him when he was thirty-three years old. Going back to Africa, Augustine led a life governed by religion and holiness, and was made priest by Valerius, Bishop of Hippo, renowned for his sanctity. At this same period, he founded a religious community with whom he lived, taking part in their life and worship while he trained them very carefully to the apostolic life and to learning. Moved by his devotion, Valerius made him his coadjutor bishop. He wrote many works remarkable for their devotion, subtlety and diffuseness, to combat heresies and throw light on Christian teaching. When the Vandals were laying Africa waste and Hippo had been besieged for three months, he was taken with a fever and went to the Lord in the seventy-sixth year of his age. His body was buried first in Sardinia and then in Pavia, where it is venerated with honour.
