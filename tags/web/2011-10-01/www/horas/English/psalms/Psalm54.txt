54:1 (Unto the end, in verses, understanding for David.)
54:2 Hear, O God, my prayer, and despise not my supplication:
54:3 Be attentive to me and hear me. I am grieved in my exercise; and am troubled,
54:4 At the voice of the enemy, and at the tribulation of the sinner. For they have cast iniquities upon me: and in wrath they were troublesome to me.
54:5 My heart is troubled within me: and the fear of death is fallen upon me.
54:6 Fear and trembling are come upon me: and darkness hath covered me.
54:7 And I said: Who will give me wings like a dove, and I will fly and be at rest?
54:8 Lo, I have gone far off flying away; and I abode in the wilderness.
54:9 I waited for him that hath saved me from pusillanimity of spirit, and a storm.
54:10 Cast down, O Lord, and divide their tongues; for I have seen iniquity and contradiction in the city.
54:11 Day and night shall iniquity surround it upon its walls: and in the midst thereof are labour,
54:12 And injustice. And usury and deceit have not departed from its streets.
54:13 For if my enemy had reviled me, I would verily have borne with it. And if he that hated me had spoken great things against me, I would perhaps have hidden my self from him.
54:14 But thou a man of one mind, my guide, and my familiar,
54:15 Who didst take sweetmeats together with me: in the house of God we walked with consent.
54:16 Let death come upon them, and let them go down alive into hell. For there is wickedness in their dwellings: in the midst of them.
54:17 But I have cried to God: and the Lord will save me.
54:18 Evening and morning, and at noon I will speak and declare: and he shall hear my voice.
54:19 He shall redeem my soul in peace from them that draw near to me: for among many they were with me.
54:20 God shall hear, and the Eternal shall humble them. For there is no change with them, and they have not feared God:
54:21 He hath stretched forth his hand to repay. They have defiled his covenant,
54:22 They are divided by the wrath of his countenance, and his heart hath drawn near. His words are smoother than oil, and the same are darts.
54:23 Cast thy care upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee: he shall not suffer the just to waver for ever.
54:24 But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction. Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee, O Lord.
