24:3 Neither let my enemies laugh at me: for none of them that wait on thee shall be confounded.
24:4 Let all them be confounded that act unjust things without cause. Shew, O Lord, thy ways to me, and teach me thy paths.
24:5 Direct me in thy truth, and teach me; for thou art God my Saviour; and on thee have I waited all the day long.
24:6 Remember, O Lord, thy bowels of compassion; and thy mercies that are from the beginning of the world.
24:7 The sins of my youth and my ignorances do not remember. According to thy mercy remember thou me: for thy goodness' sake, O Lord.
24:8 The Lord is sweet and righteous: therefore he will give a law to sinners in the way.
24:9 He will guide the mild in judgment: he will teach the meek his ways.
24:10 All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth, to them that seek after his covenant and his testimonies.
24:11 For thy name's sake, O Lord, thou wilt pardon my sin: for it is great.
24:12 Who is the man that feareth the Lord? He hath appointed him a law in the way he hath chosen.
24:13 His soul shall dwell in good things: and his seed shall inherit the land.
24:14 The Lord is a firmament to them that fear him: and his covenant shall be made manifest to them.
24:15 My eyes are ever towards the Lord: for he shall pluck my feet out of the snare.
24:16 Look thou upon me, and have mercy on me; for I am alone and poor.
24:17 The troubles of my heart are multiplied: deliver me from my necessities.
24:18 See my abjection and my labour; and forgive me all my sins.
24:19 Consider my enemies for they are multiplied, and have hated me with an unjust hatred.
24:20 Deep thou my soul, and deliver me: I shall not be ashamed, for I have hoped in thee.
24:21 The innocent and the upright have adhered to me: because I have waited on thee.
24:22 Deliver Israel, O God, from all his tribulations.
