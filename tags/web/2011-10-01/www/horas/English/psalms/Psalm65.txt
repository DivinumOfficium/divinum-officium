65:1 (Unto the end, a canticle of a psalm of the resurrection.) Shout with joy to God, all the earth,
65:2 Sing ye a psalm to his name; give glory to his praise.
65:3 Say unto God, How terrible are thy works, O Lord! in the multitude of thy strength thy enemies shall lie to thee.
65:4 Let all the earth adore thee, and sing to thee: let it sing a psalm to thy name.
65:5 Come and see the works of God; who is terrible in his counsels over the sons of men.
65:6 Who turneth the sea into dry land, in the river they shall pass on foot: there shall we rejoice in him.
65:7 Who by his power ruleth for ever: his eyes behold the nations; let not them that provoke him be exalted in themselves.
65:8 O bless our God, ye Gentiles: and make the voice of his praise to be heard.
65:9 Who hath set my soul to live: and hath not suffered my feet to be moved:
65:10 For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us by fire, as silver is tried.
65:11 Thou hast brought us into a net, thou hast laid afflictions on our back:
65:12 Thou hast set men over our heads. We have passed through fire and water, and thou hast brought us out into a refreshment.
65:13 I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows,
65:14 Which my lips have uttered, And my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble.
65:15 I will offer up to thee holocausts full of marrow, with burnt offerings of rams: I will offer to thee bullocks with goats.
65:16 Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will tell you what great things he hath done for my soul.
65:17 I cried to him with my mouth: and I extolled him with my tongue.
65:18 If I have looked at iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.
65:19 Therefore hath God heard me, and hath attended to the voice of my supplication.
65:20 Blessed be God, who hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.
