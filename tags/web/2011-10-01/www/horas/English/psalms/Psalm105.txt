105:1 Give glory to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
105:2 Who shall declare the powers of the Lord? who shall set forth all his praises?
105:3 Blessed are they that keep judgment, and do justice at all times.
105:4 Remember us, O Lord, in the favour of thy people: visit us with thy salvation.
105:5 That we may see the good of thy chosen, that we may rejoice in the joy of thy nation: that thou mayst be praised with thy inheritance.
105:6 We have sinned with our fathers: we have acted unjustly, we have wrought iniquity.
105:7 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt: they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies: And they provoked to wrath going up to the sea, even the Red Sea.
105:8 And he saved them for his own name's sake: that he might make his power known.
105:9 And he rebuked the Red Sea and it was dried up: and he led them through the depths, as in a wilderness.
105:10 And he saved them from the hand of them that hated them: and he redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
105:11 And the water covered them that afflicted them: there was not one of them left.
105:12 And they believed his words: and they sang his praises.
105:13 They had quickly done, they forgot his works: and they waited not for his counsel.
105:14 And they coveted their desire in the desert: and they tempted God in the place without water.
105:15 And he gave them their request: and sent fulness into their souls.
105:16 And they provoked Moses in the camp, Aaron the holy one of the Lord.
105:17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan: and covered the congregation of Abiron.
105:18 And a fire was kindled in their congregation: the flame burned the wicked.
105:19 They made also a calf in Horeb: and they adored the graven thing.
105:20 And they changed their glory into the likeness of a calf that eateth grass.
105:21 They forgot God, who saved them, who had done great things in Egypt,
105:22 Wondrous works in the land of Cham: terrible things in the Red Sea.
105:23 And he said that he would destroy them: had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach: To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.
105:24 And they set at nought the desirable land. They believed not his word,
105:25 And they murmured in their tents: they hearkened not to the voice of the Lord.
105:26 And he lifted up his hand over them: to overthrow them in the desert;
105:27 And to cast down their seed among the nations, and to scatter them in the countries.
105:28 They also were initiated to Beelphegor: and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
105:29 And they provoked him with their inventions: and destruction was multiplied among them.
105:30 Then Phinees stood up, and pacified him: and the slaughter ceased.
105:31 And it was reputed to him unto justice, to generation and generation for evermore.
105:32 They provoked him also at the waters of contradiction: and Moses was afflicted for their sakes:
105:33 Because they exasperated his spirit. And he distinguished with his lips.
105:34 They did not destroy the nations of which the Lord spoke unto them.
105:35 And they were mingled among the heathens, and learned their works:
105:36 And served their idols, and it became a stumblingblock to them.
105:37 And they sacrificed their sons, and their daughters to devils.
105:38 And they shed innocent blood: the blood of their sons and of their daughters which they sacrificed to the idols of Chanaan. And the land was polluted with blood,
105:39 And was defiled with their works: and they went aside after their own inventions.
105:40 And the Lord was exceedingly angry with his people: and he abhorred his inheritance.
105:41 And he delivered them into the hands of the nations: and they that hated them had dominion over them.
105:42 And their enemies afflicted them: and they were humbled under their hands:
105:43 Many times did he deliver them. But they provoked him with their counsel: and they were brought low by their iniquities.
105:44 And he saw when they were in tribulation: and he heard their prayer.
105:45 And he was mindful of his covenant: and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.
105:46 And he gave them unto mercies, in the sight of all those that had made them captives.
105:47 Save us, O Lord, our God: and gather us from among the nations: That we may give thanks to thy holy name, and may glory in thy praise.
105:48 Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say: So be it, so be it.
