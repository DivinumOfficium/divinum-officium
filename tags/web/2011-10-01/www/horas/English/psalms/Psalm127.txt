127:1 (A gradual canticle.) Blessed are all they that fear the Lord: that walk in his ways.
127:2 For thou shalt eat the labours of thy hands: blessed art thou, and it shall be well with thee.
127:3 Thy wife as a fruitful vine, on the sides of thy house. Thy children as olive plants, round about thy table.
127:4 Behold, thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord.
127:5 May the Lord bless thee out of Sion: and mayst thou see the good things of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.
127:6 And mayst thou see thy children's children, peace upon Israel.
