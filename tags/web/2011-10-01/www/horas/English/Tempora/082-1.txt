Lesson from the book of Ecclesiastes
!Eccl 2:1-4
1 I said in my heart: I will go, and abound with delights, and enjoy good things. And I saw that this also was vanity.
2 Laughter I counted error: and to mirth I said: Why art thou vainly deceived?
3 I thought in my heart, to withdraw my flesh from wine, that I might turn my mind to wisdom, and might avoid folly, till I might see what was profitable for the children of men: and what they ought to do under the sun, all the days of their life.
4 I made me great works, I built me houses, and planted vineyards,

!Eccl 2:7-9
7 I got me menservants, and maidservants, and had a great family: and herds of oxen, and great flocks of sheep, above all that were before me in Jerusalem:
8 I heaped together for myself silver and gold, and the wealth of kings, and provinces: I made me singing men, and singing women, and the delights of the sons of men, cups and vessels to serve to pour out wine:
9 And I surpassed in riches all that were before me in Jerusalem: my wisdom also remained with me.

!Eccl 2:10-11
10 And whatsoever my eyes desired, I refused them not: and I withheld not my heart from enjoying every pleasure, and delighting itself in the things which I had prepared: and esteemed this my portion, to make use of my own labour.
11 And when I turned myself to all the works which my hands had wrought, and to the labours wherein I had laboured in vain, I saw in all things vanity, and vexation of mind, and that nothing was lasting under the sun.
