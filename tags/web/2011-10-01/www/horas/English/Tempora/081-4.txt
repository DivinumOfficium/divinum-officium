Lesson from the book of Proverbs
!Prov 10:1-5
1 A wise son maketh the father glad: but a foolish son is the sorrow of his mother.
2 Treasures of wickedness shall profit nothing: but justice shall deliver from death.
3 The Lord will not afflict the soul of the just with famine, and he will disappoint the deceitful practices of the wicked.
4 The slothful hand hath wrought poverty: but the hand of the industrious getteth riches. He that trusteth to lies feedeth the winds: and the same runneth after birds that fly away.
5 He that gathered in the harvest is a wise son: but he that snorteth in the summer, is the son of confusion.

!Prov 10:11-16
11 The mouth of the just is a vein of life: and the mouth of the wicked covereth iniquity.
12 Hatred stirreth up strifes: and charity covereth all sins.
13 In the lips of the wise is wisdom found: and a rod on the back of him that wanteth sense.
14 Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the fool is next to confusion.
15 The substance of a rich man is the city of his strength: the fear of the poor is their poverty.
16 The work of the just is unto life: but the fruit of the wicked, unto sin.
