Lesson from the second book of Kings
!2 Kgs 4:1-4
1 Now a certain woman of the wives of the prophets cried to Eliseus, saying: thy servant my husband is dead, and thou knowest that thy servant was one that feared God, and behold the creditor is come to take away my two sons to serve him.
2 And Eliseus said to her: What wilt thou have me to do for thee? Tell me, what hast thou in thy house? And she answered: I thy handmaid have nothing in my house but a little oil, to anoint me.
3 And he said to her: Go, borrow of all thy neighbours empty vessels not a few.
4 And go in, and shut thy door, when thou art within, and thy sons: and pour out thereof into all those vessels: and when they are full take them away

5 So the woman went, and shut the door upon her, and upon her sons: they brought her the vessels, and she poured in.
6 And when the vessels were full, she said to her son: Bring me yet a vessel. And he answered: I have no more. And the oil stood.
7 And she came, and told the man of God. And he said: Go, sell the oil, and pay thy creditor: and thou and thy sons live of the rest.
8 And there was a day when Eliseus passed by Sunam: now there was a great woman there, who detained him to eat bread; and as he passed often that way, he turned into her house to eat bread.
9 And she said to her husband: I perceive that this is a holy man of God, who often passeth by us.
10 Let us therefore make him a little chamber, and put a little bed in it for him, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick, that when he cometh to us, he may abide there.

11 Now there was a certain day when he came and turned in to the chamber, and rested there.
12 And he said to Giezi his servant Call this Sunamitess. And when he had called her, and she stood before him,
13 He said to his servant: Say to her Behold thou hast diligently served us in all things, what wilt thou have me to do for thee? hast thou any business, and wilt thou that I speak to the king, or to the general of the army? And she answered: I dwell in the midst of my own people.
14 And he said: What will she then that I do for her? And Giezi said: Do not ask, for she hath no son, and her husband is old.
15 Then he bid him call her: And when she was called, and stood before the door.
16 He said to her: At this time, and this same hour, if life accompany, thou shalt have a son in thy womb. But she answered: Do not, I beseech thee, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie to thy handmaid.
17 And the woman conceived, and brought forth a son in the time, and at the same hour, that Eliseus had said
