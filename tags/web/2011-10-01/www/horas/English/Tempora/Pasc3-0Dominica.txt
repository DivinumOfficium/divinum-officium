Alleluja, * alleluja, alleluja.

[Capitulum Vespera]
!1 Pet 2:11
Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, to refrain yourselves~
from carnal desires which war against the soul,
_
!Hymnus
At the Lamb’s high feast we sing
Praise to our victorious King,
Who hath washed us in the tide
Flowing from His pierced side.
_
Praise we Him whose love divine
Gives the guests His Blood for wine,
Gives His Body for the feast,
Love the victim, love the priest.
_
Where the Paschal blood is poured,
Death’s dark Angel sheathes his sword;
Israel’s hosts triumphant go
Through the wave that drowns the foe.
_
Christ, the Lamb whose Blood was shed,
Paschal victim, Paschal bread;
With sincerity and love
Eat we manna from above.
_
Mighty Victim from the sky,
Powers of hell beneath Thee lie;
Death is conquered in the fight;
Thou hast brought us life and light.
_
Now Thy banner Thou dost wave;
Vanquished Satan and the grave;
Angels join His praise to tell—
See o’erthrown the prince of hell.
_
Paschal triumph, Paschal joy,
Only sin can this destroy;
From the death of sin set free,
Souls re-born, dear Lord, in Thee,
_
* Hymns of glory, songs of praise,
Father, unto Thee we raise;
Risen Lord, all praise to Thee,
Ever with the Spirit be,

[Versum 1]
V. O Lord stay with us, alleluja.
R. because it is towards evening, alleluja.

[Ant 1]
A little while * and you shall not see me; and again a little while, and you~
shall see me, and, because I go to the Father, alleluja, alleluja.

[Oratio 1]
Almighty God, Who showest to them that be in error the light of Thy truth,~
to the intent that they may return into the way of righteousness ; grant unto~
all them that are admitted into the fellowship of Christ's Religion, that they~
may eschew those things that are contrary to their profession, and follow all~
such things as are agreeable to the same.

Incipit liber Apocalypsis beati Joannis Apostoli.
!Rev 1:1-6
1 The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to make known to his~
servants the things which must shortly come to pass: and signified, sending by~
his angel to his servant John, 2 Who hath given testimony to the word of God,~
and the testimony of Jesus Christ, what things soever he hath seen.
3 Blessed is he, that readeth and heareth the words of this prophecy; and~
keepeth those things which are written in it; for the time is at hand.
4 John to the seven churches which are in Asia. Grace be unto you and peace from~
him that is, and that was, and that is to come, and from the seven spirits which~
are before his throne,
5 And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the first begotten of the~
dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth, who hath loved us, and washed us~
from our sins in his own blood,
6 And hath made us a kingdom, and priests to God and his Father, to him be glory~
and empire for ever and ever. Amen.
_
R. Thou art worthy, O Lord, to take the book, and to open the seals thereof;~
alleluja: because thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God,
* In thy blood, alleluja
V. And hast made us to our God a kingdom and priests
R. in thy blood, alleluja

[Lectio2]
!Rev 1:7-11
7 Behold, he cometh with the clouds, and every eye shall see him, and they also~
that pierced him. And all the tribes of the earth shall bewail themselves~
because of him. Even so. Amen.
8 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, saith the Lord God, who is,~
and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.
9 I John, your brother and your partner in tribulation, and in the kingdom, and~
patience in Christ Jesus, was in the island, which is called Patmos, for the~
word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus.
10 I was in the spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as~
of a trumpet,
11 Saying: What thou seest, write in a book, and send to the seven churches~
which are in Asia, to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamus, and to Thyatira,~
and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.
_

R. Come over to me, all ye that desire me, and be filled with my fruits,~

[Lectio3]
!Rev 1:12-19
12 And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. And being turned, I saw~
seven golden candlesticks:
13 And in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks, one like to the Son of man,~
clothed with a garment down to the feet, and girt about the paps with a golden~
girdle.
14 And his head and his hairs were white, as white wool, and as snow, and his~
eyes were as a flame of fire,
15 And his feet like unto fine brass, as in a burning furnace. And his voice as~
the sound of many waters.
16 And he had in his right hand seven stars. And from his mouth came out a sharp~
two edged sword: and his face was as the sun shineth in his power.
17 And when I had seen him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right~
hand upon me, saying: Fear not. I am the First and the Last,
18 And alive, and was dead, and behold I am living for ever and ever, and have~
the keys of death and of hell.
19 Write therefore the things which thou hast seen, and which are, and which~
must be done hereafter.
_
R. and I heard a voice from heaven, the voice of great thunder, alleluja: the~
Lord our God shall reign for ever, alleluja:
* Now is come salvation, and strength, and the power of his Christ,alleluja,~
alleluja.
V. And a voice came out from the throne, saying: Give praise to our God, all~
saints of Him that fear him, little and great.
R. Now is come salvation, and strength, and the power of his Christ,alleluja,~
alleluja.
&Gloria
R. Now is come salvation, and strength, and the power of his Christ,alleluja,~
alleluja.

Sermo sancti Augustini Episcopi.
!Sermo 147. de Tempore.
Diebus his sanctis resurrectioni Domini dedicatis, quantum donante ipso possumus,~
de carnis resurrectione tractemus. Haec enim est fides nostra: hoc donum in~
Domini nostri Jesu Christi nobis carne promissum est, et in ipso praecessit~
exemplum. Voluit enim nobis, quod promisit in fine, non solum praenuntiare, sed~
etiam demonstrare. Illi quidem qui tunc fuerunt, cum illum viderent, et cum~
expavescerent, et spiritum se videre crederent, soliditatem corporis tenuerunt.~
Locutus est enim non solum verbis ad aures e5rum, sed etiam specie ad oculos~
eorum: parumque erat se praebere cernendum, nisi etiam offerret pertractandum,~
atque palpandum.
_
R. Locutus est ad me unus ex septem Angelis, dicens: Veni, ostendam tibi novam~
nuptam, sponsam Agni:
* Et vidi Jerusalem descendentem de coelo, ornatam monilibus suis, alleluja,~
alleluja, alleluja.
V. Et sustulit me in spiritu in montem magnum et altum.
R. Et vidi Jerusalem descendentem de coelo, ornatam monilibus suis, alleluja,~
alleluja, alleluja.

[Lectio5]
Ait enim: Quid turbati estis, et . cogitationes ascendunt in cor
vestrum? Putaverunt enim se spiritum videre. Quid turbati estis, inquit, et~
cogitationes ascendunt in cor vestrum? Videte manus meas, et pedes meos: palpate,
et
videte: quia spiritus ossa et carnem non habet, sicut me videtis habere. Contra~
istam evidentiam disputabant homines. Quid enim aliud facerent homines, qui ea,~
quae sunt hominum, sapiunt, quam sic disputare de Deo contra Deum? Ille enim~
Deus est, isti homines sunt. Sed Deus novit cogitationes hominum, quoniam vanae~
sunt.
_
R. Audivi vocem in coelo Angelorum multorum dicentium:
* Timete Dominum, et date claritatem illi, et adorate eum qui fecit coelum et~
terram, mare et fontes aquarum, alleluja, alleluja.
V. Vidi Angelum Dei fortem, volantem per medium coeli, voce magna clamantem et~
dicentem.
R. Timete Dominum, et date claritatem illi, et adorate eum qui fecit coelum et~
terram, mare et fontes aquarum, alleluja, alleluja.

[Lectio6]
In homine carndli tota regula intelligendi est consuetudo cernendi. Quod solent
videre, credunt: quod non solent, non credunt. Praeter consuetudinem facit Deus~
miracula, quia Deus est. Majora quidem miracula sunt, tot quotidie homines nasci,~
qui non erant, quam paucos resurrexisse, qui erant: et tamen ista miracula non~
consideratione comprehensa sunt, sed assiduitate viluerunt. Resurrexit Christus:~
absoluta est res. Corpus erat, caro erat: pependit in cruce, emisit animam,~
posita est caro in sepulchro. Exhibuit illam vivam, qui vivebat in illa. Quare~
miramur? quare non credimus? Deus est, qui fecit.
_
R. Veniens a Libano quam pulchra facta est, alleluja:
* Et odor vestimentorum ejus super omnia aromata, alleluja, alleluja.
V. Favus distillans labia ejus, mel et lac sub lingua ejus.
R. Et odor vestimentorum ejus super omnia aromata, alleluja, alleluja.
&Gloria
R. Et odor vestimentorum ejus super omnia aromata, alleluja, alleluja.

Lectio sancti Evangelii secundum Joannem.
!John 16:16-22
In illo tempore: Dixit Jesus discipulis suis: Modicum, et jam non
videbitis me: et iterum modicum, et videbitis me : quia vado ad Patrem. Et~
reliqua.
_
Homilia sancti Augustini Episcopi.
!Tr 101 in Johann sub fine
Modicum est hoc totum spatium, quo praesens pervolat saeculum. Unde dicit idem~
ipse Evangelista in Epistola sua: Novissima hora est. Ideo namque addidit: Quia
vado ad Patrem: quod ad priorem sententiam referendum est, ubi ait: Modicum, et~
jam non videbitis me: non ad posteriorem, ubi ait: Et iterum modicum, et
videbitis me. Eundo quippe ad Patrem, facturus erat ut eum non viderent. Ac per~
hoc non ideo dictum est, quia fuerat moriturus, et donec resurgeret, ab edrum~
aspectibus recessurus: sed quod esset iturus ad Patrem, quod fecit posteaquam~
resurrexit, et, cum eis per quadraginta dies conversatus, ascendit in coelum.
_
R. Decantabat populus Israel, alleluja: et universa multitudo Jacob canebat~
legitime:
* Et David cum cantoribus citharam percutiebat in domo Domini, et laudes Deo~
canebat, alleluja, alleluja.
V. Sanctificati sunt ergo sacerdotes et levitse: et universus Israel deducebat~
arcam fdederis Domini in jubilo.
R. Et David cum cantoribus citharam percutiebat in domo Domini, et laudes Deo~
canebat, alleluja, alleluja.


[Lectio8]
IUis ergo ait: Modicum, et jam non videbitis me; qui eum corporaliter tunc
videbant: quia iturus erat ad Patrem, et eum deinceps mortalem visuri non erant,~
qualem, cum ista loqueretur, videbant. Quod vero addidit: Et iterum modicum, et
videbitis me: universae promisit Ecclesise, sicut universae promisit: Ecce ego
vobiscum sum usque ad consummationem sseculi. Non tardat Dominus promissum.~
Modicum, et videbimus eum: ubi jam nihil rogemus, nihil interrogemus, quia nihil~
desiderandum remanebit, nihil quaerendum latebit.
_
R. Tristitia vestra, alleluja,
* Convertetur in gaudium, alleluja, alleluja. v. Mundus autem gaudebit, vos vero~
contristabimini: sed tristitia vestra.
R. Convertetur in gaudium, alleluja, alleluja.
&Gloria
R. Convertetur in gaudium, alleluja, alleluja.

[Lectio9]
Hoc modicum longum nobis videtur, quoniam adhuc agitur: cum finitum fuerit, tunc~
sentiemus quam modicum fuerit. Non ergo sit gaudium nostrum quale habet mundus,~
de quo dictum est: Mundus autem gaudebit. Nec tamen in hujus desiderii~
parturitione sine gaudio tristes simus: sed, sicut ait Apostolus: Spe gaudentes:~
In tribulatione patientes: quia et ipsa parturiens, cui comparati sumus, plus~
gaudet de mox futura prole, quam tristis est de praesenti dolore. Sed hujus~
sermonis iste sit finis: habent enim quaestionem molestissimam, quae sequuntur:~
nec brevitate coarctanda sunt, ut possint commodius, si Dominus
voluerit, explicari.

[Capitulum Laudes]
!1 Pet 2:11
Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, to refrain yourselves~
from carnal desires which war against the soul,
_
!Hymnus
v. The morn had spread her crimson rays,
When rang the skies with shouts of praise;
Earth joined the joyful hymn to swell,
That brought despair to vanquished hell.
_
He comes victorious from the grave,
The Lord omnipotent to save,
And brings with Him to light of day
The Saints who long imprisoned lay.
_
Vain is the cavern’s three-fold ward —
The stone, the seal, the armed guard;
O death, no more thine arm we fear,
The Victor’s tomb is now thy bier.
_
Let hymns of joy to grief succeed,
We know that Christ is risen indeed;
We hear His white-robed Angel’s voice,
And in our risen Lord rejoice.
_
With Christ we died, with Christ we rose,
When at the font His name we chose;
Oh, let not sin our robes defile,
And turn to grief the Paschal smile.
_
* To God the Father let us sing,
To God the Son, our risen King,
And equally let us adore
The Spirit, God forevermore.
Amen.

[Versum 2]
V. Christe, in your resurrection , alleluja.
R. The haeven and the Earth cries with joy, alleluja.

[Ant 2]
A little while, and you shall not see me; and again a little while, and you~
shall see me, and, because I go to the Father, alleluja, alleluja.
