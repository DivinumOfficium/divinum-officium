MY JESUS, I believe that Thou art present in the Blessed Sacrament. 
I love Thee above all things and I desire Thee in my soul.
Since I cannot now receive Thee sacramentally, come at least spiritually into my heart. 
As though thou wert already there, I embrace Thee and unite myself wholly to Thee; 
permit not that I should ever be separated from Thee. Amen
