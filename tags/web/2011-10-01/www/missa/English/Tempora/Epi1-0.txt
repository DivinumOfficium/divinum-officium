Lesson
!Col 3:12-17
Brethren: Put on, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, a heart of mercy, kindness, humility, meekness, patience. Bear with one another and forgive one another, if anyone has a grievance against any other; even as the Lord has forgiven you, so also do you forgive. But above all these things have charity, which is the bond of perfection. And may the peace of Christ reign in your hearts; unto that peace, indeed, you were called in one body. Show yourselves thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you abundantly: in all wisdom teach and admonish one another by psalms, hymns and spiritual songs, singing in your hearts to God by His grace. Whatever you do in word or in work, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to God the Father through Jesus Christ our Lord.

[Evangelium]
Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to
!Luke 2:42-52
When Jesus was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the~
custom of the feast. And after they had fulfilled the days, when they were~
returning, the Boy Jesus remained in Jerusalem, and His parents did not know it.~
But thinking that He was in the caravan, they had come a day’s journey before it~
occurred to them to look for Him among their relatives and acquaintances. And~
not finding Him, they returned to Jerusalem in search of Him. And it came to~
pass after three days, that they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst~
of the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. And all who were~
listening to Him were amazed at His understanding and His answers. And when they~
saw Him, they were astonished. And His Mother said to Him, Son, why have You~
done so to us? Behold, in sorrow Your father and I have been seeking You. And He~
said to them, How is it that you sought Me? Did you not know that I must be~
about My Father’s business? And they did not understand the word that He spoke~
to them. And He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was subject to~
them; and His Mother kept all these things carefully in her heart. And Jesus~
advanced in wisdom and age and grace before God and men.
