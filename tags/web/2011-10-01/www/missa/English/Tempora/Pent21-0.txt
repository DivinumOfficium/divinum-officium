Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians
!Eph 6:10-17
Brethren: Be strengthened in the Lord and in the might of His power. Put on the armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the Principalities and the Powers, against the world rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness on high. Therefore, take up the armor of God, that you may be able to resist in the evil day, and stand in all things perfect. Stand, therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breast-plate of justice, and having your feet shod with the readiness of the Gospel of peace, in all things taking up the shield of faith, with which you may be able to quench all the fiery darts of the most wicked one. And take unto you the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit, that is, the word of God.

[Graduale]
!Ps 89:1-2
O Lord, You have been our refuge through all generations.
V. Before the mountains were begotten and the earth and the world were brought~
forth, from everlasting to everlasting You are God.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 18:23-35
At that time, Jesus spoke to His disciples this parable: The kingdom of heaven~
is likened to a king who desired to settle accounts with his servants. And when~
he had begun the settlement, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand~
talents. And as he had no means of paying, his master ordered him to be sold,~
with his wife and children and all that he had, and payment to be made. But the~
servant fell down and besought him, saying, ‘Have patience with me and I will~
pay you all!’ And moved with compassion, the master of that servant released him,~
and forgave him the debt. But as that servant went out, he met one of his~
fellow-servants who owed him a hundred denarii and he laid hold of him, and~
throttled him, saying, ‘Pay what you owe.’ His fellow-servant therefore fell~
down and began to entreat him, saying, ‘Have patience with me and I will pay you~
all.’ But he would not; but went away and cast him into prison until he should~
pay what was due. His fellow-servants therefore, seeing what had happened, were~
very much saddened, and they went and informed their master of what had taken~
place. Then his master called him, and said to him, ‘Wicked servant! I forgave~
you all the debt, because you entreated me. Should not you also have had pity on~
your fellow-servant, even as I had pity on you?’ And his master, being angry,~
handed him over to the torturers until he should pay all that was due to him. So~
also My heavenly Father will do to you, if you do not each forgive your brothers~
from your hearts.

[Offertorium]
!Job 1.1
There was a man in the land of Hus, whose name was Job, simple, and upright, and~
fearing God, whom Satan besought that he might tempt: and power was given him~
from the Lord over his possessions and his flesh; and he destroyed all his~
substance and his children, and wounded his flesh also with a grievous ulcer.

Graciously accept these sacrificial gifts, O Lord, with which You have willed us~
to find favor with You, and, by Your mighty love, restore salvation to us.

!Ps 118:81; 118:84; 118:86
My soul pines for Your salvation; I hope in Your word. When will You do judgment~
on my persecutors? The wicked persecuted me wrongfully; help me, O Lord my God!

[Postcommunio]
We who have eaten the food of eternal life beseech You, O Lord, that what we~
take by mouth, we may strive after with pure minds.
