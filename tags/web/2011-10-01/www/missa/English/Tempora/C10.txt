Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus
!Ecclus 24:14-16
Before all ages, in the beginning, He created me, and through all ages I shall not cease to be. In the holy Tent I ministered before Him, and in Sion I fixed my abode.

I have struck root among the glorious people, in the portion of my God, His heritage, and my abode is in the full assembly of Saints.
