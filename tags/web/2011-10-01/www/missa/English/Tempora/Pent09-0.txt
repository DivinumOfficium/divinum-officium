Lesson from the first letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians
!1 Cor. 10:6-13
Brethren: We should not lust after evil things even as they lusted. And do not become idolaters, even as some of them were, as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. Neither let us commit fornication, even as some of them committed fornication, and there fell in one day twenty-three thousand. Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them tempted, and perished by the serpents. Neither murmur, as some of them murmured, and perished at the hands of the destroyer. Now all these things happened to them as a type, and they were written for our correction, upon whom the final age of the world has come. Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall. May no temptation take hold of you but such as man is equal to. God is faithful and will not permit you to be tempted beyond your strength, but with the temptation will also give you a way out that you may be able to bear it.

[Graduale]
!Ps 8:2
O Lord, our Lord, how glorious is Your name over all the earth!
V. You have elevated Your Majesty above the heavens. Alleluia, alleluia. 
!Ps 58:2
V. Rescue me from my enemies, O my God; from my adversaries defend me. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 19:41-47
At that time, when Jesus drew near to Jerusalem and saw the city, He wept over~
it, saying, If you had known, in this your day, even you, the things that are~
for your peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes. For days will come upon~
you when your enemies will throw up a rampart about you, and surround you and~
shut you in on every side, and will dash you to the ground and your children~
within you, and will not leave in you one stone upon another, because you have~
not known the time of your visitation. And He entered the temple, and began to~
cast out those who were selling and buying in it, saying to them, It is written,~
‘My house is a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a den of thieves. And He~
was teaching daily in the temple.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 18:9-12
The precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart, and His ordinances~
sweeter than syrup or honey from the comb; therefore Your servant is careful of~
them.

[Secreta]
Grant us, we beseech You, O Lord, to take part worthily and frequently in this~
sacramental action: for as often as this sacrifice of commemoration is offered,~
the work of our redemption is performed.

!John 6:57
He who eats My Flesh, and drinks My Blood, abides in Me, and I in him, says the~
Lord.

[Postcommunio]

unite us.
