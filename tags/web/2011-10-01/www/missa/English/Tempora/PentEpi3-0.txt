[Lectio]
Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Romans
!Rom 12:16-21
Brethren: Be not wise in your own conceits. To no man render evil for evil, but provide good things not only in the sight of God, but also in the sight of all men. If it be possible, as far as in you lies, be at peace with all men. Do not avenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to the wrath, for it is written, Vengeance is Mine: I will repay, says the Lord. But, If your enemy is hungry, give him food; if he is thirsty, give him drink; for by so doing you will heap coals of fire upon his head. Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 8:1-13
At that time, when Jesus had come down from the mountain, great crowds followed~
Him. And behold, a leper came up and worshipped Him, saying, Lord, if You will,~
You can make me clean. And stretching forth His hand Jesus touched him, saying, I~
will; be made clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. And Jesus said to~
him, See that you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer~
the gift that Moses commanded, for a witness to them. Now when He had entered~
Capharnaum, there came to Him a centurion who entreated Him, saying, Lord, my~
servant is lying sick in the house, paralyzed, and is grievously afflicted.~
Jesus said to him, I will come and cure him. But in answer the centurion said,~
Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof; but only say the word,~
and my servant will be healed. For I too am a man subject to authority, and have~
soldiers subject to me; and I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another,~
‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it. And when~
Jesus heard this, He marveled, and said to those who were following Him, Amen I~
say to you, I have not found such great faith in Israel. And I tell you that~
many will come from the east and from the west, and will feast with Abraham and~
Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom will be put forth into the darkness outside;~
there will be the weeping, and the gnashing of teeth. Then Jesus said to the~
centurion, Go your way; as you have believed, so be it done to you. And the~
servant was healed in that hour.

[Offertorium]

Out of the depths I cry to You, O Lord: Lord, hear my prayer! Out of the depths I~
