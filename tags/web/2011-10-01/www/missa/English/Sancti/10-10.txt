Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus
!Ecclus 45:1-6
Beloved of God and men, whose memory is held in benediction. He made him like the Saints in glory, and magnified him in the fear of his enemies, and with his words He made prodigies to cease. He glorified him in the sight of kings, and gave him Commandments in the sight of his people, and revealed to him His glory. He sanctified him in his faith and meekness, and chose him out of all flesh. For He heard him and his voice, and brought him into a cloud. And, face to face, He gave him the Commandments, the law of life and understanding.

!Ps 91:13
V. The just man shall flourish like the palm tree, like a cedar of Lebanon shall~

have followed Me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man shall sit on the~
throne of His glory, shall also sit on the throne of His glory, shall also sit~
on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And everyone who has~
left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children,~
or lands, for My name’s sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall possess~
life everlasting.
