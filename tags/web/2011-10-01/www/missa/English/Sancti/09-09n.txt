Lesson from the book of Isaias
!Isa 58:6-10
Thus says the Lord: Release those bound unjustly, untie the thongs of the yoke; set free the oppressed, break every yoke; share your bread with the hungry, shelter the oppressed and the homeless; clothe the naked when you see them, and do not turn your back on your own. Then your light shall break forth like the dawn, and your wound shall quickly be healed; your vindication shall go before you, and the glory of the Lord shall be your rear guard. Then you shall call, and the Lord will answer, you shall cry for help, and He will say: ‘Here I am!’ If you bestow your bread on the hungry and satisfy the afflicted; then light shall rise for you in darkness, and the gloom shall become for you like midday.

[Graduale]
!Ps 71:12-14
He shall rescue the poor man from the mighty, and the afflicted when he has no~
one to help him. He shall have pity for the lowly and the poor; the lives of the~
poor he shall save.
V. From fraud and violence he shall redeem them, and precious shall their names~
be in his sight. Alleluia, alleluia.
!Ps 9:33; 9:35
V. Rise, O Lord! O God, lift up Your hand! Forget not the afflicted! On You the~
unfortunate man depends; of the fatherless You are the helper. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 10:29-37
 At that time, a certain lawyer, wishing to justify himself, said to Jesus, And~
who is my neighbor? Jesus answered, A certain man was going down from Jerusalem~
to Jericho, and he fell in with robbers, who after both stripping him and~
beating him went their way, leaving him half-dead. But, as it happened, a~
certain priest was going down the same way, and when he saw him, he passed by.~
And likewise a Levite also, when he was near the place and saw him, passed by.~
But a certain Samaritan as he journeyed came upon him, and seeing him, was moved~
with compassion. And he went up to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil~
and wine. And setting him on his own beast, he brought him to an inn and took~
care of him. And the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the~
innkeeper and said, ‘Take care of him; and whatever more you spend, I, on my way~
back, will repay you.’ Which of these three, in your opinion, proved himself~
neighbor to him who fell among the robbers? And he said, He who took pity on~
him. And Jesus said to him, Go and do also in like manner.

[Offertorium]
!Job 29:12-13, 15-16.
Because I rescued the poor who cried out for help, the orphans, and the~
unassisted, the blessing of those in extremity came upon me, and the heart of~
the widow I made joyful. I was eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame was I; I~
was a father to the needy.
