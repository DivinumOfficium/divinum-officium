[Lectio]
Lesson from the first letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians
!1 Cor. 12:27-31
Brethren: You are the body of Christ, member for member. And God indeed has placed some in the Church, first Apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers; after that miracles, then gifts of healing, services of help, power of administration, and the speaking of various tongues. Are all Apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all workers of miracles? Do all have the gift of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret? Yet strive after the greater gifts.

[Graduale]
!Ps 44:17-18
You shall make them princes through all the land; they shall remember Your name, O~
Lord.
V. The place of your fathers your sons shall have; therefore shall nations~
praise You. Alleluia, alleluia.
V. The glorious choir of the Apostles praises You, O Lord. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 6:12-19
At that time, Jesus went out to the mountain to pray, and continued all night in~
prayer to God. And when day broke, He summoned His disciples; and from these He~
chose twelve - whom He also named Apostles-  Simon, whom He named Peter, and his~
brother Andrew; James and John; Philip and Bartholomew; Matthew and Thomas;~
James the son of Alpheus, and Simon called the Zealot; Jude the brother of James,~
and Judas Iscariot, who turned traitor. And coming down with them, He took His~
stand on a level stretch, with a crowd of His disciples, and a great multitude~
of people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who~
came to listen to Him and to be healed of their diseases. And those who were~
troubled with unclean spirits were cured. And all the crowd were trying to touch~
Him, for power went forth from Him and healed all.
