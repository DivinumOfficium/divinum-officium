Lesson from the book of Wisdom
!Wis 3:1-8
The souls of the just are in the hand of God, and no torment of death shall touch them. They seemed, in the view of the foolish, to be dead; and their passing away was judged an affliction, and their going forth from us, utter destruction. But they are in peace. For if before men, indeed, they be punished, yet is their hope full of immortality; chastised a little, they shall be greatly blessed, because God tried them and found them worthy of Himself. As gold in the furnace, He proved them, and as sacrificial offerings He took them to Himself. In the time of their visitation they shall shine, and shall dart about as sparks through stubble; they shall judge nations and rule over peoples, and the Lord shall be their King forever.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 21:9-19
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples, When you hear of wars and~
insurrections, do not be terrified; these things must first come to pass, but~
the end will not be at once. Then He said to them, Nation will rise against~
nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be great earthquakes in~
various places, and pestilences and famines, and there will be terrors and great~
signs from heaven. But before all these things they will arrest you and~
persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, dragging you~
before kings and governors for My name’s sake. It shall lead to your bearing~
witness. Resolve therefore in your hearts not to meditate beforehand how you are~
to make your defense. For I Myself will give you utterance and wisdom, which~
all your adversaries will not be able to resist or gainsay. But you will be~
delivered up by your parents and brothers and relatives and friends; and some of~
you they will put to death. And you will be hated by all for My name’s sake; yet~
not a hair of your head shall perish. By your patience you will win your souls.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 67:36
God is wonderful in His saints; the God of Israel is He Who gives power and~
strength to His people. Blessed be God! Alleluia.
