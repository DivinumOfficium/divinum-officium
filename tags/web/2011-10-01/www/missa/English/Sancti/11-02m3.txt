[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 6:51-55
At that time, Jesus said to the multitudes of the Jews, I am the living bread~
that has come down from heaven. If anyone eat of this bread he shall live~
forever; and the bread that I will give is My Flesh for the life of the world.~
The Jews on that account argued with one another, saying, How can this man give~
us His Flesh to eat? Jesus therefore said to them, Amen, amen, I say to you,~
unless you eat the Flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His Blood, you shall not~
have life in you. He who eats My Flesh and drinks My Blood has life everlasting~
and I will raise him up on the last day.

[Offertorium]
!  
O Lord, Jesus Christ, King of glory, deliver the souls of all the faithful~
departed from the pains of hell and the deep pit; deliver them from the lion’s~
mouth, that hell engulf them not, nor they fall into darkness, but that Michael,~
the holy standard-bearer, bring them into the holy light
v. which You once promised to Abraham and his seed.
V. We offer You, O Lord, sacrifices and prayers of praise; accept them for those~
souls whom we this day commemorate; grant them, O Lord, to pass from death to~
the life
v. which You once promised to Abraham and his seed.

[Secreta]
O God, Whose mercy is boundless, graciously accept our humble prayers, and,~
through this sacrament of salvation, grant to the souls of all the faithful~
departed, to whom You gave the grace of believing in You, the remission of all~
their sins.

Grant, we beseech You, O almighty and merciful God, that the souls of Your~

Majesty, cleansed of all sins by the virtue of this sacrament, may, by Your~
mercy, receive the joy of perpetual light.
