Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Philippians
!Phil 3:7-12
Brethren: The things that were gain to me, these, for the sake of Christ, I have counted loss. Nay more, I count everything loss because of the excelling knowledge of Jesus Christ, my Lord. For His sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and I count them as dung that I may gain Christ and be found in Him, not having a justice of my own, which is from the Law, but that which is form faith in Christ, the justice from God based upon faith; so that I may know Him and the power of His Resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings: become like to Him in death, in the hope that somehow I may attain to the resurrection from the dead. Not that I have already obtained this, or already have been made perfect, but I press on hoping that I may lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus has laid hold of me.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 12:32-34
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples, Do not be afraid, little flock, for~
it has pleased your Father to give you the kingdom. Sell what you have and give~
alms. Make for yourselves purses that do not grow old, a treasure unfailing in~
heaven, where neither thief draws near nor moth destroys. For where your~
treasure is, there also will your heart be.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 20:2-3
O Lord, in Your strength the just man is glad; in Your victory how greatly he~
rejoices! You have granted him his heart’s desire.

[Secreta]
Grant us, we beseech You, almighty God, that the offering of our lowliness may~
be pleasing to You in honor of Your Saints and may purify us in both body and~
mind.
