69:1 O God, come to my assistance; * O Lord, make haste to help me.
69:2 Let them be confounded and ashamed * that seek my soul:
69:3 Let them be turned backward, and blush for shame * that desire evils to me:
69:4 Let them be presently turned away blushing for shame * that say to me: ’T is well, ’t is well.
69:5 Let all that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee; * and let such as love thy salvation say always: The Lord be magnified.
69:6 But I am needy and poor; * O God, help me.
69:7 Thou art my helper and my deliverer: * O Lord, make no delay.
