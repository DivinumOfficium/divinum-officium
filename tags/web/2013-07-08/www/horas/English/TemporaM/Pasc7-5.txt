Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 5:17-26
AT that time It came to pass on a certain day, as Jesus sat and taught, that~
there were Pharisees, and Doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of~
every town in Galilee, and Judaea and Jerusalem and the power of the Lord was~
present to heal them. And so on.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop of Milan.
!Bk. v. on Luke v.
And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy." The~
healing of this paralytic was not idle, nor its fruits limited to himself. The~
Lord healed him, or ever he could ask, not because of the entreaties of others,~
but for example's" sake. He gave a pattern to be followed, and sought not the~
intercession of prayer. In the presence of the Pharisees and doctors of the~
law, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem,~
many sick folk were healed, but among them is specially described the healing of~
this paralytic. First of all, as we have before said, every sick man ought to~
engage his friends to offer up prayers for his recovery, that so the tottering~
framework of this our life, and the distorted feet of our works, may be righted~
by the healing power of the word from heaven.

[Responsory1]
R. Ye have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you
* That ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain.~
Alleluia, Alleluia.
V. As My Father hath sent Me, even so send I you.
R. That ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain.~
Alleluia, Alleluia.

[Lectio2]
Here ought therefore to be advisers, who should rouse up the minds of the sick~
to higher things, since when the body becometh languid with sickness, the~
mind is apt to follow its example. With the help of such friends he can be~
brought and laid on the ground before the Feet of Jesus, and seem worthy of a~
glance from the Lord for the Lord looketh upon such as lie lowly before Him,~
"for He hath regarded the lowliness of His handmaiden " (Luke ii. 48.) " And~
when He saw their faith, He said unto him Man, thy sins are forgiven thee."~
Great is the Lord, Who, for the sake of some, forgiveth the sins of others~
Who trieth some, and pardoneth the wanderings of others. Why should thine equal, O~
man, avail not with thee, if a slave have won power to intercede, and right to~
obtain, with God

[Responsory2]
R. The Spirit of the Lord filleth the world,
* And That Which containeth all things hath knowledge of the voice. Alleluia,~
Alleluia.
V. For [Wisdom] is the worker of all things, having all power, overseeing all things.
R. And That Which containeth all things hath knowledge of the voice. Alleluia, Alleluia.
&Gloria
R. And That Which containeth all things hath knowledge of the voice. Alleluia, Alleluia.

[Lectio3]
O Thou that judgest, learn to forgive thou that art sick, to pray. If thou~
doubt of the pardon of thy sins, because of their grievousness, get thee to the~
Church, that she may pray for thee, and that the Lord, accepting her countenance,~
may grant to her petitions what He refuses to thine. And although we are bound~
to accept this history as one of fact, and to believe that the body of the~
paralytic was healed yet remember thou also his inward cure, unto whom his~
sins were forgiven. The Jews said: "Who can forgive sins but God alone " And~
in these words they confessed the Godhead of Him Who forgave the sins of the~
paralytic, and themselves condemned their own unbelief in Him Whose work they~
acknowledged, but Whose Person they denied.

Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 5:17-26
5:17 And it came to pass on a certain day, as he sat teaching, that there were also Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, that were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judea and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was to heal them.
5:18 And behold, men brought in a bed a man, who had the palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him.
5:19 And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in, because of the multitude, they went up upon the roof, and let him down through the tiles with his bed into the midst before Jesus.
5:20 Whose faith when he saw, he said: Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.
5:21 And the scribes and Pharisees began to think, saying: Who is this who speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?
5:22 And when Jesus knew their thoughts, answering, he said to them: What is it you think in your hearts?
5:23 Which is easier to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say, Arise and walk?
5:24 But that you may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,) I say to thee, Arise, take up thy bed, and go into thy house.
5:25 And immediately rising up before them, he took up the bed on which he lay; and he went away to his own house, glorifying God.
5:26 And all were astonished; and they glorified God. And they were filled with fear, saying: We have seen wonderful things to day.
