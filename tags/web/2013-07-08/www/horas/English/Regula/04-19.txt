04-19# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 63: Concerning the Order of the Community. Continued.
_
Let therefore juniors by position honour those placed above them: let those placed above love their juniors. In the matter of addressing one another by name let it be lawful for no one to address another simply by name, but let those placed above designate their juniors “Fratres,” and juniors call those placed above them “Nonnos” which is understood as in paternal reverence: but let the abbot, because he is seen to represent Christ, be called “Domnus” and “Abbas,” not as having taken it upon himself, but for honour and love of Christ. But let him be mindful and so behave himself that he be worthy of such honour. And wherever the brethren meet one another, let the junior seek blessing from the one placed above him: and when a senior pass along, let the junior rise and give him room to sit and let not the junior presume to sit together with him unless the senior so direct him, so as to carry out what is written: “In honour preferring one another.” Let the younger and elder boys alike go to their places in the oratory or at table in an orderly manner. And out of doors or indeed anywhere at all let them have proper care and discipline until they reach the age of understanding.
