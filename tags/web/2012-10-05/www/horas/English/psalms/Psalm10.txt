10:1 (Unto the end. A psalm to David.)
10:2 In the Lord I put my trust: how then do you say to my soul: Get thee away from hence to the mountain, like a sparrow.
10:3 For, lo, the wicked have bent their bow: they have prepared their arrows in the quiver, to shoot in the dark the upright of heart.
10:4 For they have destroyed the things which thou hast made: but what has the just man done?
10:5 The Lord is in his holy temple, the Lord's throne is in heaven. His eyes look on the poor man: his eyelids examine the sons of men.
10:6 The Lord trieth the just and the wicked: but he that loveth iniquity, hateth his own soul.
10:7 He shall rain snares upon sinners: fire and brimstone, and storms of winds, shall be the portion of their cup.
10:8 For the Lord is just, and hath loved justice: his countenance hath beheld righteousness.
