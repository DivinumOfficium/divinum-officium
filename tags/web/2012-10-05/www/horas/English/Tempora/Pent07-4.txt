Lesson from the first book of Kings
!1 Kgs 4:21-24
21 And Solomon had under him all the kingdoms from the river to the land of the Philistines, even to the border of Egypt: and they brought him presents, and served him, all the days of his life.
22 And the provision of Solomon for each day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,
23 Ten fat oxen and twenty out of the pastures, and a hundred rams, besides venison of harts, roes, and buffles, and fatted fowls.
24 For he had all the country which was beyond the river, from Thaphsa to Gazan, and all the kings of those countries: and he had peace on every side round about.

!1 Kgs 4:25-29
25 And Juda and Israel dwelt without any fear, every one under his vine, and under his fig tree, from Dan to Bersabee, all the days of Solomon.
26 And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of chariot horses, and twelve thousand for the saddle. 27 And the foresaid governors of the king fed them: and they furnished the necessaries also for king Solomon's table, with great care in their time.
28 They brought barley also and straw for the horses, and beasts, to the place where the king was, according as it was appointed them.
29 And God gave to Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart as the sand that is on the sea shore.

!1 Kgs 4:30-34
30 And the wisdom of Solomon surpassed the wisdom of all the Orientals, and of the Egyptians,
31 And he was wiser than all men: wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Dorda the sons of Mahol, and he was renowned in all nations round about. 
32 Solomon also spoke three thousand parables: and his poems were a thousand and five. 
33 And he treated about trees from the cedar that is in Libanus, unto the hyssop that cometh out of the wall: and he discoursed of beasts, and of fowls, and of creeping things, and of fishes. 
34 And they came from all nations to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and from all the kings of the earth, who heard of his wisdom.
