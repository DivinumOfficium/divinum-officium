75:1 (Unto the end, in praises, a psalm for Asaph: a canticle to the Assyrians.)
75:2 In Judea God is known: his name is great in Israel.
75:3 And his place is in peace: and his abode in Sion:
75:4 There hath he broken the powers of bows, the shield, the sword, and the battle.
75:5 Thou enlightenest wonderfully from the everlasting hills.
75:6 All the foolish of heart were troubled. They have slept their sleep; and all the men of riches have found nothing in their hands.
75:7 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, they have all slumbered that mounted on horseback.
75:8 Thou art terrible, and who shall resist thee? from that time thy wrath.
75:9 Thou hast caused judgment to be heard from heaven: the earth trembled and was still,
75:10 When God arose in judgment, to save all the meek of the earth.
75:11 For the thought of man shall give praise to thee: and the remainders of the thought shall keep holiday to thee.
75:12 Vow ye, and pay to the Lord your God: all you that are round about him bring presents. To him that is terrible,
75:13 Even to him who taketh away the spirit of princes: to the terrible with the kings of the earth.
