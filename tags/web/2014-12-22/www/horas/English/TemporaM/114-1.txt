[Lectio1]
From the Prophet Oseas
!Osee 4:1-3
1  Hear the word of the Lord, ye children of Israel, for the Lord shall enter into judgment with the inhabitants of the land: for there is no truth, and there is no mercy, and there is no knowledge of God in the land.
2  Cursing, and lying, and killing, and theft, and adultery have overflowed, and blood hath touched blood.
3  Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth in it shall languish with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of the air: yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be gathered together.

!Osee 4:4-6
4  But yet let not any man judge: and let not a man be rebuked: for thy people are as they that contradict the priest.
5  And thou shalt fall to day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee: in the night I have made thy mother to be silent.
6  My people have been silent, because they had no knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will reject thee, that thou shalt not do the office of priesthood to me: and thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children.

!Osee 4:7-10
7  According to the multitude of them so have they sinned against me: I will change their glory into shame.
8  They shall eat the sins of my people, and shall lift up their souls to their iniquity.
9  And there shall be like people like priest: and I will visit their ways upon them, and I will repay them their devices.
10  And they shall eat and shall not be filled: they have committed fornication, and have not ceased: because they have forsaken the Lord in not observing his law.
