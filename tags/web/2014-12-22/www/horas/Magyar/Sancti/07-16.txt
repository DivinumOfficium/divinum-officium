[Oratio]
O Lord, Who hast given this excellency unto the Order of Carmel that the same~
should be especially styled the Order of the Most Blessed Mary, always a Virgin,~
thine Own Mother, mercifully grant that we who on this day do renew her memory~
in solemn worship, may worthily be shielded by her protection, and finally~
attain unto thine everlasting joy.

[Lectio4]
Here is a story to the effect that many men who had kept a tradition of the holy~
Prophets Elijah and Elisha, were made ready by the preaching of John the Baptist~
to hail the coming of the Messiah, and that, when the Apostles having been~
filled with the Spirit upon the holy day of Pentecost, spake with divers tongues~
and worked miracles by calling upon the Name of Jesus which is above every other~
name, these men, seeing and being assured of the truth, straightway embraced the~
faith of the Gospel, and that on account of their singular love toward the Most~
Blessed Virgin, whose conversation and friendship they were able to enjoy, they~
paid her the respect of building her a little Chapel, the first which was ever~
raised in honour of this same most pure Maiden, and which stood upon that part~
of Mount Carmel whence the servant of Elijah had in old days espied that~
manifest type of the Virgin, the little cloud like a man's hand, arising out of~
the sea. (3 Kings xviii. 44.)

[Lectio5]
Now this new Chapel they repaired oftentimes day by day, and in their sacred~
ceremonies, prayers, and praises, honoured the most blessed Virgin as the~
particular Guardian of their Congregation. For this reason they came to be~
everywhere called the Brethren of Blessed Mary, of Mount Carmel, and the Supreme~
Pontiffs have not only confirmed to them the right to use this name, but have~
granted particular indulgences to all those who so call either the Order itself,~
or any particular member thereof. Her name and protection are not the only gifts~
which the most bountiful Virgin hath given them yea, she hath given them the~
badge of the Holy Scapular, which she delivered to the Blessed Englishman Simon~
Stock, even an heavenly garment whereby this Holy Order is marked, and harnessed~
against all assaults. Moreover, in old times, when this Order was unknown in~
Europe, and not a few were instant with Honorius III. to put an end to it, the~
most gracious Virgin Mary appeared by night to the said Honorius, and flatly~
commanded him to show kindness to the Order and to the men belonging thereto.

[Lectio6]
Many godly persons believe that it is not in this world only that the most~
blessed Virgin hath marked with her favour this Order which pleaseth her so well,~
but that in the next world, where her power and mercy have a freer scope than~
here, they who belong to the Guild of the Scapular, who have practised an easy~
abstinence, have been regular in reciting a few prayers enjoined to them, and~
have kept chastity according to their state of life, are comforted by her~
motherly love while they are being cleansed in the fire of Purgatory, and by her~
help are borne forward towards their home in heaven more quickly than others.~
The Order loaded with so many and so great gifts, hath instituted a solemn~
Commemoration of the Most Blessed Virgin, to be made year after year, in~
perpetual observance, for the glory of the same Virgin.

[Ant 2]
Thine head upon thee * is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like kingly~
purple bound in tresses. Alleluja.

[Ant 3]
The glory of Lebanon * shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and~
Sharon. Alleluja.

[Lectio94]
On the holy day of Pentecost, it is said that many men, who were walking in the footsteps of the holy prophets Elias and Eliseus, embraced the faith of the Gospel, and began to build a chapel to that purest of Virgins on that very spot of Mount Carmel where Elias of old had seen a cloud arising, a remarkable symbol of the Virgin. Honouring this same most blessed Virgin as the special protectress of their Order, they were thenceforth called the brethren of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. The special protection of the most blessed Virgin hath never failed their Order, which Honorius III was dissuaded by a dream from abolishing, and to which she granted the badge of the holy scapular with the promise that those who are enrolled and observe the slight abstinence and say the few prayers prescribed, will be taken as soon as possible from the fire of Purgatory to the heavenly fatherland. Therefore the Order, laden with so many and such great favours, hath instituted a solemn Commemoration of the most blessed Virgin, to be celebrated year by year.

[Responsory7]
R. O Holy Virgin Mary, happy indeed art thou, and right worthy of all praise
* For out of thee rose the Sun of righteousness, even Christ our God.
V. Pray for the people, plead for the clergy, make intercession for all women~
vowed to God. May all that are keeping this thine solemn Commemoration feel the might~
of thine assistance.
R. For out of thee rose the Sun of righteousness, even Christ our God.
