[Ant 1]
O Lord, Thou hast hearkened unto the prayer of thy servant, * that I might build a~
temple unto thy Name.

[Versum 1]
V. Let the evening prayer ascend unto thee, O Lord.
R. And let there descend upon us thy mercy.

[Oratio]
Grant to us, Lord, we beseech I thee, the spirit to think and do always such~
things as be rightful, that we, who cannot do anything that is good without thee,~
may by thee be enabled to live according to thy will.
$Deo gratias

Olvasmány a Királyok első könyvéből
!1 Kgs 9:1-5
1 Amikor Salamon befejezte az Úr templomának és a királyi palotának az építését,~
és megvalósította minden más tervét is, amit csak akart s amihez csak kedve volt,
2 történt, hogy az Úr másodszor is megjelent Salamonnak, ahogy Gibeonban~
megjelent.
3 Így szólt hozzá az Úr: "Meghallgattam imádat és könyörgésedet, amellyel hozzám~
fordultál. Fölszenteltem ezt a templomot, amelyet építettél, s ott marad a nevem~
örökre; szemem és szívem is ott lesz mindig.
4 Ha színem előtt jársz, amint atyád, Dávid (színem előtt járt), tiszta szívvel~
és egyenes lelkülettel, mindent megteszel, amit kívánok tőled, teljesíted~
parancsaimat és törvényeimet,
5 akkor megerősítem királyi trónodat Izrael fölött örökre, amint atyádnak,~
Dávidnak ígértem, amikor azt mondtam: Sohasem leszel utód híjával Izrael~
trónján.

[Responsory1]
R. Prepare your hearts unto the Lord, and serve Him Only
* And He will deliver you out of the hand of your enemies.
V. Return unto Him with all your hearts, and put away the strange gods from~
among you.
R. And He will deliver you out of the hand of your enemies.

[Lectio2]
!1 Kgs 9:6-9
6 Ha azonban elfordultok tőlem, ti és gyermekeitek, és nem tartjátok meg~
parancsaimat és törvényeimet, amelyeket rendeltem nektek, hanem elmentek más~
isteneknek szolgálni és őket imádni,
7 akkor eltörlöm Izraelt arról a földről, amelyet adtam neki, s elpusztítom~
színem elől a templomot is, amelyet nevemnek szenteltem. Izrael szólásmondás és~
gúny tárgya lesz a népek körében.
8 És ez a fölséges templom - aki csak elmegy mellette, megdöbben és felszisszen~
ha megkérdezik, miért bánt így az Úr ezzel a földdel és ezzel a házzal,
9 akkor azt mondják majd: azért, mert elhagyták az Urat, az ő Istenüket, aki~
kivezette atyáikat Egyiptom földjéről, mert idegen istenekhez pártoltak, azokat~
imádták, nekik szolgáltak, azért hozta rájuk az Úr ezt a sok bajt."

[Responsory2]
R. God, Which heareth all, even He sent His Angel, and took me from keeping my~
father's sheep, and
* Anointed me with the oil of His mercy.
V. The Lord That delivered me out of the mouth of the lion, and out of the paw~
of the bear
R. And anointed me with the oil of His mercy.

[Lectio3]
!1 Kgs 9:10-14
10 A húsz esztendő elteltével - ezalatt készült el Salamon a két épületnek, az~
Úr templomának és a királyi palotának a fölépítésével -,
11 mivel Tírusz királya, Hirám annyi cédrus- és ciprusfával meg arannyal látta~
el, amennyit csak akart, Salamon király húsz várost Hirámnak adott Galilea~
vidékén.
12 Hirám eljött Tíruszból megtekinteni a városokat, amelyeket Salamon átengedett~
neki. De nem tetszettek neki.
13 Azt mondta: "Miféle városok ezek, amelyeket átengedsz nekem, testvér?" Azért~
hívják Kabulnak azt a vidéket mind a mai napig.
14 Mindazáltal Hirám küldött a királynak 120 arany talentumot.

[Responsory3]
R. The Lord That delivered me out of the mouth of the lion, and out of the paw~
of the bear
* He will deliver me out of the hand of mine enemies.
V. God hath sent forth His mercy and His truth, and delivered my soul from among~
the lion's whelps.
R. He will deliver me out of the hand of mine enemies.
&Gloria
R. He will deliver me out of the hand of mine enemies.

[Lectio4]
From the Book upon " The City of God " written by St Austin, Bishop of Hippo.
!Bk. xvii. ch. 8.
Things which were then still to come were in a certain manner imagined in~
Solomon, who built the temple, who had that peace which his name implieth (for~
the name Solomon signifieth " the Peaceful One ") and who, at the beginning of~
his reign, was marvellously praiseworthy. By these things he foreshadowed in his~
own person, though he set not forth with his mouth, our Lord Christ. Thus are~
some things written of Solomon which are, as it were, things written concerning~
Christ, the Holy Scripture in this way, by giving the history of things past,~
prophesying all the while of things to come.

[Responsory4]
R. Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.
* Because the hand of the Lord was with him, he smote the Philistine, and took~
away the reproach from Israel.
V. Is not this David? Did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying~
Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
R. Because the hand of the Lord was with him, he smote the Philistine, and took~
away the reproach from Israel.

[Lectio5]
Nor besides the books of the Divine history wherein his reign is recorded, the~
71st Psalm is superscribed with his name. In this Psalm are many things which~
cannot suit him, but are most clearly applicable to the Lord Christ, thus~
showing that Solomon was, as it were, a shadowy figure cast before, of that~
which was afterwards revealed in very truth in the Person of Christ.

[Responsory5]
R. Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain upon~
you
* For there are the mighty of Israel fallen
V. All ye mountains that stand round about, the Lord look upon you but let Him~
pass by Gilboa
R. For there are the mighty of Israel fallen

[Lectio6]
Without going into the rest, I may say that it is known what were the limits of~
Solomon's dominions, and yet in that Psalm we read " He shall have dominion also~
from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth." This we see~
fulfilled in Christ. It was from the river, that is, from His Baptism by John in~
Jordan, that He began His assumption of dominion, for then it was when John bare~
testimony unto Him that His disciples began to acknowledge Him, calling Him, not~
Master only, but Lord.

[Responsory6]
R. Thus saith the Lord I took thee out of thy father's house, and appointed thee~
to be ruler over My people, over Israel.
* And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, to establish thy kingdom for~
ever.
V. And I have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that~
are in the earth and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies.
R. And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, to establish thy kingdom for~
ever.
&Gloria
R. And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, to establish thy kingdom for~
ever.

Evangélium szent Lukács Evangélista kőnyvéből
!Luke 16:1-9
Azon időben Jézus ezt a példabeszédet mondá tanitványainak: Egy gazdag embernek~
volt egy intézője. Bevádolták nála, hogy eltékozolja vagyonát. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest at Bethlehem.
!Letter 151. To Algasia.
The lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely though~
wickedly. The lord, although himself defrauded by it, could not but praise the~
shrewdness of his dishonest servant, because he had cheated him with profit to~
himself. How much more will our Master Christ, Who is above any defrauding by us,~
and is Himself the Great Forgiver, praise us if we win a blessing from Him by~
dealing indulgently with those who are to believe in Him?

[Responsory7]
@Tempora/Pent01-3:Responsory1

[Lectio8]
After this parable the Lord saith Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of~
unrighteousness." This word "mammon" is a Syriac (not an Hebrew) word,~
signifying illgotten gains. If then even ill-gotten gains can be so used by such~
as have them as to profit them, how much more can they who, like the Apostles,~
are " stewards of the mysteries of God," those true and blameless riches, how~
much more can they profit themselves, (1 Cor. iv. 1,) even everlastingly, by~
their right use of them

[Responsory8]
@Tempora/Pent01-0:Responsory8

[Lectio9]
Therefore it is immediately written " He that is faithful in that which is least~
that is to say, in bodily things is faithful also in much that is to say, in~
spiritual things. "And he that is unjust in the least" that is to say, by not~
giving to his needy brother succour of those things which are needful for the~
body, and which God hath made for all men, such an one is unjust also in much~
that is to say, he will deal out spiritual things unfairly, this to one and that~
to another, and not according to their true spiritual needs. "If therefore,"~
saith the Lord, "ye have not been faithful in the " use of earthly riches which~
pass away, "who will commit to your trust the true and abiding riches," that is,~
the spiritual riches of the word of God
&teDeum

[Ant 2]
The lord said unto his steward * How is it that I hear this of thee Give an~
account of thy stewardship.

[Versum 2]
V. The Lord reigneth He is clothed with majesty.
R. The Lord is clothed with strength, and hath girded Himself with power.

[Ant 3]
What shall I do * For my lord taketh away from me the stewardship. I cannot dig~
to beg, I am ashamed. I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the~
stewardship, they may receive me into their houses. Alleluja.

[Versum 3]
V. Let my prayer, O Lord, be set forth.
R. As incense before thee.
