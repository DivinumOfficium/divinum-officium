Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus
!Ecclus 51:13-17
O Lord, my God, You have exalted my dwelling place upon the earth, and I have prayed for death to pass away. I called upon the Lord, the Father of my Lord, that He would not abandon me in the day of my trouble, and in the time of the proud without help. I will ever praise Your name, and will praise it with thanksgiving; and my prayer was heard. And You saved me from destruction, and delivered me from the evil time. For this reason I thank You and I praise You, O Lord, our God.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 13:44-52
At that time, Jesus spoke this parable to His disciples: The kingdom of heaven~
is like a treasure hidden in a field; he who finds it hides it, and in his joy~
goes and sells all that he has and buys that field. Again, the kingdom of heaven~
is like a merchant in search of fine pearls. When he finds a single pearl of~
great price, he goes and sells all that he has and buys it. Again, the kingdom~
of heaven is like a net cast into the sea that gathered in fish of every kind.~
When it was filled, they hauled it out, and sitting down on the beach, they~
gathered the good fish into vessels, but threw away the bad. So will it be at~
the end of the world. The angels will go out and separate the wicked from among~
the just, and will cast them into the furnace of fire, where there will be the~
weeping and the gnashing of teeth. Have you understood all these things? They~
said to Him, Yes. And He said to them, So then, every Scribe instructed in the~
kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings forth from his storeroom~
things new and old.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 44:3
Grace is poured out upon your lips; thus God has blessed you forever, and for~
ages of ages.

[Secreta]

!Ps 118:121, 122, 128.
I have fulfilled just ordinances, O Lord; let not the proud oppress me. For in~
all Your precepts I go forward; every false way I hate.

Lord our God, that through the intercession of blessed Bibiana, Your Virgin and~
Martyr, we may forevermore abide in its participation.
