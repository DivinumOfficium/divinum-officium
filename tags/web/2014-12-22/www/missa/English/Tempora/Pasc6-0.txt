[Lectio]
Lesson from the first letter of St Peter the Apostle
!1 Pet 4:7-11.
Beloved: Be prudent and watchful in prayers. But above all things have a constant mutual charity among yourselves: for charity covers a multitude of sins. Be hospitable to one another without murmuring. According to the gift that each has received, minister it to one another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. If anyone speaks, let it be as with words of God. If anyone ministers, let it be as from the strength that God furnishes; that in all things God may be honored through Jesus Christ our Lord.

your heart shall rejoice. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 15:26-27; 16:1-4.
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples: When the Advocate has come, Whom I~
will send you from the Father, the Spirit of truth Who proceeds from the Father,~
He will bear witness concerning Me. And you also will bear witness, because from~
the beginning you are with Me. These things I have spoken to you that you may~
not be scandalized. They will expel you from the synagogues. Yes, the hour is~
coming for everyone who kills you to think he is offering worship to God. And~
these things they will do because they have not known the Father nor Me. But~
these things I have spoken to you, that when the time for them has come you may~
remember that I told you.

[Offertorium]

God mounts His throne amid shouts of joy; the Lord, amid trumpet blasts.~

of heavenly grace.

continue giving thanks to You.
