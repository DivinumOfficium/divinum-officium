Lesson from the book of Isaias
!Isa 4:1-3
1 And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying: We will eat~
our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name, take~
away our reproach.
2 In that day the bud of the Lord shall be in magnificence and glory, and the~
fruit of the earth shall be high, and a great joy to them that shall have~
escaped of Israel.
3 And it shall come to pass, that every one that shall be left in Sion, and that~
shall remain in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, every one that is written in~
life in Jerusalem.

!Isa 5:1-4
1 I WILL sing to my beloved the canticle of my cousin concerning his vineyard.~
My beloved had a vineyard on a hill in a fruitful place.
2 And he fenced it in, and picked the stones out of it, and planted it with the~
choicest vines, and built a tower in the midst thereof, and set up a winepress~
therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth~
wild grapes.
3 And now, O ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and ye men of Juda, judge between me~
and my vineyard.
4 What is there that I ought to do more to my vineyard, that I have not done to~
it? was it that I looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it hath brought~
forth wild grapes?

!Isa 5:5-7
5 And now I will shew you what I will do to my vineyard. I will take away the~
hedge thereof, and it shall be wasted: I will break down the wall thereof, and~
it shall be trodden down.
6 And I will make it desolate: it shall not be pruned, and it shall not be~
digged: but briers and thorns shall come up: and I will command the clouds to~
rain no rain upon it.
7 For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel: and the man of~
Juda, his pleasant plant: and I looked that he should do judgment, and behold~
iniquity: and do justice, and behold a cry.
