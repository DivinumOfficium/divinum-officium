!Prov 31:10-17
10 Derék asszonyt ki talál? Értéke a gyöngyét messze meghaladja.
11 Férje (egész) szívével ráhagyatkozik, és nem jár rosszul vele.
12 Mindig a javára van, sose a kárára, életének minden napján.
13 Elõteremti a gyapjút és a kendert, és mindent beszerez, ügyes kézzel.
14 Olyan, mint a kalmárok hajója: messze földrõl szállítja az élelmet.
15 Bár még éjszaka van, már fölkel, és ellátja a háza népét eledellel, szolgálólányait egy egész napra valóval.
16 Szántóföld után néz és meg is szerzi, szõlõt telepít a keze munkájából.
17 Jól körülköti derekát az övével, és nekifeszíti karját a munkának.

[Responsory1]
R. Come, O My chosen one, and I will establish My throne in thee
* For the King hath greatly desired thy beauty.
V. In thy comeliness and thy beauty, go forward, fare prosperously, and reign.
R. For the King hath greatly desired thy beauty.

!Prov 31:18-24
18 Tudja, hogy jó hasznot hajt, éjnek idején sem alszik ki lámpája.
19 Kinyújtja a karját a guzsaly után, és a kezével megfogja az orsót.
20 Kiterjeszti kezét az elnyomott fölé, a szûkölködõnek meg a karját nyújtja.
21 Nem kell féltenie háza népét a hótól: egész háza népét ellátta kettõs ruhával,
22 és takarókat is csinált magának. Ruhája bársonyos len és bíbor gyapjú.
23 Férjét a kapuknál igen nagyra tartják, hogyha tanácsban ül az ország véneivel.
24 Ingeket is készít és eladja õket, öveket is árul a kereskedõnek.

27 Szemmel tartja háza népének munkáját, a tétlen lustaság nem kenyere.
28 Kiállnak fiai, s boldognak hirdetik, a férje is fölkel és így dicséri:
29 "Sok asszony megmutatta, milyen derék, de te felülmúlod õket, mind valamennyit!"
30 Csalfa dolog a báj, a szépség mulandó, de az okos asszonynak kijár a dicséret.
31 Magasztaljátok keze munkájáért, a városkapuknál dicsérjék tetteit!

From the Book upon Widows by St Ambrose, Bishop of Milan.
!near the end
Behold the field of the Church, that the same is a fruitful field, some while smiling with the brightness of virginity, somewhile golden with the ripe harvest of widowhood, somewhile rich with the crop of marriage. These things be diverse, but they be the fruits of the same field. There are not so many choice lilies as stalks of bearded grain, ears for the harvest, and there are more places in the soil fitted once to receive seed than there are places which, when they have yielded a crop, are fitted again to be ploughed. Good, then, is widowhood, which the judgment of an Apostle hath so often commended, widowhood, which is the teacher of faith and of purity.

[Responsory4]
R. Because of truth, and meekness, and righteousness
* And thy right hand shall lead thee wonderfully.
V. In thy comeliness and thy beauty, go forward, fare prosperously, and reign.
R. And thy right hand shall lead thee wonderfully.

[Lectio5]
Therefore they who worship adultery and uncleanness in their gods made celibacy and widowhood punishable. They who lusted after abominations, taxed self-control. The pretence was the desire of fruitfulness, but the aim was to abolish virginity, the resolution of chastity. When a soldier hath served his time he layeth down his arms, leaveth his trade, and retireth him to his own lands, that as well himself may rest after the toils of life, as that the hope of rest to come may make others the more ready to undergo work. So also the aged labourer leaveth it for others to guide the handle of the plough, and withdraweth from the weariness of his younger days' labour to essay the task of an old man's thoughtful supervision. It is easier to prune vines, than to stamp them out, to check the first wild outburst of their vigour, and to curtail the wantonness of their young growth, so teaching, even by the ensample of the vineyard, that chastity, which keepeth itself within the bearing of but a few children.

[Responsory5]
R. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity
* Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness.
V. Because of truth, and meekness, and righteousness.
R. Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness.

[Lectio6]
Luke to these is a widow, a veteran retiring to rest upon the earned rewards of her chastity, and who, albeit she layeth down the arms of wifehood, still ruleth the order of all her household albeit she be at rest from bearing burdens, she is careful in the marriage of her youngers, and with the wisdom of age chooseth what study is the most useful, what fruit is the richest, what wedlock is the meetest. And so, if the government of the field be given more to the elder than to the younger, wherefore shouldest thou hold that a wife is more useful than a widow? But if they which persecuted the faith persecuted also widowhood, then, surely, in the eyes of them which hold the faith, must widowhood be looked upon as a reward, rather than shrunk from as a punishment.

[Responsory6]
R. Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain
* A woman that feareth God she shall be praised.
V. Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her own works praise her in the gates.
R. A woman that feareth God she shall be praised.
&Gloria
R. A woman that feareth God she shall be praised.

Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kõnyvébõl
!Matt 13:44
Azon idõben így szólt Jézus tanitványaihoz: A mennyek országa hasonlít a szántóföldben elrejtett kincshez. És így tovább.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory the Great.
!11th on the Gospels?
Dearly beloved brethren, the kingdom of heaven is likened unto the things of earth, to the end that by the mean of things which we know, our mind may rise to the contemplation of the things which we know not by the ensample of things which are seen, may fix her gaze on things which are not seen by the touch of things which she useth, may be warmed towards the things which she useth not; by things which she knoweth and loveth, to love also the things which she knoweth not. For, behold, " the kingdom of heaven is likened unto treasure hid in a field, the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and, for joy thereof, goeth and selleth all that he hath and buyeth that field."

[Responsory7]
R. She openeth her mouth with wisdom, and in her tongue is the law of kindness. She looketh well to the ways of her household
* And eateth not the bread of idleness.
V. She tasteth and perceiveth that her merchandise is good. Her candle goeth not out by night.
R. And she eateth not the bread of idleness.

[Lectio8]
And herein we must remark that the treasure, when once it hath been found, is hidden to keep it safe. He who keepeth not hidden from the praises of men his eager striving heavenwards, doth not enough to keep the same safe from the attacks of evil spirits. In this life we are, as it were, on the way home, and the road is beset by evil spirits, as it were, by highwaymen. He, therefore, inviteth robbery who carrieth his treasure glaringly. This I say, not that our neighbour should not see our good works since it is written " Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father by what we do, to gain the praise of men. Let the outward work agree with the inward thought, that by our good works we may give an ensample to our neighbour, and still, by our intention, directed only to the pleasing God, we may also have liefer that our works were secret.

[Responsory8]
R. The kingdom of this world and all the beauty of life I have esteemed as nothing, for the excellency of the love of Jesus Christ my Lord
* Whom, having seen, I loved Whom, having believed, I longed after.
V. My heart is overflowing with a good matter I speak of my works unto the King.
R. Whom, having seen, I loved Whom, having believed, I longed after.
&Gloria
R. Whom, having seen, I loved Whom, having believed, I longed after.

[Lectio9]
The treasure is the desire for heaven the field wherein it is hidden is the earnest observance wherewith this desire is surrounded. Whosoever turneth his back upon the enjoyments of the flesh, and by earnest striving heavenward, putteth all earthly lusts under the feet of discipline, so that he smileth back no more when the flesh smileth at him, and shuddereth no more at anything that can only kill the body whosoever doth thus, hath sold all that he had, and bought that field.
