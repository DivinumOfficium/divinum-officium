Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus
!Ecclus 51:13-17
O Lord, my God, You have exalted my dwelling place upon the earth, and I have prayed for death to pass away. I called upon the Lord, the Father of my Lord, that He would not abandon me in the day of my trouble, and in the time of the proud without help. I will ever praise Your name, and will praise it with thanksgiving; and my prayer was heard. And You saved me from destruction, and delivered me from the evil time. For this reason I thank You and I praise You, O Lord, our God.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt. 25:1-13
At that time, Jesus spoke this parable to His disciples: Then will the kingdom~
of heaven be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went forth to meet the~
bridegroom and the bride. Five of them were foolish and five wise. But the five~
foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them, while the wise did~
take oil in their vessels with the lamps. Then as the bridegroom was long in~
coming, they all became drowsy and slept. And at midnight a cry arose and~
trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil,~
for our lamps are going out.’ The wise answered, saying, ‘Lest there may not be~
enough for us and for you, go rather to those who sell it, and buy some for~
yourselves.’ Now while they were gone to buy it, the bridegroom came; and those~
who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut.~
Finally there came also the other virgins, who said, ‘Sir, sir, open the door~
for us!’ But he answered and said, ‘Amen I say to you, I do not know you.’ Watch~
therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour.
