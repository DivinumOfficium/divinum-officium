Olvasmány szent Pál apostol Korintusiakhoz irott második levelébõl
!2 Cor 1:1-5
1 Pál, Isten akaratából Jézus Krisztus apostola és Timóteus testvér Isten~
korintusi egyházának és egész Achájában minden szentnek.
2 Kegyelem és békesség nektek Istentõl, Atyánktól és Urunktól, Jézus~
Krisztustól!
3 Áldott legyen az Isten, Urunk Jézus Krisztus Atyja, az irgalom Atyja és a~
minden vigasztalás Istene!
4 Õ megvigasztal minket minden szomorúságunkban, hogy mi is megvigasztalhassuk~
azokat, akik szomorúak, azt a vigasztalást nyújtva nekik, amelyet õ nyújt~
nekünk.
5 Amilyen bõven kijut nekünk Krisztus szenvedéseibõl, olyan bõven lesz részünk~
Krisztus révén a vigasztalásban is.

[Responsory1]
R. O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thine hot~
displeasure.
* Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak.
V. Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and darkness hath overwhelmed me.
R. Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak.

[Lectio2]
!2 Cor 1:6-7
6 Mert ha szenvedünk, az a ti vigasztalásotokra és üdvösségetekre szolgál, ha~
vigasztalásban van részünk, abból is ti nyertek bátorítást azoknak a~
szenvedéseknek türelmes elviselésére, amelyeket mi is szenvedünk.
7 Szilárd tehát veletek kapcsolatban a reményünk, hiszen tudjuk, hogy nemcsak a~
szenvedésben vesztek velünk együtt részt, hanem a vigasztalásból is hozzánk~
hasonlóan részesültök.

[Responsory2]
R. O God, Which satest in the throne judging right, be Thou a refuge for the~
poor, a refuge in times of trouble.
* For Thou alone beholdest mischief and spite.
V. The poor leaveth himself unto thee; Thou wilt be the helper of the~
fatherless.
R. For Thou alone beholdest mischief and spite.

[Lectio3]
!2 Cor 1:8-11
8 Nem szeretném, testvérek, hogy ne tudjatok arról az üldöztetésrõl, amely~
Ázsiában ért bennünket: módfelett, szinte erõnkön felül ránk nehezedett, úgyhogy~
már életünkrõl is lemondtunk.
9 Sõt magunkban már a halálos ítéletet is elfogadtuk, hogy ne magunkban bízzunk,~
hanem Istenben, aki feltámasztja a halottakat.
10 Õ mentett ki bennünket a súlyos életveszélybõl, és ezután is ki fog menteni.~
Belé vetjük minden reményünket, hogy ezentúl is mindig megment minket.
11 De ti is segítsetek: imádkozzatok értünk, hogy a nekünk jutott kegyelemért~
sokak ajkáról szálljon fel hála a nevünkben.

[Responsory3]
R. The Lord is at my right hand, I shall never be moved.
* Therefore my heart is glad, and my tongue rejoiceth.
V. The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup.
R. Therefore my heart is glad, and my tongue rejoiceth.
&Gloria
R. Therefore my heart is glad, and my tongue rejoiceth.

Sermon of S.John Chrysostom
!Preface for the letters of St Paul
As I listen intently to the reading of S.Paul's Epistles, often two or three times a week, whenever we commemorate the holy martyrs, I am filled with joy, delighting in the sound of that spiritual trumpet. And as I recognize the voice of a friend, I am roused, and enkindled with love so that I almost seem to see him present, and to hear him speaking. But nevertheless I am grieved, and am troubled, that all do not know this great man as he desrves to be known. Indeed, many are so ignorant that they do not even know how many epistles he wrote. But this ignorance is not due to a want of inteeligence on their part, but because they will not carefully study the writings of this great man.

[Responsory4]
R. O Lord, Thou hast shown me the path of life.
* Thou shalt fill me with joy in thy presence, at thy right hand there are~
pleasures for evermore.
V. Thou art He That shalt restore mine inheritance unto me.
R. Thou shalt fill me with joy in thy presence, at thy right hand there are~
pleasures for evermore.

[Lectio5]
For what we know, if we know anything, we do not know it owing to any superlative talent  or penetration, but, being strongly drawn towards this great man, we never cease from reading his works. For so it is that those who love any one usually know better than others what he has done, because they take the trouble to learn all about him. The blessed Paul himself shows that this is so, when he says to the Philippians: As it is meet for me to think this for you all : for that I have you in my heart; and in my bands, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel.

[Responsory5]
R. I will love thee, O Lord, my strength; the Lord is my rock
* And my fortress.
V. My Deliverer, my God, mine Helper.
R. And my fortress.

[Lectio6]
And if you also will diligently attend to the reading, you will have no need of other instruction. Most true are those words of Christ : Seek and you shall find : knock and it shall be opened unto you.  For the rest, since many of those who are assembled here are charged with the care of a wife, and with providing for a family, and with the bringing-up of children, and therefore cannot devote themselves wholly to this study; let them at least bestir themselves to receive what others have gathered; showing as much eagerness in listening to what is said about him as in acquiring wealth. For though it is unseemly to demand from you no more than this, yet it is to be wished that you do this at least.

[Responsory6]
R. The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof
* The world, and they that dwell therein.
V. For He hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods.
R. The world, and they that dwell therein.
&Gloria
R. The world, and they that dwell therein.

Evangélium szent János Apostol kõnyvébõl
!John 2:1-11
Azon idõben menyegzõt tartottak a galileai Kánában, amelyen Jézus anyja is ott~
volt. Jézust is meghívták a menyegzõre, tanítványaival együtt. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!Tract. 9. in John.
Even setting aside any mystical interpretation, the fact that the Lord was~
pleased to be asked, and to go to a marriage, showeth plainly enough that He is~
the Author and Blesser of marriage. There were yet to be those of whom the~
Apostle hath warned us as forbidding to marry ; who say that marriage is a bad~
thing in itself, and a work of the devil. Yet we read in the Gospel that when~
the Lord was asked, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?~
He answered that it was not lawful, except it were for fornication. In which~
answer ye will remember that He used these words : What God hath joined~
together, let not man put asunder.

[Responsory7]
R. Unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
* O my God, I trust in thee, let me not be ashamed.
V. O keep my soul and deliver me.
R. O my God, I trust in thee, let me not be ashamed.

[Lectio8]
They who are well instructed in the Catholic religion know that God is the~
Author and Blesser of marriage ; and that, whereas joining together in marriage~
is of God, divorce is of the devil. But it is lawful for a man to put away his~
wife in case of fornication, For by not keeping a wife's faith to her husband~
she herself hath first willed not to be wife. They also who have made a vow of~
their virginity to God and have thereby attained to an higher degree of honour~
and holiness in the Church, are not unmarried, for they are a special part of~
the marriage of the whole Church, which is the Bride of Christ.

[Responsory8]
@Tempora/Pent01-0:Responsory8

[Lectio9]
Lord, being asked, went to the marriage, to strengthen the marriage tie, and to~
shed light on the hidden meaning of matrimony. In that marriage feast the~
Bridegroom to whom it was said, " Thou hast kept the good wine until now," was a~
figure of the Lord Christ, Who hath kept until now the good wine, namely the~
Gospel.
&teDeum

[Versum 2]
V. The Lord reigneth He is clothed with majesty.
R. The Lord is clothed with strength, and has girded Himself with power.

[Ant 2]
There was a marriage * in Cana of Galilee: and Jesus was there, with Mary, his~
mother.

[Versum 3]
V. Uram, legyen imádságom
R. Illatáldozat szined elõtt.

[Ant 3]
The wine failing, * Jesus commanded the water pots to be filled with water,~
which was changed into wine, alleluia.
