[Ant 1]
I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up, * and the whole earth~
was full of His glory, and His train filled the Temple.

[Versum 1]
V. Let the evening prayer ascend unto thee, O Lord.
R. And let there descend upon us thy mercy.

Ezékiel Próféta könyvének kezdete
!Ezek 1:1-4
1 A 30. esztendőben, a negyedik hónapban, a hónap ötödik napján, amikor a~
száműzöttek között voltam a Kebár folyó mellett, megnyílt az ég, és isteni~
látomás tanúja voltam.
2 A hónap ötödik napján - Jojachin király száműzetésének 5. esztendejében az~
Úr szózatot intézett Ezekiel paphoz, Buzi fiához a káldeusok földjén, a Kebár~
folyó mellett. Ott fölöttem volt az Úr keze.
4 Ezt láttam: észak felől forgószél támadt és nagy felhő. Fényesség vette körül,~
tűz, amelyből villámok törtek elő. A belsejében, a tűz közepében valami fénylett,~
mint az érc.

!Ezek 1:5-9
5 Középütt kivettem valamit, amely négy élőlényhez hasonlított. Emberi formájuk~
volt.
6 Mindegyiknek négy arca és mindegyiknek négy szárnya volt.
7 A lábuk egyenes volt, a talpuk meg olyan, mint a borjú talpa, s úgy szikráztak,~
akár a fényes érc.
8 Szárnyaik alatt emberi kezek voltak. Arcuk - mind a négyüké - négy irányba~
nézett.
9 Az egyiknek a szárnya összeért a másikéval. Amikor mentek, nem fordultak meg,~
hanem mindegyik egyenesen haladt.

[Responsory2]
R. Look down, O Lord, from the dwelling-place of thine holiness, and take~
thought for us. O my God, incline thine ear, and hear.
* Open thine eyes, and behold our desolation.
V. Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, Thou That leadest Joseph like a flock.
R. Open thine eyes, and behold our desolation.

!Ezek 1:10-12
10 Arcuk emberi archoz hasonlított, és jobb felől mind a négynek oroszlánarca~
volt, bal felől meg mind a négynek bikaarca volt, s mind a négynek sasarca volt.
11 Szárnyaik felül ki voltak terjesztve. Két szárnya mindegyiknek összeért,~
kettő meg a testüket födte.
12 Mindegyik egyenesen ment maga előtt, oda mentek, ahova a lélek irányította~
őket, nem fordultak meg, amikor mentek.

[Responsory3]
R. Consider, O Lord, how that the city sitteth solitary that was full of riches;~
how is she become as a widow, she that was great among the nations;
* She hath none to comfort her, save thee, O our God
V. She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks.
R. She hath none to comfort her, save thee, O our God
&Gloria
R. She hath none to comfort her, save thee, O our God

From the Exposition of the Prophet Ezekiel written by Pope St Gregory (the~
Great.)
!Bk, i. Horn. 2.
It is the use of the Prophetic writers first to give name, date, and place, and~
then to begin to unfold the mysteries of the prophecy thus, to give certainty~
of trustworthiness, a foundation is laid before, and afterward the fruits of the~
Spirit are set forth by signs and in figures. Thus Ezekiel saith concerning the~
date: And it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the~
fifth day of the month. And to show the place, he addeth further As I was~
among the captives by the river of Chebar, the heavens were opened, and I saw~
visions of God. Then he defineth the time even more exactly, saying In the~
fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of King Jehoiachim's captivity.~
And he who had thus clearly indicated his individuality, goeth on farther to~
state his kin, saying The word of the Lord came unto Ezekiel, the son of Buzi,~
the Priest.

[Responsory4]
R. I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem
* Which shall never hold their peace day nor night, to praise the name of the~
Lord.
V. They shall proclaim My might unto the nations, and declare My glory unto the~
Gentiles.
R. Which shall never hold their peace day nor night, to praise the name of the~
Lord.

[Lectio5]
But the first question which meeteth us is, Wherefore doth the Prophet, having~
hitherto said nothing, begin with the words And it came to pass in the~
thirtieth year Now, this word And is a conjunction, and we know that it is so~
called because it conjoineth that which cometh after it with that which goeth~
before it. Wherefore, then, doth he who hath hitherto been silent, commence by~
And, when there is nothing going before for the conjunction tojoin to that which~
cometh after To explain this, we must consider that our senses perceive only~
things bodily, while those of Prophets perceive also things ghostly, and to them~
things exist which to our ignorance seem not to do so. Hence it cometh that in~
the mind of a Prophet, things outer and things inner are so joined that he seeth~
both together, and the word which he heareth within him and that which he~
uttereth come together.

[Responsory5]
R. Hedge us about with thy wall that cannot be broken down, O Lord, and shield~
us continually with the arms of thy might.
* O Lord God of Israel, deliver them that cry unto thee.
V. Deliver us also according to thy marvellous works, and give glory to thy~
Name.
R. O Lord God of Israel, deliver them that cry unto thee.

[Lectio6]
It appeareth plainly, therefore, that he which had hitherto been silent,~
beginneth by the words, And it came to pass in the thirtieth year, because his~
first utterance was but the continuation of something to which he had already~
been listening in his own mind. The words which he spoke were merely a~
continuation of the vision already going on within, and therefore the first are,~
And it came to pass. His language is framed as though his inner revelation had~
been an open one. That it was in the thirtieth year that the word of the Lord~
came unto Ezekiel, causeth us to remark that in the ordinary use of human~
understanding, men receive not a call to teach until they be of full age. Hence~
also even the Lord Himself, when He sat in the Temple in the midst of the~
doctors, in the twelfth year of His age, was pleased to be found, not teaching,~
but hearing them and asking them questions. (Luke ii. 46.)

[Responsory6]
R. We looked for peace, and it came not we asked for good, and behold trouble.~
We acknowledge, O Lord, our wickedness.
* Forget us not for ever.
V. O Lord (our God) we have sinned, we have done ungodly, we have dealt~
unrighteously in all thine ordinances.
R. Forget us not for ever.
&Gloria
R. Forget us not for ever.

[Responsory7]
R. Blessed is the people
* Whom the Lord of hosts hath blessed, saying O Israel thou art the work of~
Mine own hands, thou art Mine own inheritance.
V. Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord, and the people whom He hath~
chosen for His own inheritance.
R. Whom the Lord of hosts hath blessed, saying O Israel thou art the work of~
Mine own hands, thou art Mine own inheritance.
