A királyok első könyvéből
!1 Sam 10:17-19
17 Ekkor Sámuel összehívta a népet az Úr elé Micpába, 
18 és így szólt Izrael fiaihoz: "Ezt mondja az Úr, Izrael Istene: Kivezettem Izraelt Egyiptomból és kiszabadítottalak benneteket az egyiptomiaknak és minden királynak a hatalmából, aki csak szorongatott titeket. 
19 Mégis, ma elvetettétek Isteneteket, aki kiszabadított benneteket minden veszedelemből és szorongattatásból, és kijelentettétek: Nem, adj nekünk királyt! Rajta hát, járuljatok az Úr elé törzseitek és nemzetségeitek rendjében." 

[Lectio2]
!1 Sam 10:20-24
20 Ekkor Sámuel minden törzset előléptetett, és a sorsvetés Benjamin törzsére esett. 
21 Most a nemzetségek szerint léptette elő Benjamin törzsét, és a sorsvetés Matri nemzetségére esett. Amikor Matri nemzetségének tagjait léptette elő, egymás után, a sorsvetés Kis fiára, Saulra esett. Keresték, de nem találták sehol. 
22 Megkérdezték újra az Urat: "Eljött ide az az ember?" Az Úr azt felelte: "Igen, a málhák közt rejtőzik." 
23 Odasiettek és előhozták onnét. Amikor a nép körébe lépett, egy fejjel magasabb volt mindenkinél. 
24 Ekkor Sámuel így szólt az egész néphez: "Nézzétek, akit az Úr kiválasztott, ahhoz hasonló nincs közöttetek." A nép ujjongott és felkiáltott: "Éljen a király!" 

[Lectio3]
!1 Sam 10:25-27
25 Ezután Sámuel kihirdette az egész népnek a királyság törvényét, bevezette egy könyvbe és az Úr elé tette. Aztán hazaküldte a népet, mindenkit a maga otthonába. 
26 Saul is hazament Gibeába. A bátrabbak, akiknek a szívét Isten megérintette, mellé szegődtek. Néhány semmirekellő azonban így beszélt: "Ugyan mit segíthet ez rajtunk?" S lenézték és nem vittek neki ajándékot.

!From the Encyclical Letter of Pope Pius XI
No effort on our part could have availed for the expiation of human sin, if the~
Son of God had not assumed human nature in order to redeem men from their sins.~
This truth the Saviour of mankind hath made known in the words of the Psalmist :~
Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me ; in~
burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure ; then said I,~
Lo, I come. Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows : he was~
wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities : who his own~
self bare our sins in his body on the Tree ; and blotting out the handwriting of~
ordinances that was against us, which same was contrary to us, he took it out of~
the way, nailing it to his Cross : that we, being dead unto sins, should live~
unto righteousness. But although this plenteous redemption of Christ was more~
than sufficient to satisfy for all our offenses, nevertheless, (due to the~
wondrous dispensation of the divine Wisdom, whereby in our own flesh we may fill~
up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ for his body's sake, which~
is the Church,) we can, and in fact, we should, add our own acts of praise and~
satisfaction to those acts of praise and satisfaction which Christ, in the name~
of sinners, presented to God.

[Lectio5]
However, we must always remember this, to wit : The expiatory value of our acts~
is dependent upon the Bloody Sacrifice of Christ ; which same is presented~
bloodlessly on our altars, without pretermission. Note that in both the~
Unbloody and the Bloody Sacrifice, the Victim is one and the same. He that~
offered himself on the Cross is the very same that doth offer himself by means~
of our ministerial priesthood ; the only difference being the manner in which~
the Sacrifice is made ; for which reason there must needs be conjoined to the~
august Sacrifice of the Holy Eucharist, and act of immolation from the priests~
and the faithful, whereby they offer up themselves, also, to be a reasonable,~
holy, and living sacrifice, acceptable unto God. With this in mind Saint~
Cyprian dared to affirm that the Sacrifice of the Lord is not complete so far as~
our sanctification is concerned until our personal offerings and sacrifices are~
brought into union with his passion. To which end we have been given apostolic~
admonition : That we should always bear about in the body of the dying of the~
Lord Jesus ; and thereby, buried with him by Baptism unto death, not only can we~
crucify the flesh with its affections and lusts, thus escaping the corruption~
that is in the world, through lust, but also thereby the life of Jesus can be~
made manifest in our bodies ; and so, having been made partakers of Christ in~
his holy and eternal priesthood, we should offer both gifts and sacrifices for~
sins.

[Lectio6]
And note who they are that be partakers in the mysteries of such a priesthood,~
and in the duty of offering sacrifices and satisfaction to God ; not only they~
who have been ordained as ministers of such sacrifices, to wit, to offer unto~
the divine Name in every place a pure offering, from the rising of the sun even~
unto the going down of the same, but also all others who are Christians ; which~
same by the Prince of the Apostles are called, and rightly so, a chosen~
generation, a royal priesthood, who are to offer sacrifices for sin, not only~
for themselves but for all mankind, and this in much the same way as every~
priest and high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in the things~
that appertain to God.

[Lectio7]
The Lesson is taken from the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 19:31-37
At that time : The Jews, because it was the Preparation, that the bodies should~
not remain upon the cross on the Sabbath Day, for that Sabbath Day was an high~
day, besought Pilate that their legs might broken, and that they might be taken~
away. And so on, and that which followeth.
_
!A Homily by St. Lawrence Justinian the Bishop
But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not~
his legs, but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith~
came there out blood and water. Truly this is a great and unheard-of wonder,~
that from a lifeless body should gush out blood and water! And thereby we are~
constrained to believe that God willed to set forth the great mystery, namely,~
the oneness between Christ and the Church. Consider how aforetime a figure of~
this spiritual union was given us in the Scriptures, where we are told that,~
from the side of Adam as he slept, one of his ribs was taken, wherefrom was~
formed Eve, the mother of us all, which same is understood to be a type of the~
Church. For thereby the Holy Ghost signified that there was to be a true and~
spiritual Adam, fashioned by the same Paraclete, from whose side, while he slept~
on the Cross, the Church would be formed, a comely spouse radiant with youth,~
that is, without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing.

[Lectio8]
For the blood and water are the Sacraments of the Church, whereby the whole body~
of the Church is washed and sanctified. Certain it is that in the laver of~
regenerating water, (which same was consecrated by the death of Christ,) the~
Church is cleansed from original sin. And not only is purification given~
thereby, but entrance to the heavenly kingdom is also made. Both these things~
are done at one and the same time, nor doth one avail for salvation without the~
other ; for no one can take unto himself the inheritance of the blessedness~
which is to come without the Sacrament of Baptism and the remission of sins.~
This truth is confessed all the world over by holy Mother Church, and confirmed~
by manifold testimonies in the Word of God. Moreover, he too bare witness, who~
saw the water and blood flow forth from the side of Christ, and his testimony is~
true. Now this is John the Apostle and Evangelist who was loved with an~
exceeding great love by the Lord.

[Lectio9]
Verily, all these things were done that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, which~
say : A bone of him shall not be broken : which same was in obedience to the~
Lord's commandment to Moses, that in the sacrifice of the Passover, (wherein was~
celebrated the offering up of the lamb,) no bone should be broken. Wherefrom,~
when this ancient prototype was fulfilled in the most innocent Lamb, (the Lord~
Jesus himself,) obedience to the ancient command was also fulfilled. For in no~
wise were his legs broken, after the manner of what was done to the two~
malefactors hanging with him ; but his side alone was opened, that another~
Scripture might be fulfilled, which saith : They shall look upon him whom they~
have pierced. Moreover, the Lord willed to retain the marks of the Wounds in~
his body, thereby to incite the devotion of the elect, and also be an~
unanswerable testimony of damnation to the reprobate. And so all things were~
consummated in Christ, which had been long before declared by the oracles of the~
Prophets, that the Catholic faith might be strengthened both in itself and~
against the errors of the hereticks.
