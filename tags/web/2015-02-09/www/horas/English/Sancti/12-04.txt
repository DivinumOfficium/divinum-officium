[Lectio4]
Peter, called in Greek Chrysologos, or, of the golden words, on account of his~
wonderful eloquence, was born of respectable parents at Imola, near Ravenna. He~
displayed a very early leaning to godliness, and became a disciple of Cornelius~
of Rome, Bishop of Imola. This Prelate, having experience of his learning and~
holiness of life, soon ordained him Deacon. On the death of the Archbishop of~
Ravenna, the people of that place elected a successor, and sent him, according~
to custom, to Rome, to be confirmed in his appointment by Pope Sixtus III. The~
Archbishop elect accordingly set forth, along with the ambassadors of the people~
of Ravenna and Cornelius, Bishop of Imola, attended by Peter the Deacon. While~
they were yet on the way, the holy Apostle Peter and Apollinaris the Martyr~
appeared to the Supreme Pontiff in a dream, leading a young man between them,~
whom they commanded him to make Archbishop. As soon as the embassy arrived at~
Rome the Pope knew in Peter the young man of his dream, chosen of God to the~
Archbishopric. Wherefore he set aside him that the people of Ravenna had~
presented, and preferred Peter to that Metropolitan Church, in the year of our~
Lord, 433. The ambassadors of the people of Ravenna took it ill, till they heard~
the vision then they gave themselves up to the will of God, and received the new~
Archbishop with great reverence.

[Lectio5]
Peter being against his will consecrated Archbishop, arrived at Ravenna, where~
he was received with great joy by the Emperor Valentinian, the Empress-Mother~
Galla Placidia, and all the people. And this one thing he asked of them, that,~
as he, for the saving of their souls, had not refused to bear the heavy weight~
of the Archbishopric, so they would strive to follow his warnings, and live in~
submission to the law of God. He took the bodies of the two Saints, namely,~
Barbatian the Priest, and German, Bishop of Auxerre, and caused them to be~
embalmed with rich ointments and honourably buried, and he kept the cowl and~
haircloth shirt of German for a legacy for himself. At Classis, three miles from~
Ravenna, he built a Baptistery of extraordinary size, and several splendid~
churches, in honour of the blessed Apostle Andrew and other Saints. He preached a~
most severe sermon against the acting and dancing of guisards about New Year~
time, in which discourse he said among other things, He that jesteth with the~
devil will never rejoice with Christ. By command of Pope Leo I. he addressed an~
Epistle to the Council of Chalcedon against the heretic Eutyches. He also~
confuted Eutyches himself in another letter, which is likewise published in the~
new editions of the Acts of the Council, and is matter of Church History.

[Lectio6]
When he preached in public his vehemence was such that he sometimes became~
speechless from excitement. This happened to him once when he was preaching on~
the subject of the woman who had an issue of blood. (Matth. ix. 20-22.) The~
congregation on this occasion were so wrought up, that they filled the whole~
place with tears, cries, and prayers, and Peter afterwards thanked God, Who had~
turned his failure to the profit of their souls. When he had ruled the Church of~
Ravenna in holiness for about eighteen years, God gave him knowledge that the~
end of his labours was at hand, and he returned to his home at Imola, to die.~
When he arrived at Imola, he entered the church of St Cassian, and offered upon~
the High Altar a great circlet of gold, set with stones of great price, a golden~
chalice and a silver paten. Water poured out of these vessels hath often healed~
hydrophobia and fevers. Some of the people of Ravenna had followed the~
Archbishop, but he now dismissed them, with a charge to use great prudence in~
their choice of his successor. Then he fell to prayer, that God would mercifully~
receive his spirit, asking the same likewise for the sake of his patron St~
Cassian, and so he passed in peace to a better life, on a 2nd of December, about~
the year of our Lord 450. His holy body was buried, amid the sorrow and~
veneration of the whole city, hard by the remains of St Cassian, where it lieth~
even to this day, guarded with great reverence. One arm was cut off and sent to~
Ravenna, where it is preserved in the Ursian Church, in a reliquary of gold and~
precious stones.

[Lectio94]
Peter named 'Chrysologus', because of his golden quality of his eloquence, was~
born of good parents at Imola in Aemelia. Turning to religion from his earliest~
youth, he put himself under Cornelius of Rome, at that time bishop of Imola, who~
recognized his worth and ordained him deacon. In spite of his protests, Sixtus~
III proclaimed him archbishop of Ravenna, where he was received by the people~
with the greatest reverence. He was outstanding for his pastoral work and, in a~
sermon designed to put a stop to the customary games and masques, he made the~
famous statement: "The man who wants to play with the devil will not be able to~
rejoice with Christ." Divinely forewarned that the end of his life was~
approaching, he went back to his native town and, going into the church of St.~
Cassian, offered gifts and humbly begged God and his holy patron mercifully to~
receive his soul. He departed this life on December 2, in the eighteenth year of~
his episcopate, His holy body was buried with great honor next to that of St,~
Cassian.
