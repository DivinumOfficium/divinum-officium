Sub unica conclusione in commemoratione

[Oratio]
O God, who desirest that all men should be saved,~
and come to the knowledge of the truth: send forth,~
we beseech thee, labourers into thy harvest, and grant~
them grace to speak thy word with all trust, that thy~
words may run and be glorified, and that all nations~
may know thee, the one true God, and him whom~
thou hast sent, Jesus Christ thy Son our Lord.
$Qui tecum

[Secreta]
Turn thine eyes, O God, our protector, and look~
upon the face of thy Christ, who hath given himself~
as a ransom for all, and grant that from the rising of~
the sun even unto the setting thereof thy name may be great~
among the Gentiles, and that in every place there~
may be sacrifice, and a clean oblation offered to thy name.
$Per eundem

[Postcommunio]
Revived by this atoning sacrifice, we beseech thee, O~
Lord, that by means of this help to eternal salvation~
true Faith may ever advance.
$Per Dominum
