(Canticle of_Simeon * Luke 2:29-32)
2:29 Now thou dost dismiss thy servant, O Lord, + * according to thy word in peace;
2:30 Because my eyes have seen * thy salvation,
2:31 Which thou hast prepared * before the face of all peoples:
2:32 A light to the revelation of the Gentiles, * and the glory of thy people Israel.
