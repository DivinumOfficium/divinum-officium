Lesson from the first book of Samuel
!1 Sam 12:1-5
1 And Samuel said to all Israel: Behold I have hearkened to your voice in all~
that you said to me, and have made a king over you.
2 And now the king goeth before you: but I am old and greyheaded: and my sons~
are with you: having then conversed with you from my youth unto this day, behold~
here I am.
3 Speak of me before the Lord, and before his anointed, whether I have taken any~
man's ox, or ass: If I have wronged any man, if I have oppressed any man, if I~
have taken a bribe at any man's hand: and I will despise it this day, and will~
restore it to you.
4 And they said: Thou hast not wronged us, nor oppressed us, nor taken ought at~
any man's hand.
5 And he said to them: The Lord is witness against you, and his anointed is~
witness this day, that you have not found any thing in my hand. And they said:~
He is witness.

[Responsory1]
R. Lord, when thy people shall turn again to thee, and shall pray unto thee in~
this house
* then hear Thou in heaven, O Lord, and deliver them out of the hand of their~
enemies.
V. If thy people sin against thee, and turn again, and repent, and come and pray~
unto thee in this house.
R. Then hear Thou in heaven, O Lord, and deliver them out of the hand of their~
enemies.

!1 Sam 12:6-9
6 And Samuel said to the people: It is the Lord, who made Moses and Aaron, and~
brought our fathers out of the land of Egypt.
7 Now therefore stand up, that I may plead in judgment against you before the~
Lord, concerning all the kindness of the Lord, which he hath shown to you, and~
to your fathers:
8 How Jacob went into Egypt, and your fathers cried to the Lord: and the Lord~
sent Moses and Aaron, and brought your fathers out of Egypt: and made them dwell~
in this place.
9 And they forgot the Lord their God, and he delivered them into the hands of~
Sisara, captain of the army of Hasor, and into the hands of the Philistines, and~
into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.

[Responsory2]
R. And it came to pass when the Lord would take up Elijah into heaven by a~
whirlwind
* Elisha cried, and said: My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the~
horsemen thereof.
V. And as they still went on, and talked, behold, there appeared a chariot of~
fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder, and Elijah went up by a~
whirlwind into heaven.
R. Elisha cried, and said: My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the~
horsemen thereof.

!1 Sam 12:10-14
10 But afterwards they cried to the Lord, and said: We have sinned, because we~
have forsaken the Lord, and have served Baalim and Astaroth: but now deliver us~
from the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.
11 And the Lord sent Jerobaal, and Badan, and Jephte, and Samuel, and delivered~
you from the hand of your enemies round about, and you dwelt securely.
12 But seeing that Naas king of the children of Ammon was come against you, you~
said to me: Nay, but a king shall reign over us: whereas the Lord your God was~
your king.
13 Now therefore your king is here, whom you have chosen and desired: Behold the~
Lord hath given you a king.
14 If you will fear the Lord, and serve him, and hearken to his voice, and not~
provoke the mouth of the Lord: then shall both you, and the king who reigneth~
over you, be followers of the Lord your God

[Responsory3]
R. Thus saith the Lord I took thee out of thy father's house, and appointed~
thee to be ruler over My people, over Israel.
* And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, to establish thy kingdom for~
ever.
V. And I have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that~
are in the earth and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies.
R. And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, to establish thy kingdom for~
ever.
&Gloria
R. And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, to establish thy kingdom for~
ever.
