4:1 (Unto the end, in verses. A psalm for David.)
4:2 When I called upon him, the God of my justice heard me: when I was in distress, thou hast enlarged me. Have mercy on me: and hear my prayer.
4:3 O ye sons of men, how long will you be dull of heart? why do you love vanity, and seek after lying?
4:4 Know ye also that the Lord hath made his holy one wonderful: the Lord will hear me when I shall cry unto him.
4:5 Be ye angry, and sin not: the things you say in your hearts, be sorry for them upon your beds.
4:6 Offer up the sacrifice of justice, and trust in the Lord: many say, Who sheweth us good things?
4:7 The light of thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us: thou hast given gladness in my heart.
4:8 By the fruit of their corn, their wine, and oil, they rest:
4:9 In peace in the self same I will sleep, and I will rest:
4:10 For thou, O Lord, singularly hast settled me in hope.
