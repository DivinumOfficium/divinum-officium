Lesson from the first book of Samuel
!1 Sam 8:4-6
4 Then all the ancients of Israel being assembled, came to Samuel to Ramatha.
5 And they said to him: Behold thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways:~
make us a king, to judge us, as all nations have.
6 And the word was displeasing in the eyes of Samuel, that they should say: Give~
us a king, to judge us. And Samuel prayed to the Lord.

!1 Sam 7-9
7 And the Lord said to Samuel: Hearken to the voice of the people in all that~
they say to thee. For they have not rejected thee, but me, that I should not~
reign over them.
8 According to all their works, they have done from the day that I brought them~
out of Egypt until this day: as they have forsaken me, and served strange gods,~
so do they also unto thee.
9 Now therefore hearken to their voice: but yet testify to them, and foretell~
them the right of the king, that shall reign over them.

!1 Sam 10-14
10 Then Samuel told all the words of the Lord to the people that had desired a~
king of him,
11 And said: This will be the right of the king, that shall reign over you: He~
will take your sons, and put them in his chariots, and will make them his~
horsemen, and his running footmen to run before his chariots,
12 And he will appoint of them to be his tribunes, and centurions, and to plough~
his fields, and to reap his corn, and to make him arms and chariots.
13 Your daughters also he will take to make him ointments, and to be his cooks,~
and bakers.
14 And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your best oliveyards,~
and give them to his servants.
