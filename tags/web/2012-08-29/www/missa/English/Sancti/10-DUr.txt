Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Colossenses
!Col 1:12 - 20.
Brethren: We give thanks to God the Father Who has made us worthy to share the lot of the saints in light. He has rescued us from the power of darkness, and transferred us into the kingdom of His beloved Son, in Whom we have our redemption through His blood, the remission of sins. He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature. For in Him were created all things in the heavens and on the earth, things visible and things invisible, whether Thrones, or Dominations, or Principalities, or Powers. All things have been created through and unto Him, and He is before all creatures, and in Him all things hold together. Again, He is the head of the body, the Church; He, Who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things He may have the first place. For it has pleased [God the Father] that in Him all fullness should dwell and that through Him He should reconcile to Himself all things, whether on the earth or in the heavens, making peace through the blood of His Cross, in Christ Jesus our Lord.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 18:33 - 37.
 At that time, Pilate said to Jesus, Are You the King of the Jews? Jesus~
answered, Do you say this of yourself, or have others told you of Me? Pilate~
answered, Am I a Jew? Your own people and the chief priests have delivered You~
to me. What have You done? Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world. If~
My kingdom were of this world, My followers would certainly have fought that I~
might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is, My kingdom is not from here.~
Pilate therefore said to Him, You are then a King? Jesus answered, You say it: I~
am a King. This is why I was born, and why I have come into the world, to bear~
witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice.
