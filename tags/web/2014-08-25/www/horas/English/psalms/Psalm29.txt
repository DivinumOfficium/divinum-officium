29:1 (A psalm of a canticle, at the dedication of David's house.)
29:2 I will extol thee, O Lord, for thou hast upheld me: and hast not made my enemies to rejoice over me.
29:3 O Lord my God, I have cried to thee, and thou hast healed me.
29:4 Thou hast brought forth, O Lord, my soul from hell: thou hast saved me from them that go down into the pit.
29:5 Sing to the Lord, O ye his saints: and give praise to the memory of his holiness.
29:6 For wrath is in his indignation; and life in his good will. In the evening weeping shall have place, and in the morning gladness.
29:7 And in my abundance I said: I shall never be moved.
29:8 O Lord, in thy favour, thou gavest strength to my beauty. Thou turnedst away thy face from me, and I became troubled.
29:9 To thee, O Lord, will I cry: and I will make supplication to my God.
29:10 What profit is there in my blood, whilst I go down to corruption? Shall dust confess to thee, or declare thy truth?
29:11 The Lord hath heard, and hath had mercy on me: the Lord became my helper.
29:12 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into joy: thou hast cut my sackcloth, and hast compassed me with gladness:
29:13 To the end that my glory may sing to thee, and I may not regret: O Lord my God, I will give praise to thee for ever.
