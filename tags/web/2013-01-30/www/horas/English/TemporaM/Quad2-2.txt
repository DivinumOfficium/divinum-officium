Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 23:1-12
In that time Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples, Saying: The~
scribes and the Pharisees have sitten on the chair of Moses. All things~
therefore whatsoever they shall say to you, observe and do: but according to~
their works do ye not; for they say, and do not. And so on.
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Bk. iv. Comm. on Matth. xxiii.
Was there ever man gentler and kinder than the Lord? The Pharisees tempted Him;~
their craft was confounded, and, in the words of the Psalmist, The arrows of~
babes have pierced them, (Ps. lxiii. 8,) and nevertheless, because of the~
dignity of their priesthood and name, He exhorteth the people to be subject to~
them, by doing according to their words, though not according to their works. By~
the words Moses' seat we are to understand the teaching of the law. Thus also~
must we mystically take, Sitteth in the seat of the scornful, (Ps. i. 1,) and~
likewise, overthrew the seats of them that sold doves, (Matth. xxi. 12,) to~
describe doctrine.

How they bind heavy burdens, and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's~
shoulders, but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.~
This is generally directed against all teachers who command things hard, and~
themselves do not even things easy. But it is to be remarked that the shoulders,~
the fingers, and the binding of the burdens, have a spiritual interpretation.~
But all their works they do for to be seen of men. Whosoever therefore doth~
anything for to be seen of men, the same is, so far, a Scribe and a Pharisee.

[Lectio3]
They make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments.~
And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,~
and greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi. Woe to us~
miserable sinners who have inherited the vices of the Pharisees! When the Lord~
had given the commandments of the law to Moses He added afterwards Thou shalt~
bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between~
thine eyes, (Deut. vi. 8.) The sense of these words is My Law shall be in~
thine hand to order whatsoever thou doest, and ever before thine eyes that thou~
mayest meditate therein day and night. But the Pharisees, by a bad~
interpretation, were accustomed to write on pieces of parchment the Decalogue of~
Moses, that is, the Ten Words of the Law, and to tie these pieces of parchment,~
plaited in a peculiar manner, on their foreheads, so as to make a sort of crown~
round their heads, which projected in front of their eyes, and always moved~
before them.

[Ant 2]
For One is your Master, * Which is in heaven, even Christ the Lord.

[Oratio 2]
Enable us, O Lord, we beseech thee, to carry to a perfect end this holy and~
helpful observance, that what we know we have to do by thine ordinance we may be~
holpen to do by thy strength.
$Per Dominum

[Ant 3]
And all ye are brethren, * and call no man your father upon earth for One is~
your Father, Which is in heaven neither be ye called masters, for One is your~
Master, even Christ.

[Oratio 3]
Tend thy merciful ears, O Lord, we beseech thee, unto our supplications, and~
heal the sickness of our souls, that we, receiving thy pardon, may rejoice for~
ever in thy blessing.

Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 23:1-12
23:1 THEN Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples,
23:2 Saying: The scribes and the Pharisees have sitten on the chair of Moses.
23:3 All things therefore whatsoever they shall say to you, observe and do: but according to their works do ye not; for they say, and do not.
23:4 For they bind heavy and insupportable burdens, and lay them on men's shoulders; but with a finger of their own they will not move them.
23:5 And all their works they do for to be seen of men. For they make their phylacteries broad, and enlarge their fringes.
23:6 And they love the first places at feasts, and the first chairs in the synagogues,
23:7 And salutations in the market place, and to be called by men, Rabbi.
23:8 But be not you called Rabbi. For one is your master; and all you are brethren.
23:9 And call none your father upon earth; for one is your father, who is in heaven.
23:10 Neither be ye called masters; for one is you master, Christ.
23:11 He that is the greatest among you shall be your servant.
23:12 And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled: and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.
