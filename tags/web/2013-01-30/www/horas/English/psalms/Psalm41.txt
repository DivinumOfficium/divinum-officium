41:1 (Unto the end, understanding for the sons of Core.)
41:2 As the hart panteth after the fountains of water; so my soul panteth after thee, O God.
41:3 My soul hath thirsted after the strong living God; when shall I come and appear before the face of God?
41:4 My tears have been my bread day and night, whilst it is said to me daily: Where is thy God?
41:5 These things I remembered, and poured out my soul in me: for I shall go over into the place of the wonderful tabernacle, even to the house of God: With the voice of joy and praise; the noise of one feasting.
41:6 Why art thou sad, O my soul? and why dost thou trouble me? Hope in God, for I will still give praise to him: the salvation of my countenance,
41:7 And my God. My soul is troubled within my self: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan and Hermoniim, from the little hill.
41:8 Deep calleth on deep, at the noise of thy flood-gates. All thy heights and thy billows have passed over me.
41:9 In the daytime the Lord hath commanded his mercy; and a canticle to him in the night. With me is prayer to the God of my life.
41:10 I will say to God: Thou art my support. Why hast thou forgotten me? and why go I mourning, whilst my enemy afflicteth me?
41:11 Whilst my bones are broken, my enemies who trouble me have reproached me; Whilst they say to me day by day: Where is thy God?
41:12 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why dost thou disquiet me? Hope thou in God, for I will still give praise to him: the salvation of my countenance, and my God.
