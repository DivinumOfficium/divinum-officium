34:1 Judge thou, O Lord, them that wrong me: * overthrow them that fight against me.
34:2 Take hold of arms and shield: * and rise up to help me.
34:3 Bring out the sword, and shut up the way against them that persecute me: * say to my soul: I am thy salvation. 
34:4 Let them be confounded and ashamed * that seek after my soul.
34:5 Let them be turned back and be confounded * that devise against me.
34:6 Let them become as dust before the wind: * and let the Angel of the Lord straiten them.
34:7 Let their way become dark and slippery; * and let the Angel of the Lord pursue them.
34:8 For without cause they have hidden their net for me unto destruction: * without cause they have upbraided my soul.
34:9 Let the snare which he knoweth not come upon him: and let the net which he hath hidden catch him: * and into that very snare let them fall.
34:10 But my soul shall rejoice in the Lord; * and shall be delighted in his salvation.
34:10 All my bones shall say: * Lord, who is like to thee?
34:10 Who deliverest the poor from the hand of them that are stronger than he; * the needy and the poor from them that strip him.
34:11 Unjust witnesses rising up *have asked me things I knew not.
34:12 They repaid me evil for good: * to the depriving me of my soul.
34:13 But as for me, when they were troublesome to me, * I was clothed with haircloth.
34:14 I humbled my soul with fasting; * and my prayer shall be turned into my bosom.
34:15 As a neighbour and as an own brother, so did I please: * as one mourning and sorrowful so was I humbled.
34:16 But they rejoiced against me, and came together: * scourges were gathered together upon me, and I knew not.
34:17 They were separated, and repented not: they tempted me, they scoffed at me with scorn: * they gnashed upon me with their teeth.
34:17 Lord, when wilt thou look upon me? * rescue thou my soul from their malice: my only one from the lions.
34:18 I will give thanks to thee in a great church; * I will praise thee in a strong people.
34:19 Let not them that are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: * who have hated me without cause, and wink with the eyes.
34:20 For they spoke indeed peaceably to me; * and speaking in the anger of the earth they devised guile.
34:21 And they opened their mouth wide against me; * they said: Well done, well done, our eyes have seen it.
34:22 Thou hast seen, O Lord, be not thou silent: * O Lord, depart not from me.
34:23 Arise, and be attentive to my judgment: * to my cause, my God, and my Lord.
34:24 Judge me, O Lord my God according to thy justice, * and let them not rejoice over me.
34:25 Let them not say in their hearts: It is well, it is well, to our mind: * neither let them say: We have swallowed him up.
34:26 Let them blush: and be ashamed together, * who rejoice at my evils.
34:27 Let them be clothed with confusion and shame, * who speak great things against me.
34:28 Let them rejoice and be glad, who are well pleased with my justice, * and let them say always: The Lord be magnified, who delights in the peace of his servant.
34:28 And my tongue shall meditate thy justice, * thy praise all the day long.
