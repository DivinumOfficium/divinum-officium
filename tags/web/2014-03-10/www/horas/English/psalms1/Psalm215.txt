(Canticle of_Isaias * Isa 45:15-30)
45:15 Verily thou art a hidden God, * the God of Israel the saviour.
45:16 They are all confounded and ashamed: * the forgers of errors are gone together into confusion.
45:17 Israel is saved in the Lord with an eternal salvation: * you shall not be confounded, and you shall not be ashamed for ever and ever.
45:18 For thus saith the Lord that created the heavens, * God himself that formed the earth, and made it, the very maker thereof:
45:19 He did not create it in vain: he formed it to be inhabited. * I am the Lord, and there is no other.
45:20 I have not spoken in secret, * in a dark place of the earth:
45:21 I have not said to the seed of Jacob: Seek me in vain. * I am the Lord that speak justice, that declare right things.
45:22 Assemble yourselves, and come, and draw near together, * ye that are saved of the Gentiles:
45:23 They have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven work, * and pray to a god that cannot save.
45:24 Tell ye, and come, and consult together: * who hath declared this from the beginning, who hath foretold this from that time?
45:25 Have not I the Lord, and there is no God else besides me? * A just God and a saviour, there is none besides me.
45:26 Be converted to me, and you shall be saved, all ye ends of the earth: * for I am God, and there is no other.
45:27 I have sworn by myself, the word of justice shall go out of my mouth, * and shall not return:
45:28 For every knee shall be bowed to me, * and every tongue shall swear.
45:29 Therefore shall he say: In the Lord are my justices and empire: * they shall come to him, and all that resist him shall be confounded.
45:30 In the Lord shall all the seed * of Israel be justified and praised.
