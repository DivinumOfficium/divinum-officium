Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus
!Sir 14:1-5
1 Blessed is the man that hath not slipped by a word out of his mouth, and is not pricked with the remorse of sin.
2 Happy is he that hath had no sadness of his mind, and who is not fallen from his hope.
3 Riches are not comely for a covetous man and a niggard, and what should an envious man do with gold?
4 He that gathereth together by wronging his own soul, gathereth for others, and another will squander away his goods in rioting.
5 He that is evil to himself, to whom will he be good? and he shall not take pleasure in his goods.

!Sir 14:6-10
6 There is none worse than he that envieth himself, and this is the reward of his wickedness:
7 And if he do good, he doth it ignorantly, and unwillingly: and at the last he discovereth his wickedness.
8 The eye of the envious is wicked: and he turneth away his face, and despiseth his own soul.
9 The eye of the covetous man is insatiable in his portion of iniquity: he will not be satisfied till he consume his own soul, drying it up.
10 An evil eye is towards evil things: and he shall not have his fill of bread, but shall be needy and pensive at his own table.

!Sir 14:11-17
11 My son, if thou have any thing, do good to thyself, and offer to God worthy offerings.
12 Remember that death is not slow, and that the covenant of hell hath been shown to thee: for the covenant of this world shall surely die.
13 Do good to thy friend before thou die, and according to thy ability, stretching out thy hand give to the poor.
14 Defraud not thyself of the good day, and let not the part of a good gift overpass thee.
15 Shalt thou not leave to others to divide by lot thy sorrows and labours?
16 Give and take, and justify thy soul.
17 Before thy death work justice: for in hell there is no finding food.
