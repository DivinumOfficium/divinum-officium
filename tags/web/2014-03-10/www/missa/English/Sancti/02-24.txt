Lesson from the Acts of Apostles
!Acts 1:15-26
In those days, Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren - now the number of persons met together was about a hundred and twenty -, and he said, Brethren, the Scripture must be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit declared before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was the guide of those who arrested Jesus; inasmuch as he had been numbered among us and was allotted his share in this ministry. And he indeed bought a field with the price of his iniquity and, being hanged, burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out. And it became known to all the residents of Jerusalem, so that the field came to be called in their language Haceldama, that is, the Field of Blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, ‘Let their habitation become desolate and let there be none to dwell in it.’ And, ‘His ministry let another take.’ Therefore, of these men who have been in our company all the time that the Lord Jesus moved among us, from John’s baptism until the day that He was taken up from us, of these one must become a witness with us of His Resurrection.” And they put forward two: Joseph, called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed and said, You, Lord, Who know the hearts of all, show which of these two You have chosen to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell away to go to his own place. And they drew lots between them, and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt. 11:25-30
At that time, Jesus spoke and said, I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You hid these things from the wise and prudent, and revealed them to little ones. Yes, Father, for such was Your good pleasure. All things have been delivered to Me by My Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father; nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and him to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him. Come to Me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn from Me, for I am meek and humble of heart; and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden light.

[Offertorium]
