The Lord, even the Lord our God * hear your prayers, and be at one with you, and~
never forsake you in time of trouble.

R. And let there descend upon us thy mercy.

Here beginneth the second book of the Macchabees
!2 Mac 1:1-6
1 To the brethren the Jews that are I throughout Egypt, the brethren, the Jews~
that are in Jerusalem, and in the land of Judea, send health, and good peace.
2 May God be gracious to you, and remember his covenant that he made with~
Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, his faithful servants:
3 And give you all a heart to worship him, and to do his will with a great heart,~
and a willing mind.
4 May he open your heart in his law, and in his commandments, and send you~
peace.
5 May he hear your prayers, and be reconciled unto you, and never forsake you in~
the evil time.
6 And now here we are praying for you.

!2 Mac 1:18-19
18 Therefore whereas we purpose to keep the purification of the temple on the~
five and twentieth day of the month of Casleu, we thought it necessary to~
signify it to you: that you also may keep the day of Scenopegia, and the day of~
the fire, that was given when Nehemias offered sacrifice, after the temple and~
the altar was built.
19 For when our fathers were led in Persia, the priests that then were~
worshippers of God took privately the fire from the altar, and hid it in a~
valley where there was a deep pit without water, and there they kept it safe,

!2 Mac 1:20-22
20 But when many years had passed, and it pleased God that Nehemias should be~
sent by the king of Persia, he sent some of the posterity of those priests that~
had hid it, to seek for the fire: and as they told us, they found no fire, but~
thick water.
21 Then he bade them draw it up, and bring it to him: and the priest Nehemias~
commanded the sacrifices that were laid on, to be sprinkled with the same water,~
both the wood, and the things that were laid upon it.
22 And when this was done, and the time came that the sun shone out, which~
before was in a cloud, there was a great fire kindled, so that all wondered.

From blessed John Chrysostom 
!On Psalm 43
Deus, auribus nostris audivimus, patres nostri annuntiaverunt nobis opus, quod~
operatus es in diebus eorum. Hunc Psalmum dicit quidem Propheta, dicit autem non~
ex persona propria, sed ex persona Machabaeorum, narrans et praedicens quae~
futura erant illo tempore. Tales enim sunt Prophetae: omnia tempora percurrunt,~
praesentia, praeterita, futura. Quinam sint autem hi Machabaei, quidque passi~
sint, et quid fecerint, necessarium est primum dicere, ut sint apertiora quae in~
argumento dicuntur. Ii enim, cum invasisset Judaeam Antiochus, qui dictus est~
Epiphanes, et omnia devastasset, et multos qui tunc erant, a patriis institutis~
resilire coegisset, permanaerunt illaesi ab illis tentationibus.

Et quando grave quidem bellum ingruebat, nec quidquam possent facere quod~
prodesset, se abscondebant: nam hoc quoque fecerunt Apostoli. Non enim semper~
apparentes in media irruebant pericula, sed nonnumquam et fugientes, et latentes~
secedebant. Postquam autem parum respirarunt, tamquam generosi quidam catuli ex~
antris exsilientes, et e latebris emergentes, statuerunt non se amplius solos~
servare, sed etiam alios quoscumque possent: et civitatem et omnem regionem~
obeuntes, collegerunt quotquot invenerunt adhuc sanos et integros: et multos~
etiam qui laborabant et corrupti erant, in statum pristinum redegerunt, eis~
persuadentes redire ad legem patriam.

[Lectio6]
Deum enim dicebant esse benignum et clementem, nec umquam adimere salutem, quae~
proficiscitur ex poenitentia. Haec autem dicentes, habuerunt delectum~
fortissimorum virorum. Non enim pro uxoribus, liberis, et ancillis, patriaeque~
eversione et captivitate, sed pro lege et patria republica pugnabant. Eorum~
autem dux erat Deus. Cum ergo aciem dirigerent, et suas animas prodigerent,~
fundebant adversarios, non armis fidentes, sed loco omnis armaturae, pugnae~
causam sufficere ducentes. Ad bellum autem euntes non tragaedias excitabant, non~
poeana canebant, sicut nonnulli faciunt: non asciverunt tibicines, ut fit in~
aliis castris: sed Dei superne auxilium invocabant, ut adesset, opem ferret, et~
manum praeberet, propter quem bellum gerebant, pro cujus gloria decertabant.
