[Lectio]
Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Philippians
!Phil 1:6-11
Brethren: We are confident in the Lord Jesus that He Who has begun a good work in you will bring it to perfection until the day of Christ Jesus. And I have the right to feel so about you all, because I have you in my heart, all of you, alike in my chains and in the defense and confirmation of the Gospel, as sharers in my joy. For God is my witness how I long for you all in the heart of Christ Jesus. And this I pray, that your charity may more and more abound in knowledge and all discernment, so that you may approve the better things, that you may be upright and without offense unto the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of justice, through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.

[Graduale]
!Ps 132:1-2
Behold how good it is, and how pleasant where brethren dwell as one!
V. It is as when the precious ointment upon the head runs down over the beard,~
the beard of Aaron.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 22:15-21
At that time, the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might trap Jesus in~
His talk. And they sent to Him their disciples with the Herodians, saying,~
Master, we know that You are truthful, and that You teach the way of God in~
truth, and that You care naught for any man; for You do not regard the person of~
men. Tell us, therefore, what do You think: Is it lawful to give tribute to~
Caesar, or not? But Jesus, knowing their wickedness, said, Why do you test Me,~
you hypocrites? Show Me the coin of the tribute. So they offered Him a~
denarius. Then Jesus said to them, Whose are this image and the inscription?~
They said to Him, Caesar’s. Then He said to them, Render, therefore, to Caesar~
the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.

[Offertorium]
!Esther 14:12-13
Remember me, O Lord, You Who rule above all power: and give a well-ordered~
speech in my mouth, that my words may be pleasing in the sight of the prince.

[Secreta]
Grant, O merciful God, that this saving sacrifice may always free us from sin,~
and protect us from all that works against us.

[Communio]
!Ps 16:6
I call upon You, for You will answer me, O God; incline Your ear to me; hear my~
word.

[Postcommunio]
We who have received the gift of Your blessed sacrament, O Lord, humbly pray~
that what You have taught us to do in commemoration of You, may profit and help~
us in our weakness.
