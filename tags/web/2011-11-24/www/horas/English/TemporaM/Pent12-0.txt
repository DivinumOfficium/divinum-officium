[Oratio]
Almighty and merciful God, of Whose only gift it cometh that thy faithful people~
do unto thee true and laudable service, grant, we beseech thee, that we may so~
faithfully serve thee in this life, that we fail not finally to attain thy~
heavenly promises.

From the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 10:23-37
At that time Jesus said unto His disciples Blessed are the eyes which see~
the things that ye see. For I tell you that many prophets and kings have desired~
to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them. And so on.
_
Homily by the Venerable Bede, Priest at Jarrow.
!Bk. iii. ch. 43 on Luke x.
Blessed were the eyes not of Scribes and Pharisees, which saw but the Body of~
the Lord, but those eyes, eyes blessed indeed, which were able to see those~
things whereof it is written "Thou hast hid these things from the wise and~
prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes." Blessed are the eyes of those~
little ones unto whom it seemeth good in the eyes of the Son to reveal Himself~
and the Father also. Abraham rejoiced to see the day of Christ and he saw it,~
and was glad. (John viii. 56.) Isaiah, and Micah, and many among the Prophets,~
saw the glory of the Lord, wherefore also they be called Seers, but all they~
beheld it and hailed it afar off, seeing but as through a glass, darkly. (1 Cor.~
xiii. 12.)

[Lectio8]
Otherwise were the Apostles, who saw the Lord face to Face, eating with Him, and~
learning from Him by asking whatsoever they listed. For them there was no need~
to be taught by Angels, or the shifting fabric of visions. They whom Luke doth~
call Prophets and kings, Matthew nameth as " Prophets and righteous men " (xiii.~
17.) Righteous men are indeed mighty kings, who know how to lord it over their~
own rebellious temptations, instead of falling under them to become their~
slaves.

[Lectio9]
"And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted Him, saying Master, what~
shall I do to inherit eternal life?" This lawyer, who stood up to ask the Lord a~
tempting question touching eternal life, took the subject of his asking, as I~
think, from the words which the Lord had just uttered, when He said "Rejoice,~
because your names are written in heaven" (20.) But his attempt was a proof of~
the truth of that which the Lord immediately added "I thank thee, O Father,~
Lord of heaven and earth, that Thou hast hid these things from the wise and~
prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes!"

Master, what shall I do * to inherit eternal life? He said unto him What is~
written in the law How readest thou And he, answering, said Thou shalt~
love the Lord thy God with all thy heart. Alleluia.

Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 10:23-37
10:23 And turning to his disciples, he said: Blessed are the eyes that see the things which you see.
10:24 For I say to you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see the things that you see, and have not seen them; and to hear the things that you hear, and have not heard them.
10:25 And behold a certain lawyer stood up, tempting him, and saying, Master, what must I do to possess eternal life?
10:26 But he said to him: What is written in the law? how readest thou?
10:27 He answering, said: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind: and thy neighbour as thyself.
10:28 And he said to him: Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.
10:29 But he willing to justify himself, said to Jesus: And who is my neighbour?
10:30 And Jesus answering, said: A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers, who also stripped him, and having wounded him went away, leaving him half dead.
10:31 And it chanced, that a certain priest went down the same way: and seeing him, passed by.
10:32 In like manner also a Levite, when he was near the place and saw him, passed by.
10:33 But a certain Samaritan being on his journey, came near him; and seeing him, was moved with compassion.
10:34 And going up to him, bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine: and setting him upon his own beast, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
10:35 And the next day he took out two pence, and gave to the host, and said: Take care of him; and whatsoever thou shalt spend over and above, I, at my return, will repay thee.
10:36 Which of these three, in thy opinion, was neighbour to him that fell among the robbers?
10:37 But he said: He that shewed mercy to him. And Jesus said to him: Go, and do thou in like manner.
