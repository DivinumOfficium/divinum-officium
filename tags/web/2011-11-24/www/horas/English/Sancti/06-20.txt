OPapaM=Sylvester;

[Ant 1]
This man is holy * for he hath striven for the law of his God even unto death,~
and hath not feared for the words of the ungodly; For he had his foundation upon a~
strong rock.

[Versum 1]
V. Thou hast crowned him with glory and honour, O Lord.
R. And madest him to have dominion over the works of thy~
hands.

[Oratio]
Mercifully consider our weakness, O Almighty God, and whereas by the burden of~
our sins we are sore let Silverii Pape your Martyr be mercifully pleased to~
deliver us from all things which may hurt our bodies, and from all evil thoughts~
which may defile our souls
$Per Dominum

[Lectio93]
THIS Silverius was a native of Campania, and succeeded Agapitus in the Papacy~
(in the year 536.) His orthodoxy and holiness shone brightest in his onslaughts~
upon heretics, and he showed admirable firmness in upholding a sentence by~
Agapitus. Agapitus had deposed Anthimus from the Patriarchate of Constantinople~
for defending Save the heresy of Eutyches; and Silverius would never allow of~
his restoration, although the Empress Theodora repeatedly asked him to do so.~
The woman was enraged at him on this account, and ordered Bellisarius to send~
Silverius into exile. He was accordingly banished to the island of Ponza, whence~
he is said to have written these words to Bishop Amator I am fed upon the~
bread of tribulation and the water of affliction, but nevertheless I have not~
given up, and I will not give up, doing my duty. But sickness and the hardships~
of his exile soon broke his strength, and he fell asleep in the Lord upon the~
20th day of June (in the year of grace 538.) Many miracles shed a lustre upon~
his grave. He ruled the Church for more than three years, and ordained in the~
month of December thirteen Priests, five Deacons, and nineteen Bishops for~
divers Sees.

[Ant 2]
He that hateth his life * in this world, shall keep it unto life eternal.

[Versum 2]
V. The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree.
R. He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
