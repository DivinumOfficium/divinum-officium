Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Romans
!Rom 8:1-4
8:1 THERE is now therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not according to the flesh.
8:2 For the law of the spirit of life, in Christ Jesus, hath delivered me from the law of sin and of death.
8:3 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh; God sending his own Son, in the likeness of sinful flesh and of sin, hath condemned sin in the flesh;
8:4 That the justification of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit.

[Lectio2]
!Rom 8:5-8
8:5 For they that are according to the flesh, mind the things that are of the flesh; but they that are according to the spirit, mind the things that are of the spirit.
8:6 For the wisdom of the flesh is death; but the wisdom of the spirit is life and peace.
8:7 Because the wisdom of the flesh is an enemy to God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither can it be.
8:8 And they who are in the flesh, cannot please God.

[Lectio3]
!Rom 8:9-11
8:9 But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
8:10 And if Christ be in you, the body indeed is dead, because of sin; but the spirit liveth, because of justification.
8:11 And if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead, dwell in you; he that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead, shall quicken also your mortal bodies, because of his Spirit that dwelleth in you.
