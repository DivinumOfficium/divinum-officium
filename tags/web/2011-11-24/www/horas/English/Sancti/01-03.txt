Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Romans
!Rom 6:1-5
 6:1 WHAT shall we say, then? shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
6:2 God forbid. For we that are dead to sin, how shall we live any longer therein?
6:3 Know you not that all we, who are baptized in Christ Jesus, are baptized in his death?
6:4 For we are buried together with him by baptism into death; that as Christ is risen from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also may walk in newness of life.
6:5 For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection.

[Lectio2]
!Rom 6:6-11
6:6 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin may be destroyed, to the end that we may serve sin no longer.
6:7 For he that is dead is justified from sin.
6:8 Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall live also together with Christ:
6:9 Knowing that Christ rising again from the dead, dieth now no more, death shall no more have dominion over him.
6:10 For in that he died to sin, he died once; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God:
6:11 So do you also reckon, that you are dead to sin, but alive unto God, in Christ Jesus our Lord.

[Lectio3]
!Rom 6:12-18
6:12 Let no sin therefore reign in your mortal body, so as to obey the lusts thereof.
6:13 Neither yield ye your members as instruments of iniquity unto sin; but present yourselves to God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of justice unto God.
6:14 For sin shall not have dominion over you; for you are not under the law, but under grace.
6:15 What then? Shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.
6:16 Know you not, that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants you are whom you obey, whether it be of sin unto death, or of obedience unto justice.
6:17 But thanks be to God, that you were the servants of sin, but have obeyed from the heart, unto that form of doctrine, into which you have been delivered.
6:18 Being then freed from sin, we have been made servants of justice.

The Lesson is taken from a treatise of St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo,)
! on John. (36.) 
Of the Four Evangelists, or, rather, the Four Writers of the 'one Evangel,~
the holy Apostle John hath not unworthily been compared by spiritual writers to~
an eagle, because of the lofty and glorious flight of his teaching, soaring~
above the other three; a flight that raiseth not himself alone, but also the~
hearts of all, whosoever will hear him. The other three writers walk with the~
Lord upon earth, as with a man, and enlarge little upon His Godhead; but John,~
as though it had wearied him to walk upon earth, in the very first words of his~
writing, riseth not above the earth only, or above the firmament, and the~
heavens, but above every angel, and above every power of things unseen, and~
flieth directly to Him by Whom all things were made, saying In the beginning~
was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

[Lectio5]
Then he goeth on worthily of such a beginning, and speaketh of the Lord's~
Godhead as none hath ever spoken, uttering freely the things which he had heard.~
It is not without cause that it is told of him in that Gospel how he lay on~
Jesus' Breast at supper. Truly he drank secretly from that Breast, and what he~
drank secretly he hath uttered openly, that all men may know not only how the~
Son of God became man, suffered, and rose again for us, but likewise how He was~
with the Father before He took flesh, the Onlybegotten Son, the Word of the~
Father, co-eternal with Him that begat Him, equal to Him That sent Him.

[Lectio6]
John is an eagle that soareth up to the things that are not made, and fixeth his~
eye unquailing upon the secret and eternal Light. It is said that the~
father-eagle taketh his young in his talons and flieth with them, that they may~
look at the sun. Them that look at it boldly, he acknowledgeth for his own~
offspring, but them whose eyes shrink, he letteth fall from his claws as~
bastards. Let us consider, then, how mightily he must speak who is likened to an~
eagle; and yet we who are reptiles crawling on earth, weak, and of small~
consideration even among men, dare take in hand these utterances, to treat of~
them, and to explain them, and think that our intelligence understandeth them,~
or our speech commendeth them.

From the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 21:20-24
In that time Jesus said to Peter: Follow me. Peter turning about, saw that~
disciple whom Jesus loved following. And so on.
_
Homily by St John Chrysostom, Patriarch (of Constantinople.)
!87th Homily. on John.
Christ had made known great things to Peter, charged him with the care of the~
whole world, announced to him his future martyrdom, and given him testimony of~
His especial love. Peter then would have John for a fellow and helper, and he~
said, What shall this man do? as it were, Shall not he also follow the same~
path with me? At the supper, when Peter would ask a question of the Lord, he~
dared not, but got John for his spokesman; and now Peter asketh that which he~
thought John fain would know, but dared not ask for himself. Christ saith unto~
him If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?

[Lectio8]
Peter asked because of his great love for John, hoping not to be parted from him,~
and Christ answered him, that with whatever affection he loved him, he could not~
love him as He loved him. If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to~
thee? Let us learn from these words, by the teaching of Christ, neither to~
chafe, nor to enquire too curiously, where the will of God is concerned. For~
when Peter would be still asking, the Lord at length checked him in these words~
for his continued curiosity.

[Lectio9]
When went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not~
die; yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry~
till I come, what is that to thee? That is, He would not have it thought that~
He had disposed of them both in the same way. He spoke thus that He might check~
the untimely motion of affection, and the desire to continue the old~
companionship. The Apostles were about to take in charge the whole earth, and it~
behoved them no more to continue together, lest the world should suffer.~
Therefore the Lord saith to Peter Thou hast received thy task; bend thyself~
to it, and do it; work and fight; what is it to thee if I will that he tarry~
here? Turn thou to thine own appointed labour and finish it.
