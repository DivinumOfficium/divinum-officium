Mercifully consider our weakness, O Almighty God, and whereas by the burden of~
our sins we are sore let blessed Pius, your Martyr be mercifully pleased to~
deliver us from all things which may hurt our bodies, and from all evil thoughts~
which may defile our souls

[Lectio93]
Pius I., the son of Rufinus, was from Aquilia, and was a Priest of the holy~
Roman Church when he was made Supreme Pontiff, he lived under the Emperors~
Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius, he held five ordinations in the month of~
December, wherein he ordained twelve Bishops and eighteen Priests. There remain~
several eminent ordinances of his, notably that which ruleth that the~
Resurrection of the Lord be not observed upon any day of the week save the~
Lord's Day. He turned the house of Pudens into a church, and on account of its~
eminence above the other churches, as being that where the Bishop of Rome dwelt,~
he dedicated it under the name of the Shepherd. Here he often celebrated, and~
baptized and numbered among the faithful many converts to the faith. While he~
strove to do the work of a good shepherd he shed his blood for his sheep, and~
for the chief Shepherd Christ. He was crowned with martyrdom upon the 11th day~
of July, and buried upon the Vatican Hill.
