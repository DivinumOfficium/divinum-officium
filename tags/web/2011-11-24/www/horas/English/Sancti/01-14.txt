[Lectio4]
This Hilary was born of a noble family in Acquitaine, and is distinguished as a~
divine and an orator. He was married in his earlier life, but even then lived~
the life of a monk and on account of his remarkable holiness, was ultimately~
made Bishop of Poitiers, (about the year 353,) in which office he did his duty~
so as to gain the universal praise of the faithful. At that time the Emperor~
Constantius was persecuting the Catholics by threats, by the plundering of their~
goods, by exile, and at length, by every species of cruelty, in order to force~
them to yield to the Arian heresy. Against the Arians Hilary set himself up as a~
brazen wall, and turned upon himself the fierceness of their anger. They~
assailed him by many artifices, and at last Saturnine, Bishop of Aries, at the~
Council of Beziers, (in 356,) procured his banishment to Phrygia. During this~
exile he raised a dead man to life, and wrote a work in twelve books on the~
Trinity, against the Arians.

[Lectio5]
In (the year 359,) the fourth of his exile, took place the Council of Seleucia~
in Isauria, at which Hilary was obliged to be present, but afterwards withdrew~
to Constantinople. Here he realised more sharply the awful nature of this crisis~
in the history of Christianity, published three pamphlets in the form of letters~
to the Emperor, and demanded from that Prince leave to hold a public disputation~
in his presence. The Arian Bishops Ursacius and Valens, whom Hilary had already~
confuted in writing, were afraid to meet him in debate, and therefore induced~
Constantius, under pretence of pardon, to send him back to his Bishoprick, (in~
360.) His mother, the Church of Gaul, to use the language of Jerome, received~
him with open arms on his return from the battle with the heretics. He was~
followed to Poitiers by Martin, afterwards Bishop of Tours, whose after holiness~
was a fruit of his teaching.

[Lectio6]
Henceforth he ruled the Church of Poitiers in great peace. By his exertions the~
Church of Gaul was led to denounce the Arian blasphemy. His wonderful learning~
is seen in his numerous works, of which Jerome write to Laeta that he deemeth~
them quite faultless. One can follow Hilary in his books, saith he, without~
tripping once. He passed from earth to heaven upon the thirteenth day of January,~
in the year of our Lord 369, in the reign of the Emperors Valentinian and~
Valens. He had already been called an illustrious Doctor of the Church, by many~
Fathers and Councils, and was so styled in the Liturgy in some Dioceses, when at~
length, (in the year 1850,) Pope Pius IX., at the prayer of the Synod of~
Bordeaux, and in accordance with a resolution of the Sacred Congregation of~
Rites, proclaimed and confirmed the title, and commanded that the Mass and~
Office of his Feast should be everywhere said as those of a Doctor.

[Lectio93]
!Commemoratio for St Felix, Priest and Martyr.
Felix was a Priest of Nola, who on account of his fiery zeal against idolatry,~
suffered much persecution from the heathens, and was cast into prison. From~
thence an angel delivered him by night, and bade him go to Maximian, Bishop of~
Nola. This Bishop, enfeebled by old age, had at length despaired of power to~
withstand the torments of the persecutors, and had hidden, himself in a wood.~
Thither came Felix, by the will of God, and found the holy bishop lying~
half-dead upon the ground. He succoured him, and carried him upon his shoulders~
to the house of an holy widow. On another occasion, Felix, having again provoked~
the anger of the devil-worshippers, became an object of their pursuit, from~
which he hid himself in a narrow place between two walls. Hardly had he entered,~
when some spiders wove their webs across the entrance, which the enemy~
perceiving, concluded that no man had entered, and passed by. After leaving this~
hiding-place, Felix lay for three months in the house of an holy woman. After~
the Lord gave peace to His Church, the Saint returned to Nola, where he turned~
many to Christ by his life, his preaching, and his miracles. He steadily refused~
to accept the Bishoprick, fell asleep in the Lord, and was buried at Nola in the~
place called The Pines.

[Lectio94]
Hilarius born of a noble family in Aquitaine, had few equals in teaching and~
eloquence. Made bishop of Poitiers, he exercised his ministry in such a way as~
to gain the highest praise from the faithful. His vigorous campaign for the~
Catholic faith led to a four year exile in Phrygia. There he raised a dead man~
to life and performed other miracles. He wrote twelve books on the Trinity~
against the Arians, and induced all Gaul to condemn the Arian blasphemy He wrote~
many books showing wonderful learning; St. Jerome writing to Laeta, testifies in~
these words that they can be read with out the least fear of error: one can run~
through Hilary's works without stumbling." He went to heaven on the l3th of~
January in the year 369. Pins IX, at the request of the synod of Bordeaux,~
declared and confirmed him to be a Doctor of the universal Church.
