91:1 It is good to give praise to the Lord: * and to sing to thy name, O most High.
91:2 To shew forth thy mercy in the morning, * and thy truth in the night:
91:3 Upon an instrument of ten strings, upon the psaltery: * with a canticle upon the harp.
91:4 For thou hast given me, O Lord, a delight in thy doings: * and in the works of thy hands I shall rejoice.
91:5 O Lord, how great are thy works! * thy thoughts are exceeding deep.
91:6 The senseless man shall not know: * nor will the fool understand these things.
91:7 When the wicked shall spring up as grass: * and all the workers of iniquity shall appear:
91:8 That they may perish for ever and ever: * but thou, O Lord, art most high for evermore.
91:9 For behold thy enemies, O Lord, for behold thy enemies shall perish: * and all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
91:10 But my horn shall be exalted like that of the unicorn: * and my old age in plentiful mercy.
91:11 My eye also hath looked down upon my enemies: * and my ear shall hear of the downfall of the malignant that rise up against me.
91:12 The just shall flourish like the palm tree: * he shall grow up like the cedar of Libanus.
91:13 They that are planted in the house of the Lord * shall flourish in the courts of the house of our God.
91:14 They shall still increase in a fruitful old age: * and shall be well treated, that they may shew,
91:15 That the Lord our God is righteous, * and there is no iniquity in him.
