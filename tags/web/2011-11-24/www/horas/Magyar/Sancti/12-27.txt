Olvasmány szent János apostol elsõ levelébõl
!1 John 1:1-5
1 Ami kezdettõl fogva volt, amit hallottunk, amit a szemünkkel láttunk, amit~
szemléltünk és amit a kezünkkel tapintottunk: az élet Igéjét hirdetjük nektek.
2 Igen, az élet megjelent, láttuk, tanúságot teszünk róla, és hirdetjük nektek~
az örök életet, amely az Atyánál volt, és megjelent nekünk.
3 Amit láttunk és hallottunk, azt nektek is hirdetjük, hogy ti is közösségben~
legyetek velünk. Mi ugyanis az Atyával és az õ Fiával, Jézus Krisztussal vagyunk~
közösségben.
4 S azért írjuk ezeket nektek, hogy örömünk teljes legyen.
5 Az üzenet, amelyet tõle hallottunk és nektek hirdetünk, ez: Az Isten~
világosság, és nincs benne semmi sötétség.

[Responsory1]
R. Very worshipful is blessed John, which leaned on the Lord's Breast at supper.
* To Him did Christ upon the Cross commit His mother, maiden to maiden.
V. The Lord chose him for his clean maidenhood, and loved him more than all the~
rest.
R. To him did Christ upon the Cross commit His mother, maiden to maiden.

[Lectio2]
!1 John 1:6-10
6 Ha azt állítjuk, hogy közösségben vagyunk vele, és sötétségben járunk, akkor~
hazudunk, és nem az igazságot tesszük.
7 De ha világosságban járunk, ahogy õ is világosságban van, akkor közösségben~
vagyunk egymással, és Fiának, Jézusnak a vére minden bûnt lemos rólunk.
8 Ha azt állítjuk, hogy nincs bûnünk, saját magunkat vezetjük félre, és nincs~
meg bennünk az igazság.
9 Ha megvalljuk bûneinket, akkor mivel jó és igazságos, megbocsátja bûneinket,~
és minden igazságtalanságtól megtisztít minket.
10 Ha azt állítjuk, hogy nem vétkeztünk, hazugnak tüntetjük fel, és tanítása~
nincs bennünk.

[Responsory2]
R. This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these~
things.
* And we know that his testimony is true.

[Lectio3]
!1 John 2:1-5
1 Gyermekeim! Ezeket azért írom, hogy ne kövessetek el bûnt. De ha valaki bûnbe~
esik, van szószólónk az Atyánál: Jézus Krisztus, az Igaz.
2 Õ az engesztelõ áldozat bûneinkért, nemcsak a mieinkért, hanem az egész világ~
bûneiért is.
3 Abból tudjuk meg, hogy megismertük, hogy megtartjuk a parancsait.
4 Aki azt mondja: "ismerem", de a parancsait nem tartja meg, az hazudik, és~
nincs meg benne az igazság.
5 De aki megtartja tanítását, abban az Isten szeretete valóban tökéletes. Innen~
tudjuk meg, hogy benne vagyunk.

[Lectio4]
From the Book on Ecclesiastical writers, written by St Jerome, Priest (at~
Bethlehem.) on Ecclesiastical writers
!Ch 9
The Apostle John whom Jesus loved was a son of Zebedee, and brother of the~
Apostle James, who was beheaded by Herod soon after our Lord suffered. He was~
the last of the Evangelists to write his Gospel, which he published at the~
request of the Bishops of Asia, against Cerinthus and other heretics, and~
particularly against the then spreading doctrine of the Ebionites, who asserted~
that Christ had had no existence before Mary. It was therefore needful for the~
Evangelist to declare His Eternal and Divine Generation.

[Responsory4]
R. Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in My temple, saith the Lord,
* And I will write My name upon him, and the name of the city, which is New~
Jerusalem.
V. To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in~
the midst of the Paradise of My God.
R. And I will write My name upon him, and the name of the city, which is New~
Jerusalem.

[Lectio5]
In the fourteenth year after Nero, Domitian stirred up the second persecution,~
and John was exiled to the island of Patmos, where he wrote his Apocalypse,~
which hath been explained by Justin the Martyr and Irenaeus. When Domitian was~
killed, the Senate annulled all his acts, on account of his savage cruelty, and~
the Apostle returned to Ephesus, during the reign of Nerva. He remained at~
Ephesus until the time of Trajan, and founded and governed all the Churches of~
Asia. There, in an extreme old age, he died, in the sixty-eighth year after the~
Lord's passion, and was buried near the city.

[Responsory5]
R. Jesus loved him, because his singular gift of purity made him more worthy of~
love.
* He chose him for a virgin unto Himself, and he remaineth a virgin for ever.
V. At the end, when He was dying upon the Cross, to him did He commit His mother,~
maiden to maiden.
R. He chose him for a virgin unto Himself, and he remaineth a virgin for ever.

[Lectio6]
From the Commentary upon the Epistle to the Galatians, by the same author
!iii. 6.
The Blessed Evangelist John lived at Ephesus down to an extreme old age, and, at~
length, when he was with difficulty carried to the Church, and was not able to~
exhort the congregation at length, he was used simply to say at each meeting, My~
little children, love one another. At last the disciples and brethren were weary~
with hearing these words continually, and asked him, Master, wherefore ever~
sayest thou this only? Whereto he replied to them, (worthy of John,) It is the~
commandment of the Lord, and if this only be done, it is enough.

[Responsory6]
R. In the midst of the congregation did the Lord open his mouth.
* And filled him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding.
V. He made him rich with joy and gladness.
R. And filled him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding.
&Gloria
R. And filled him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding.

Evangélium szent János Apostol kõnyvébõl
!John 21:19-24
Azon idõben mondá Jézus Péternek: "Kövess engem!" Péter hátrafordult, s látta,~
hogy az a tanítvány, akit Jézus kedvelt az követi. És így tovább.
_
Homily on this passage by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo,)
!124 on the Tract on John.
The Church knoweth of two different lives which God hath revealed and blessed~
one is the life of faith, the other the life of knowledge one the life of this~
pilgrimage, the other the life of the eternal mansions; one the life of work,~
the other the life of rest one the life of the journey, the other the life of~
home; one the life of action, the other the life of contemplation. The one~
escheweth evil and doeth good; the other hath no evil to eschew, and only an~
exceeding good to enjoy. The one striveth with the enemy, the other hath no~
enemies, and reigneth.

[Responsory7]
R. In that day will I take thee, O My servant, and will make thee as a signet~
before Me.
* For I have chosen thee, saith the Lord.
V. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.
R. For I have chosen thee, saith the Lord.

[Lectio8]
The one succoureth the needy; the other is where there are no needy to succour. The~
one forgiveth them that trespass against it, that its own trespasses may be~
forgiven; the other neither hath trespasses to forgive nor to be forgiven. The~
one is chastened with evil, lest it be exalted above measure by good; the other~
enjoyeth such a fulness of grace that it feeleth no evil, and cleaveth so firmly~
unto the Highest Good, that it hath no temptation to pride.

[Responsory8]
R. This is that John which leaned on the Lord's Breast at supper
* Even that blessed Apostle unto whom were made known the secret things of~
heaven.
V. He drank in the rivers of the Gospel from the Lord's Breast, as from an holy~
fountain.
R. Even that blessed Apostle unto whom were made known the secret things of~
heaven.
&Gloria
R. Even that blessed Apostle unto whom were made known the secret things of~
heaven.

[Lectio9]
Therefore the one is good, but still sorrowful; the other is better and~
perfectly blessed. And of these two lives there are types, of the one in the~
Apostle Peter, of the other in John. The one laboureth here even unto the end,~
and findeth its end hereafter; the other stretcheth out into the hereafter, and~
in eternity findeth no end. Therefore is it said unto the one, Follow Me; but of~
the other, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? Follow~
thou Me. What is the meaning of these words? who can know? who can understand?~
what is it? is it Follow thou Me, imitating Me in the bearing of earthly sorrow;~
let him tarry till I come again, bringing the everlasting reward?
