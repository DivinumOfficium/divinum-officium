[Lectio4]
From the Sermons of the Venerable Bede, Priest (at Jarrow.)
!18th on the Saints.
Therefore, may it be our delight to go on unto this prize of good living. Freely~
and cheerfully let us strive in the race, running under the eyes of God and of~
Christ. We have already taken a station above floating and earthly things, and~
let us allow no love for things fleeting to hamper our running. If the last day~
shall find us lithe and speedful in the race of good living, we shall never have~
to complain that our Master is a scanty rewarder of our works.

[Lectio5]
That giveth a red crown for suffering under persecution, the same giveth a white~
crown to them that under peace, prevail in battles of righteousness. Neither~
Abraham, nor Isaac, nor Jacob, were slain, and nevertheless in honour for faith~
and righteousness, they have gained the first place among the Patriarchs, and it~
is to sit down with them in the kingdom of God that are gathered the faithful,~
the righteous, and the praiseworthy. We must remember that it is God's will, and~
not our own will, that we must do, for he that doeth His will abideth for ever,~
even as He abideth for ever.

[Lectio6]
Therefore, dearly beloved brethren, with mind clear, faith firm, courage true,~
love thorough, let us be ready to do whatever God willeth, keeping stoutly all~
the commandments of the Lord, having innocency in simplicity, peaceableness in~
love, modesty in lowliness, in ministering diligence, in helping them that toil~
watchfulness, in succouring the poor mercifulness, in standing up for the truth~
firmness, in keeping of discipline sternness, lest we be found wanting in any~
good work. These are the steps which the Saints who have already gone home have~
left marked for us, that we may be able to keep in their footprints, and so to~
follow them into their joy.

Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 5:1-12
 A tömeg láttára fölment a hegyre és leült. Tanítványai köréje gyűltek És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!Bk. i. on the Lord's Sermon, Ch. and 4.
First, Blessed are the poor in spirit. Secondly, Blessed are the meek. Thirdly,~
Blessed are they that mourn. They that are blessed under this third head,~
having knowledge, do mourn that they possess not yet the Highest Good, which~
possession belongeth unto the end of their course. But in the fourth place,~
Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness. Here there is~
that earnest striving, wherewith the mind doth struggle to tear herself away~
from those things whose deathful sweetness would make her fain to cling unto~
them. Here is hungering and thirsting after righteousness, and there is sore~
need of firmness, for what it is a joy to have, it must be a grief to lose. But~
the fifth head is the declaration that Blessed are the merciful, and in these~
words a door of comfort and reward is opened unto the toiling. Entangled in such~
straits a man can be of no use to himself, unless One That is stronger than he~
help him; and if he be helped of the Stronger, it is but just that he in turn~
should help such as is weaker than himself. And so, Blessed are the merciful,~
for, in their turn, they shall obtain mercy from God.

[Lectio8]
Blessed are the pure in heart. This sixth benediction is pronounced upon those~
hearts which by pure, clear consciousness of good works are able to look to that~
Highest Good, Which only the clear, calm mind can perceive. Lastly cometh in the~
seventh place that Blessed are the peacemakers, that is to say, blessed are~
they who cultivate wisdom, which is the contemplation of the True, since it is~
the fruit of this contemplation of the True to produce profound and utter~
internal peace in man, and to catch the reflection of the Divine, this being~
the idea which is expressed in the words: Blessed are the peacemakers, for they~
shall be called the children of God. The eighth phrase is a return to the first,~
since it showeth lowliness of spirit in its aspect of completion and crowning;~
and thence the kingdom of heaven is the reward mentioned in both places.~
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for their's is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed~
are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for their's is the~
kingdom of heaven.

[Lectio9]
Paul saith Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation,~
or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? There~
are therefore seven things which bring to perfection, for the eighth is the~
glorification and manifestation of that which is perfected, that from this head~
others again may begin, and be finished. It seemeth to me also that these heads~
and sayings have some connection with the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost whereof~
Isaiah speaketh. But there is a difference of order, for there the highest is~
taken first, but here the lowest; there the wisdom of God, but here the fear of~
God, but the beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord.
