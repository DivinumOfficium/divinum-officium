[Ant 1]
The child Samuel ministered unto God * before Eli, and the word of the Lord was~
precious in his sight.

O Lord, Who never failest to help and govern them whom Thou dost bring up in thy~
steadfast fear and love keep us, we beseech thee, under the protection of thy~
good providence, and make us to have a perpetual fear and love of thy Holy Name

Lesson from the first book of Samuel
!1 Sam 4:1-3
1 And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered themselves~
together to fight: and Israel went out to war against the Philistines, and~
camped by the Stone of help. And the Philistines came to Aphec,
2 And put their army in array against Israel. And when they had joined battle,~
Israel turned their backs to the Philistines, and there was slain in that fight~
here and there in the fields about four thousand men.
3 And the people returned to the camp: and the ancients of Israel said: Why hath~
the Lord defeated us today before the Philistines? Let us fetch unto us the ark~
of the covenant of the Lord from Silo, and let it come in the midst of us, that~
it may save us from the hand of our enemies.

!1 Sam 4:4-6
4 So the people sent to Silo, and they brought from thence the ark of the~
covenant of the Lord of hosts sitting upon the cherubims: and the two sons of~
Heli, Ophni and Phinees, were with the ark of the covenant of God.
5 And when the ark of the covenant of the Lord was come into the camp, all~
Israel shouted with a great shout, and the earth rang again.
6 And the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, and they said: What is this~
noise of a great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the~
ark of the Lord was come into the camp.

!1 Sam 4:7-11
7 And the Philistines were afraid, saying: God is come into the camp. And~
sighing, they said:
8 Woe to us: for there was no such great joy yesterday and the day before: Woe~
to us. Who shall deliver us from the hand of these high gods? these are the gods~
that struck Egypt with all the plagues in the desert.
9 Take courage and behave like men, ye Philistines: lest you come to be servants~
to the Hebrews, as they have served you: take courage and fight.
10 So the Philistines fought, and Israel was overthrown, and every man fled to~
his own dwelling: and there was an exceeding great slaughter; for there fell of~
Israel thirty thousand footmen.
11 And the ark of God was taken: and the two sons of Heli, Ophni and Phinees,~
were slain.

[Lectio4]
From the Sermons of St John Chrysostom Patriarch of Constantinople.
!both Homily to the people of Antioch.
His Word saith: "This is My Body." This we confess, and believe, and, with~
spiritual eyes, do see. Christ hath not left unto us Himself in such form as~
that we can see, hear, touch, smell, or taste Him and yet hath He left Himself~
unto us in things which we can see, hear, touch, smell, and taste, and which all~
men may understand. Thus also is it in baptism by mean of water, which men~
perceive outwardly, is given unto them a gift which they can grasp only inwardly,~
that is, a new birth. If we had no bodies, then would these things be given us~
without any outward and visible signs, but since we are here made up of souls~
and bodies, there are given unto our souls gifts which they can grasp, in~
outward signs which our bodies may perceive. How many there be which say I~
would that I could see His comely presence, His Face, His garments, even His~
shoes Behold, thou dost see and touch Him, yea, thou dost feed upon Him. And~
wouldest thou behold His raiment Lo, He hath given unto thee not only to~
behold it, but to feed upon it, and handle it, and take it into thyself.

At this table of the Lord let none dare to draw near with squeamishness or~
carelessness. Let all be fiery, all hot, all roused. To the Jews it was~
commanded touching the Paschal lamb, (Exod. xii. 11): "And thus shall ye eat it~
with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand~
and ye shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's Passover." But thou needest to~
be more watchful than they. They were just about to travel from Egypt to~
Palestine, and therefore they bore the guise of travellers but the journey~
that lieth before thee is from earth to heaven. And therefore it behoveth thee~
in all things to be on thy guard, for the punishment of him that eateth or~
drinketh unworthily is no light one (1 Cor. xi. 27.) Bethink thee how thou art~
indignant against him which betrayed, and them that crucified the Lord and~
look to it well that thou also be not " Guilty of the Body and Blood of the~
Lord." As for them, they slew His Most Holy Body but thou, after all that He~
hath done for thee, dost thrust Him into thy polluted soul. For His love, it was~
not enough to be made Man, to be buffeted, and to be crucified He hath also~
mingled Himself with us, by making us His Body, and that not by faith only, but~
verily and indeed.

Anything be purer than that man ought to be, who eateth of this great Sacrifice~
Can sun-beam be clearer than that hand ought to be which breaketh this Flesh?~
that mouth, which is filled with that spiritual fire? that tongue, which is~
reddened by that Blood, awful exceedingly? That whereon the Angels quail to look,~
neither dare to gaze steadfastly upon It, because of the blinding glory that~
shineth therefrom, upon This we feed, with This we become one, and are made one~
body of Christ, and one flesh. "Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord who~
can show forth all His praise?" (Ps. cv. 2.) Where is the shepherd which feedeth~
his flock with his own blood Nay, why should I say, shepherd Many mothers~
there be, who after all the pains of travail, give their own little ones to~
strangers to nurse. But so would not He, but feedeth us with His Own Blood, and~
maketh us to grow up in His Own substance.

From the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 14:16-24
At that time Jesus spake unto the Pharisees this parable A certain man made a~
great supper, and bade many. And so on.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory the Great.
!36th upon the Gospels.
Dearly beloved brethren, between the dainties of the body and the dainties of~
the mind there is this difference, that the dainties of the body, when we lack~
them, raise up a great hunger after them, and when we devour them, straightway~
our fulness worketh in us niceness. But about the dainties of the mind we are~
nice while as yet we lack them, and when we fill ourselves with them, then are~
we an-hungered after them, and the more, being an-hungered, we feed thereon, the~
more are we an-hungered thereafter. In the bodily dainties, the hunger is keener~
than the fulness, but in the spiritual the fulness is keener than the hunger. In~
the bodily, hunger gendereth fulness, and fulness niceness in the spiritual,~
hunger indeed gendereth fulness, but fulness gendereth hunger.

[Lectio8]
Scriptural dainties, in the very eating, do stir up the keenness of hunger in~
the mind which they fill, for, the more we taste their sweetness, the better we~
know how well they deserve to be loved and, if we taste them not, we cannot~
love them, for we know not how sweet they be. And who can love that whereof he~
knoweth nothing Hence saith the Psalmist " O taste and see that the Lord is~
good," (Ps. xxxiii. 9,) that is, as it were, " If ye taste not, ye shall not see~
His goodness but let your heart once taste the bread of life, and then indeed,~
having tasted and proved His sweetness, ye shall be able to love Him." But these~
were the dainties which man lost when he sinned in Eden, and when he had shut~
his own mouth against the sweet bread whereof if any man eat he shall live for~
ever, he forsook paradise.

[Lectio9]
And we that, from the first man, are born under the afflictions of this~
pilgrimage, are come into the world smitten with niceness we know not what we~
ought to want, and the disease of our niceness groweth the worse, as our soul~
draweth itself the more away from that bread of sweetness. We are no longer~
an-hungered after inward dainties, since we have lost the use of feeding on~
them. And so in our niceness we starve, and the sickness of long famishing~
maketh prey of our health. We will not eatof that inward sweetness which is~
made ready for us, and being enamoured only of things outward we sink into the~
wretchedness of loving starvation.

Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 14:16-24
14:16 But he said to him: A certain man made a great supper, and invited many.
14:17 And he sent his servant at the hour of supper to say to them that were invited, that they should come, for now all things are ready.
14:18 And they began all at once to make excuse. The first said to him: I have bought a farm, and I must needs go out and see it: I pray thee, hold me excused.
14:19 And another said: I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to try them: I pray thee, hold me excused.
14:20 And another said: I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.
14:21 And the servant returning, told these things to his lord. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant: Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the feeble, and the blind, and the lame.
14:22 And the servant said: Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room.
14:23 And the Lord said to the servant: Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.
14:24 But I say unto you, that none of those men that were invited, shall taste of my supper.
