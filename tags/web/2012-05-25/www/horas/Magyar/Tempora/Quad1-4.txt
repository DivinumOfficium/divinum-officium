Evangélium szent Máté könyvébõl
!Matt 15:21-28
Azon továbbmenve, Jézus Tírusz és Szidon vidékére vonult vissza. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Bk. ii. Comm. on Matth. xv.
Christ leaveth the Scribes and Pharisees who had spoken falsely against Him, and~
goeth into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, that He may heal the Tyrians and~
Sidonians. But a woman of Canaan cometh to Him out of the land He had left, and~
crieth to Him to give health to her daughter. Remark that the case of the~
daughter of this woman of Canaan is the fifteenth case of healing. Have mercy on~
me, O Lord, Thou Son of David! She knew that He was to be called Son of David~
because she was come out of His own country, and had left the errors of the~
Tyrians and Sidonians when she changed her home and her faith.

[Responsory1]
R. I had been troubled, but that I knew thy mercy, O Lord Thou hast said I~
have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that he turn from his way and~
live.
* O Thou, Who didst call the Canaanitish woman and the Publican unto repentance!
V. In the multitude of the sorrows within my heart, thy comforts delight my~
soul.
R. O Thou Who didst call the Canaanitish woman and the Publican unto repentance!

[Lectio2]
My daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. I think that the daughter of this~
woman of Canaan, (whom the Lord at length delivered,) was a figure of the souls~
of such as now believe, but were once grievously vexed by the devil, knowing not~
Him Who made them, and bowing down to stocks and stones. But He answered not a~
word not because He was puffed up with the pride of the Pharisees, or shared the~
high looks of the Scribes, but that He might fulfil His own word that He had~
spoken, saying Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the~
Samaritans enter ye not. (Matth. x. 5.) He would not give an occasion to such as~
spoke falsely against Him, and He kept back perfect salvation from the Gentiles~
until such time as He should have suffered and risen again.

And His disciples came and besought Him, saying Send her away; for she crieth~
after us. The disciples, knowing not as yet the mysterious things of the Lord,~
said this, either because they were moved with compassion and so interceded for~
this Canaanitish woman, whom another Evangelist calleth a Syrophcenician, (Mark~
vii. 26,) or because she was crying out that the Lord was an hard, instead of a~
merciful physician, and they desired to be rid of her clamour. But He answered~
and said I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel, not~
that He was not sent unto the Gentiles, but because it was to Israel in the~
first instance that He was sent, whom refusing the Gospel, He might justly pass~
away from, and go to the Gentiles.
