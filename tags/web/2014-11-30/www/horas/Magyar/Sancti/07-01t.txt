From the Sermons of St Maximus, Bishop of Turin.
!3rd for the Birth-day of St John the Baptist.
Dearly beloved brethren, the feast which we this day keep hath been hallowed by~
the true Birth of the worshipful Baptist, John. He was a man whom God was~
pleased to send into this world, not only that he himself might fill the~
glorious office of a Prophet, but also that by him the words of all the other~
Prophets might be established. That we should give him, as we now do, the~
chiefest honour among them all, is right for he had poured upon him this~
special blessing, that, being the last who prophesied in the world the coming of~
Him Who came to redeem the world, he was the first who, when He came, pointed to~
Him as already come. The other Prophets, at the distance of ages, knew that our~
Lord Jesus Christ was to come the Prophet John alone was worthy to see Him~
with his very eyes, and to proclaim Him actually present.

[Lectio5]
This is he concerning whom the seer Isaiah, by the inspiration of God, said: The~
voice of him that crieth in the wilderness Prepare ye the way of the Lord.~
~(xl. 3.) How meetly, dearly beloved brethren, is this blessed John called a~
voice he who was sent to be at once the herald and the witness of the Word from~
heaven This is he whose birth, whose name, and whose work were foretold by the~
angel Gabriel. This is he who in the sight of heavenly knowledge is more~
honourable than any other man, as hath been declared by the Lord Among them~
that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist.~
~(Matth. xi. 11.) How beautifully is it said, born of women  since He Who was~
infinitely greater than John was born of a Virgin 

[Lectio6]
In sight of these things, consider, dearly beloved brethren, in how great~
worship, in how great love ye are behoven to hold him, who is thus honourable,~
that he hath been foretold by the Holy Ghost, promised by an Angel, extolled by~
the Lord Himself, and hallowed by the everlasting glory of an holy death. His~
birth, surrounded with wonders, is the meet beginning of a wondrous life, that~
holy, sinless life the meet fore-runner of a death which was a gift to God. It~
is but just then, my brethren, that the Church of Christ should on this day with~
keen joy keep throughout the whole world the Feast of his Birth, even his, who~
arose a right faithful witness to tell a wondering world that a life of eternal~
gladness was lying open to the choice of dying creatures.

Evangélium szent Lukács Evangélista kőnyvéből
!Luke 1:57-65
Elérkezett Erzsébet szülésének ideje, és fiút szült. Amikor a szomszédok és rokonok meghallották, hogy milyen nagyra méltatta az Úr irgalmában, vele örültek. És így tovább.

Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop of Milan.
!Bk ii. on Luke i.
 He shall be called John. Elizabeth who had herself prophesied of Christ, could~
not fail to recognise the Fore-runner of the Lord. It is well added: There is~
none of thy kindred that is called by this name whereby we know that he was~
named, not as the son of Zacharias, but as the Prophet of God. And they made~
signs to his father, how he would have him called  but since unbelief had~
bereft him of voice and hearing, he was not able to answer them by word of mouth,~
and he asked for a writing-table and wrote, saying His name is John.

[Lectio8]
He asked for a writing-table and wrote, saying His name is John he giveth not~
this name to his son, but maketh known that it is already his. And his mouth was~
opened immediately unbelief had shut it, faith opened it. If, then, we likewise~
would speak, let us believe let our tongues, which unbelief hath tied, be~
opened to speak wisdom.

[Lectio9]
If we be fain to speak, let us engrave deep things upon our memories let us~
engrave the fact that Christ is at hand, not in tables of stone, but in fleshy~
tables of the heart. (2 Cor. iii. 3.) He that spake of John prophesied of~
Christ. Let us so speak of John, as to speak of Christ, that our mouth also may~
be opened, as was the mouth of the great Priest Zacharias which, like the mouth~
of a dumb beast constrained by the bit, was forced by a wavering faith to make~
voiceless signs.
