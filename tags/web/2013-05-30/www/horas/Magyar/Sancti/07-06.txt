[Versum 1]
V. Thou shalt make them princes over all the earth
R. They shall remember thy name, O Lord

[Ant 1]
Apostle Peter * and Paul Doctor of Gentiles, they taught us to your Law o Lord

[Oratio]
O God, Who didst hallow this day by the Testifying of thine Holy Apostles Peter~
and Paul, grant unto thy Church, whose foundations Thou wast pleased to lay by~
their hands, the grace always in all things to remain faithful to their~
teaching.
$Per Dominum

[Lectio4]
From the Sermons of St John Chrysostom, Patriarch of Constantinople.
!In the Metaphrastes.
The blessed Apostles, who have toiled so much for us, what thanks shall we give~
you When I remember thee, O Peter, I am lost in amazement Paul, when I think~
of thee, my heart overwhelmeth me, and I weep. When I look at your sufferings I~
know not what to say or what to speak. How many prisons have ye made holy How~
many fetters have ye made honourable? How many torments have ye endured How~
many reproaches have ye borne How have ye carried Christ How have ye made~
the Churches glad by your preaching? Verily, your tongues were blessed~
instruments it was for the Church's sake that your limbs were bloody. Ye have~
been made in all things followers of Christ. Your sound is gone out through all~
the earth, and your words to the ends of the world. (Ps. xviii. 4.)

[Lectio5]
Rejoice, O Peter, who hast been gladdened by the wood of the Cross of. Christ.,~
It was. a showing forth of thy Teacher that thou didst will to be crucified, not~
like the Lord Christ, standing upright, but with thine head toward the earth,~
as one that made a way from earth to heaven. Blessed are the nails which pierced~
thine holy, limbs. With sure and certain hope didst thou commend thy spirit into~
the hands of the Lord, thou who hadst been a faithful servant to Him and to His~
Bride the Church, thou who in thy warm heart hadst loved the Lord more loyally~
than all the Apostles.

[Lectio6]
Rejoice thou also, O blessed Paul, whose head was cut off by the sword, thou~
whose fearless devotion no words can express. What sword was that which divided~
thine holy neck, that instrument of the Lord's work, worthy that heaven should~
wonder at it, and earth worship it What place was that which drank in thy~
blood, that appeared like drops of milk upon the raiment of him who smote thee,~
and made the savage and his comrades to become strangely gentle and faithful~
Would that I could have that sword for a crown, and the nails of Peter set~
therein as the jewels of the diadem.

Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kõnyvébõl
!Matt 14:22-23
Azon idõben Jézus szólt a tanítványoknak, szálljanak bárkába, és evezzenek át a~
túlsó partra, addig õ hazaküldi a népet. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest at Bethlehem.
!Bk. ii. Comm. on Matth. xiv.
The Lord commanded His disciples to cross over to the other side, and~
constrained them to get into a ship. By these expressions we perceive that they~
were unwilling to leave the Lord, the love of their Teacher making them desire~
not to lose a moment of His company. And when He had sent the multitudes away,~
He went up into a mountain apart to pray. Perchance, if Peter, and James, and~
John, who had seen Him in the glory of the Transfiguration, had been with Him,~
they would have gone up into the mountain with Him, but the common herd could~
not follow Him, save when He taught them on the sea shore, or fed them in the~
wilderness.

[Lectio8]
He went up into a mountain apart to pray, not as He Who, with five loaves and~
two fishes, had satisfied about five thousand men, besides women and children,~
but as He, Who when He heard of the death of John, departed into a desert place~
apart (vv. 12-21.) Not that we make two Persons in the Lord but some of His~
works He did as God, and some as man. But the ship was now in the midst of the~
sea, tossed with waves. The Apostles were right to be slow and unwilling to~
leave the Lord, for, when He was not with them, they were in peril of shipwreck.

[Lectio9]
Thilst the Lord abode alone upon the top of the mountain, a contrary wind arose,~
and the sea raged, and the Apostles were endangered and yet the threatening~
shipwreck held off until Jesus came. And in the fourth watch of the night, Jesus~
went unto them, walking on the sea. The watches of soldiers are divided into~
three. When therefore it is said that the Lord came unto them in the fourth~
watch, it appeareth that they had been in peril all night, and that it was at~
the end of the night, as it will again be at the end of the world, that He came~
to the rescue of His disciples.

[Versum 2]
V. Their sound hath gone forth into all the earth:
R. And their words unto the ends of the world.

[Ant 2]
Glorious princes * of the Earth, as in this life you were honored together, you~
are not separated by death

[Versum 3]
V. Thou shalt make them princes over all the earth
R. They shall remember thy name, O Lord

[Ant 3]
Petrus Apostolus * et Paulus Doctor Gentium, ipsi nos docuerunt legem tuam~
Domine.
