!Luke 14:1-11
At that time: As Jesus went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees, to eat~
bread on the Sabbath-day, they watched Him. And, behold, there was a certain man~
before Him, which had the dropsy. And so on.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!Bk. vii. on Luke xiv.
Now is healed this man sick of the dropsy, in whom too much watery matter had~
well-nigh drowned the functions of life, and quenched the fire of understanding.~
Anon, a lesson is given in lowly-mindedness, when it is forbidden to the guests~
at a marriage feast to go and sit down unasked in the highest room, albeit the~
Lord spake gently, that the teaching of courtesy might forestall a harsh rebuke,~
reason prevail by dint of persuasion, and the desires be bent to follow the~
instruction. And upon this, as nextdoor neighbour, cometh courtesy, which is so~
called by the Lord, when it is shown to the poor and weak, since to show it to~
them from whom we are to receive aught, is but a movement of self-interest.

[Lectio8]
Lastly, as to a soldier that hath served his full time, is apportioned a reward~
for esteeming lightly of riches so he only can inherit the kingdom of God,~
whose soul is not given to seek after lower ends, and who purchaseth not to~
himself earthly possessions whereas the Lord saith " Sell that thou hast,~
and follow Me." (Matth. xix. 21.) Neither can he gain it that buyeth oxen, which~
beasts Elisha slew and gave unto the people. (3 Kings xix. 21.) Neither can he~
win it which hath married a wife and therefore cannot come, for " he that is~
unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the~
Lord but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how~
he may please his wife." (1 Cor. vii. 32, 33.) Not that this is to be taken for~
blame of marriage, but only that virginity is the more honourable way, since "~
the unmarried woman " and the widow "careth for the things of the Lord, that~
she may be holy both in body and in spirit." (34-)

[Lectio9]
But in all fairness, having thus spoken concerning widows, let us betake~
ourselves again among the married, and join with them in entertaining the~
opinion which is held by so many, that there are only three classes of men who~
are shut out from the great supper named in the gospel, which three classes are~
Heathens, Jews, and Heretics. And therefore it is that the Apostle warneth us~
that we "walk not as other Gentiles walk," in malice and bitterness, and~
uncleanness, and covetousness, and so have no entry into the kingdom of Christ,~
since "no unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any~
inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God." (Eph. iv. 17, v. 5.)

[Ant 2]
As Jesus went into the house * of one of the chief Pharisees, to eat bread on~
the Sabbath Day, behold, there was a certain man before Him which had the dropsy~
and He took him, and healed him, and let him go.

[Versum 2]
V. The Lord reigneth He is clothed with majesty.
R. The Lord is clothed with strength, and hath girded Himself with power.

[Ant 3]
When thou art bidden * of any man to a wedding, go and sit down in the lowest~
room, that he that bade thee may say Friend, go up higher, then shalt thou~
have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee. Alleluia.

[Versum 3]
V. Let my prayer, O Lord, be set forth.
R. As incense before thee.
