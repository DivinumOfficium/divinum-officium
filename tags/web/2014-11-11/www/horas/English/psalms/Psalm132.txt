132:1 (A gradual canticle of David.) Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity:
132:2 Like the precious ointment on the head, that ran down upon the beard, the beard of Aaron, Which ran down to the skirt of his garment:
132:3 As the dew of Hermon, which descendeth upon mount Sion. For there the Lord hath commanded blessing, and life for evermore.
