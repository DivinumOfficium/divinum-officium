Olvasmány szent Pál apostol Korintusiakhoz irott második leveléből
!2 Cor. 10:17-18; 11:1-2
v. De "aki dicsekszik, az Úrban dicsekedjék."  Nem az a megbízható, aki magát ajánlja, hanem akit az Úr ajánl.  Bárcsak eltűrnétek részemről egy kis balgaságot!  De hiszen meg is teszitek. Én Isten féltékenységével féltelek titeket. Mert eljegyeztelek benneteket egy férfival, hogy tiszta szűzként vezesselek el Krisztushoz. 

[Graduale]

In your splendor and your beauty ride on triumphant, and reign.

V. Behind her the virgins of her train are brought to the King. They are borne~
in to You with gladness. Alleluia.

v. A mennyek országa hasonlít a tíz szűzhöz, akik fogták lámpásukat, és a vőlegény elé mentek.  Öt balga volt közülük, öt pedig okos.  A balgák lámpásukat ugyan elvitték, de olajat nem vittek bele.
