Olvasmány szent Pál apostol Rómaiakhoz írott leveléből
!Rom 4:1-8
1 Kérdezzük csak, mit ért el Ábrahám, testi ősatyánk. 
2 Ha ugyanis Ábrahám tettei révén igazult meg, akkor volna dicsekednivalója, csak nem Isten előtt. 
3 Mert mit is mond az Írás: "Ábrahám hitt az Istennek, és ez megigazulására szolgált." 
4 Márpedig aki tetteket mutat fel, annak a bér nem kegyelemből, hanem tartozás címén jár. 
5 Aki ellenben tetteket nem visz végbe, hanem hisz abban, aki a bűnöst igazzá teszi, annak a hite számítódik be megigazulására. 
6 Ilyen alapon már Dávid is boldognak mondja az embert, akit Isten tesz igazzá tettek nélkül: 
7 Boldog, akinek a bűne megbocsátva, akinek be van födve gonoszsága. 
8 Boldog ember, akinek az Úr vétkeit fel nem rója. 

[Responsory1]
R. Behold the Lamb of God, behold Him Which taketh away the sins of the world;~
behold Him of Whom I said unto you He That cometh after me is preferred before~
me
* Whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.
V. He that is of the earth speaketh of the earth; He That cometh from heaven is~
above all.
R. Whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.

[Lectio2]
!Rom 4:9-12
9 Vajon e boldogsághoz csak a körülmetélt juthat hozzá vagy a körülmetéletlen is? Ezt mondjuk ugyanis: Ábrahámnak a hite szolgált megigazulására. 
10 De hogyan szolgált? Körülmetélt vagy körülmetéletlen állapotban? Nem körülmetélt, hanem körülmetéletlen állapotban. 
11 A körülmetélés jelét mint a körülmetéletlenségben nyert hitbeli megigazulás pecsétjét azért kapta, hogy atyja legyen minden körülmetéletlen hívőnek, hadd legyen nekik is részük a megigazulásban, és hogy atyja legyen a körülmetélteknek is. 
12 Tehát nem csupán a körülmetélteknek, hanem azoknak is, akik a még körülmetéletlen atyánk, Ábrahám hitének nyomán járnak. 

[Responsory2]
R. This day which is breaking is holy O come, ye Gentiles, and worship the~
Lord.
* For this day is much light come down unto us from heaven.
V. This is the day which the Lord hath made, let us rejoice and be glad in it.
R. For this day is much light come down unto us from heaven.

[Lectio3]
!Rom 4:13-17
13 Az az ígéret ugyanis, hogy Ábrahám és utódai öröklik a világot, nem a törvénnyel, hanem a hitbeli megigazulással kapcsolatban hangzott el. 
14 Mert ha a törvény alá rendeltek az örökösök, akkor a hit hiábavaló, az ígéret pedig érdektelen. 
15 A törvény ugyanis büntetésre szolgáltat alkalmat. Ahol nincs törvény, törvényszegés sincs. 
16 Tehát azért hitből, hogy ugyanakkor kegyelemből is legyen. Így lesz az ígéret minden utód számára biztos, nemcsak azok számára, akik alá vannak vetve a törvénynek, hanem azok számára is, akik Ábrahám hitéből valók. Ő mindnyájunknak atyja 
17 Isten előtt, ahogyan az Írás mondja róla: "Sok nép atyjává rendeltelek." Mert hitt abban, aki életre kelti a halottakat, és létre hívja a nem létezőket. 

[Responsory3]
R. Blessed be He That cometh in the name of the Lord! God is the Lord Which hath~
showed us light.
* Alleluia, Alleluia.
V. This is the day v/hich the Lord hath made, let us rejoice and be glad in it.
R. Alleluia, Alleluia.
&Gloria
R. Alleluia, Alleluia.

From the Sermons of Pope St Leo (the Great.)
!7th for Christmas
Dearly beloved brethren, whosoever will keep truly and honour piously this day's~
festival, it is necessary for him neither to think falsely of the Lord's~
Incarnation, nor meanly of the Lord's Godhead. For as there is danger, on the~
one hand, of denying the truth of Christ's participation of our nature, so is~
there no less danger, on the other, of doing despite to the equality of His~
glory with the glory of the Father. Wherefore, when we draw near to understand~
the mystery of Christ's Birth, wherein He was born of the Virgin Mary, we must~
leave the clouds of earthly imagination behind and pierce the fog of human~
wisdom with the eye of enlightened faith.

[Responsory4]
R. Rejoice with me, all ye that love the Lord.
* For while I was yet little I pleased the Most High, and from my womb have I~
brought forth God and man.
V. All generations shall call me blessed, for God hath regarded the lowliness of~
His hand-maiden.
R. For while I was yet little I pleased the Most High, and from my womb have I~
brought forth God and man.

[Lectio5]
The authority on which we believe is the authority of God Himself; the teaching~
which we follow is the teaching of God Himself. Wherefore whether we lend the~
ear of our mind to the testimony of the Law, or to the revelations of the~
Prophets, or to the full pealing of the Gospel trumpet, that is true, which John~
the Son of Thunder, uttered, when he was filled with the Holy Ghost, and said~
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.~
The Same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without~
Him was not anything made. True also is his witness when he saith The Word was~
made Flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the~
Only-begotten of the Father. (John i. 1-3, 14.)

[Responsory5]
R. The heart of the Virgin was fixed, when the Angel declared unto her the~
mystery of God and she conceived then did she receive in her pure womb Him~
That is fairer than the children of men.
* And, she that is blessed for ever, brought forth for us God and man.
V. Soon rises, in that modest shrine, The Temple of the Lord Divine The~
stainless and unwedded one, Within her womb conceived the Son.
R. And, she that is blessed for ever, brought forth for us God and man.

[Lectio6]
The Person of the Son of God therefore remaineth unchanged and one, though He~
have two natures, keeping His own, and taking ours. He appeareth as man to be~
the restorer of men, but abideth all the while in His immutable Godhead. That~
Godhead which He shareth with the Father was not a whit the less Almighty, nor~
did the form of a servant touch the form of God to derogate from it. The Most~
High and Everlasting Being, bending down for man's salvation, took the Manhood~
into His glory; He ceased not to be That which He is from everlasting. Hence we~
see the Only-begotten Son of God in one place confessing that the Father is~
greater than He, (John xiv. 28,) and in another declaring that He and the Father~
are One, (x. 30.) This is an evident proof of the distinction of His two natures,~
and the unity of His Person; for He is inferior to the Father as touching His~
Manhood, and yet equal to the Father as touching His Godhead, and yet, though He~
be God and Man, He is not two, but One Christ.

[Responsory6]
R. Blessed and worshipful art thou, O Virgin Mary; from thee, still maiden~
undefiled, the Saviour came a little Child.
* He Whose glory filled the heavens lay in a manger.
V. O Lord, I have heard thy speech and was afraid; I considered thy works and~
trembled. O Thou (That dwellest) between the two living creatures!
R. He Whose glory filled the heavens lay in a manger.
&Gloria
R. He Whose glory filled the heavens lay in a manger.

Evangélium szent Lukács Evangélista kőnyvéből
!Luke 2:21
Azon időben amikor eltelt a nyolc nap és körülmetélték, a Jézus nevet adták neki, ahogy az angyal nevezte. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!Book ii. on Luke ii.
So the Child is circumcised. This is the Child of Whom it is said Unto us a~
Child is born, unto us a Son is given, (Isa. ix. 6.) Made under the law to~
redeem them that were under the law. (Gal. iv. 4.) To present Him to the Lord,~
~(22.) In my Commentary on Isaiah I have already explained what is meant by being~
presented to the Lord in Jerusalem, and therefore I will not enter into the~
subject again. He that is circumcised in heart gaineth the protection of God,~
for the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous. (Ps. xxxiii. 16.) Ye will see~
that as all the ceremonies of the old law were types of realities in the new, so~
the circumcision of the body signified the cleansing of the heart from the guilt~
of sin.

[Responsory7]
R. O Mary, how holy and how spotless is thy virginity! I am too dull to praise~
thee
* For thou hast borne in thy breast Him Whom the heavens cannot contain.
V. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.
R. For thou hast borne in thy breast Him Whom the heavens cannot contain.

[Lectio8]
But since the body and mind of man remain yet infected with a proneness' to sin,~
the circumcision of the eighth day is also a type of that complete cleansing~
from sin which we shall have at the resurrection. This ceremony was also~
performed in obedience to the commandment of God: Every male that openeth the~
womb shall be called holy unto the Lord. These words were written with especial~
reference to the delivery of the Blessed Virgin. Truly He That opened her womb~
was holy, for He was altogether without spot, and we may gather that the law was~
written specially for Him from the words of the Angel That Holy Thing Which~
shall be born of thee, shall be called the Son of God.

[Responsory8]
R. The Virgin-Mother that knew not a man, bore, but travailed not.
* She fed the Saviour of the world, The King of Angel hosts above, Jesus, our~
Redeemer blest, From the fountain of her breast.
V. Soon rises in that modest shrine, The Temple of the Lord Divine; The~
stainless and unwedded one, Within her womb conceived the Son.
R. She fed the Saviour of the world, The King of Angel hosts above, Jesus, our~
Redeemer blest, From the fountain of her breast.
&Gloria
R. She fed the Saviour of the world, The King of Angel hosts above, Jesus, our~
Redeemer blest, From the fountain of her breast.

[Lectio9]
Among all that are born of women the Lord Jesus Christ stood alone in holiness.~
Fresh from His immaculate Birth, He felt no contagion from human corruption, and~
His heavenly Majesty drove it away. If we are to follow the letter and say that~
every male that openeth the womb is holy, how shall we explain that so many have~
been unrighteous? Was Ahab holy? Were the false prophets holy? Were they holy on~
whom Elijah justly called down fire from heaven? But He to Whom the sacred~
commandment of the law of God is mystically directed is the Holy One of Israel;~
Who also alone hath opened the secret womb of His holy Virginbride the Church,~
filling her with a sinless fruitfulness to give birth to Christian souls.
