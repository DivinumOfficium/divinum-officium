Festum Domini

[Ant Vespera]
Who is this that * cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this, that is glorious in His apparel?
I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.
He was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God.
Wherefore art Thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the wine-fat?
I have trodden the wine - press alone, and of the people there was none with Me.

[Capitulum Vespera]
!Heb 9:11-12
v. Krisztus azonban a ránk váró javak fõpapjaként jött el, s belépett abba a nagyobb és tökéletesebb sátorba, amelyet nem ember keze alkotott, vagyis nem ebbõl a világból való. Nem a bakok vagy borjak vérével, hanem saját vérével lépett be egyszer s mindenkorra a szentélybe, és örök megváltást szerzett.

[Hymnus Vespera]
v. With glad and joyous strains now let each street resound,
And let the laurel wreath each Christian brow entwine;
With torches waving bright, let old and young go forth,
And swell the train in solemn line.
_
Whilst we with bitter tears, with sighs and grief profound,
Wail o'er the saving blood, poured forth upon the tree,
Oh, deeply let us muse, and count the heavy price,
Which Christ hath paid to make us free.
_
The primal man of old, who fell by serpent's guile,
Brought death and many woes upon his fallen race;
But our new Adam, Christ, new life unto us gave,
And brought to all ne'er-ending grace.
_
To heaven's highest height, the wailing cry went up
Of him, who hung in pain, God's own eternal Son;
His saving, priceless blood, his Father's wrath appeased,
And for his sons full pardon won.
_
Whoe'er in that pure blood his guilty soul shall wash,
Shall from his stains be freed be made as roses bright
Shall vie with angels pure, shall please his King and Lord,
And precious shine in his glad sight.
_
Oh, from the path of right ne'er let thy steps depart,
But haste thee to the goal in virtue's peaceful ways;
thy God who reigns on high will e'er direct thy steps,
And crown thy deeds with blissful days.
_
Father of all things made, to us propitious be,
For whom thy own dear Son, his saving blood did spill;
O Holy Spirit, grant the souls by thee refreshed
Eternal bliss may ever fill.
Amen.

[Versum 1]
V. Being justified by the Blood of Christ
R. We shall be saved from wrath through Him.

[Ant 1]
Ye are come * unto Mount Sion and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to Jesus the Mediator of the New Covenant, and to the Blood of sprinkling That speaketh better things than that of Abel

[Oratio]
Almighty and Everlasting God, Who hast appointed thine Only -begotten Son to be the Redeemer of the world, and hast been pleased to be reconciled unto us by His Blood,grant us, we beseech thee, so to use this solemn worship of the price of our salvation, that the Power thereof may here on earth keep us from all things that may hurt us, and the purchase of the same may gladden us for ever hereafter in Heaven.

Christ the Son of God hath redeemed us by His Own Blood.* O come, let us worship Him.

[Hymnus Matutinum]
He who once, in righteous vengeance,
Whelmed the world beneath the Flood,
Once again in mercy cleansed it
With the stream of His own Blood,
_
Coming from His throne on high
On the painful Cross to die.
Blest with this all-saving shower,
Earth her beauty straight resumed;
_
In the place of thorns and briars,
Myrtics sprang, and roses bloomed:
Bitter wormwood of the waste
Into honey changed its taste.
_
Scorpions ceased; the slimy serpent
Laid his deadly poison by;
Savage beasts of cruel instinct
Lost their wild ferocity;
_
Welcoming the gentle reign
Of the Lamb for sinners slain.
Oh, the wisdom of th' eternal!
Oh, its depth and height divine!
_
Oh, the sweetness of that mercy
Which in Jesus Christ doth shine!
Slaves we were condemned to die!
Our King pays the penalty!
_
When before the Judge we tremble,
Conscious of His broken laws,
May this Blood, in that dread hour,
Cry aloud, and plead our cause;
_
Bid our guilty terrors cease,
Be out- pardon and our peace.
Prince and Author of Salvation!
Lord of majesty supreme!
_
Jesu, praise to thee be given
By the world Thou didst redeem;
Who with the Father and the Spirit,
Reignest in eternal merit.
Ámen.

Olvasmány szent Pál apostol Zsidókhoz irott levelébõl
!Heb 9:11-15
11 Krisztus azonban a ránk váró javak fõpapjaként jött el, s belépett abba a nagyobb és tökéletesebb sátorba, amelyet nem ember keze alkotott, vagyis nem ebbõl a világból való.
12 Nem a bakok vagy borjak vérével, hanem saját vérével lépett be egyszer s mindenkorra a szentélybe, és örök megváltást szerzett.
13 Ha ugyanis a bakok és bikák vére meg az üszõ hamva a tisztátalanokra hintve külsõleg tisztává teszi õket,
14 mennyivel inkább megtisztítja lelkiismeretünket a holt cselekedetektõl Krisztus vére, aki az örök Lélek által saját magát adta tiszta áldozatul az Istennek, hogy az élõ Istennek szolgáljunk.
15 Ezért õ új szövetség közvetítõje. Elõbb azonban a régi szövetség korában elkövetett bûnök megváltásáért el kellett szenvednie a halált, hogy a meghívottak elnyerjék az örökké tartó örökséget.

[Responsory1]
R. Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people with His own Blood, suffered without the gate.
* Let us go forth therefore unto Him without the camp, bearing His reproach.
V. Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.
R. Let us go forth therefore unto Him without the gate, bearing His reproach.

[Lectio2]
!Heb 9:16-22
16 Ahol ugyanis van végrendelet, elõbb bizonyítani kell a végrendelkezõ halálát,
17 hiszen a végrendelet csak halál esetén jogerõs; addig, amíg a végrendelkezõ él, nem érvényes.
18 Ezért az elsõ szövetséget sem kötötték vér nélkül.
19 Miután ugyanis Mózes - a törvény elõírása szerint - minden rendelkezést felolvasott az egész nép elõtt, vette a bakok és borjak vérét a vízzel, majd vörös gyapjúval és izsóppal meghintette magát a könyvet és az egész népet,
20 e szavakkal: "Ez annak a szövetségnek a vére, amelyet az Isten veletek kötött."
21 Azután meghintette vérrel a sátort és az összes istentiszteleti edényt is.
22 Sõt a törvény szerint majdnem mindent vérrel tisztítanak meg, és vérontás nélkül nincs bûnbocsánat.

[Responsory2]
R. Moses took the blood, and sprinkled all the people
* Saying This is the blood of the Testament which God hath enjoined unto you.
V. Through faith he kept the Passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the first-born should touch them.
R. Saying This is the blood of the Testament which God hath enjoined unto you.

!Heb 10:19-24
19 Testvérek, Krisztus véréért megvan tehát a reményünk, hogy beléphetünk a szentélybe.
20 Ezt az élethez vezetõ új utat a függönyön, vagyis saját testén keresztül nyitotta meg nekünk.
21 Fõpapunk is van, akit az Isten a népe fölé rendelt.
22 Járuljunk hát hozzá igaz szívvel, hitbõl fakadó bizalommal, hiszen a szívünk megtisztult a rossz lelkiismerettõl, és testünket is tiszta víz mosta le.
23 Tartsunk ki rendíthetetlenül reménységünk megvallásában, mert hûséges az, aki az ígéretet tette.
24 Legyen gondunk rá, hogy szeretetre és jótettekre buzdítsuk egymást.

[Responsory3]
R. Ye, who sometimes were far off, are made nigh by the Blood of Christ.
* For He is our Peace, Who hath made both one.
V. It pleased [the Father that in Him should all fulness dwell, and,] having made peace through the Blood of His Cross, by Him to reconcile all things unto Himself, [by Him, I say,] whether they be things in earth or things in heaven.
R. For He is our Peace, Who hath made both one.

Sermo sancti Joannis Chrysostomi.
!Homilia 84. in Joannem, cap. 19.
From the Sermons of St John Chrysostom, Archbishop of Constantinople.
!Homilia 84. in Joannem, cap. 19.
Wouldest thou hear the power of the Blood of Christ? Then let us look at the figure thereof, let us call to mind the old type, and tell the story written in the antient Scriptures. The Egyptians would not let God take away Israel His firstborn, And Moses said Thus saith the Lord About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt, and all the first-born in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne unto the first-born of the maid-servant that is behind the mill, and all the first-born of beasts. And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more. But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast that ye may know how that the Lord hath put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel. (Ex. xi. 4-7.) Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families and kill the~
Passover. And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side-posts with the blood.. and when He seeth the blood upon the lintel and on the two side-posts, the Lord will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you. (xii. 21-23.) And could the blood of a sheep save a man Yea, in good sooth not because it was blood, but because it represented in a figure the Blood of the Lord.

[Responsory4]
R. Pass the time of your sojourning here in fear forasmuch as
* Ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold
V. But with the Precious Blood of Christ, as of a lamb without spot.
R. Ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold.

[Lectio5]
The statues of monarchs, mindless and speechless images though they be, have sometimes been an helpful refuge to men endowed with soul and reason, not because they are works of the brazier's skill, but because the likeness they bear is a King's. And just so did this unconscious blood deliver the lives of men, not because it was blood, but because it foreshadowed the shedding of the Blood of Jesus. On that night in Egypt, when the destroying Angel saw the blood upon the lintel and on the two side-posts, he passed over the door, and came not in unto the house. Even so now much more will the destroyer of souls flee away when he seeth, not the lintel and the two side-posts sprinkled with the blood of a lamb, but the mouth of the faithful Christian, the living dwelling of the Holy Ghost, shining with the blood of the True Messiah. If the Angel let the type be, how shall not the enemy quail before the Reality Wouldest thou hear more of the power of that Blood I am willing. Consider from what source it welleth, from what fountain it springeth. Its fountain is the Heart of the Lord, pierced for us upon the Cross. Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with Him but when they came to Jesus, and saw that He was dead already, they brake not His Legs, but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced His Side, and forthwith came thereout Blood and Water, (John xix, 32-34,) whereof One is a figure of Baptism, and the other of the Sacrament (of the Altar.) One of the soldiers with a spear pierced His Side the veil of the Temple of His Body was rent in twain. (John ii. 19-21, Matth. xxvii. 51.) O how glorious is the treasure that is laid open to me therein How noble the riches that it is my joy there to have found!

[Responsory5]
R. Ye are bought with a great price, therefore
* Glorify God and bear Him in your body.
V. Ye are bought with a price be not ye the servants of men.
R. Glorify God and bear Him in your body.

[Lectio6]
And so was it done concerning that Lamb : the Jews killed a sheep, and I have learned the value of the sacrament.  From the Side flowed forth Blood and Water.  I would not, O my hearer, that thou shouldest pass by the depths of such a mystery as this without pausing ; for I have yet a mystic and mysterious discourse to deliver.  I have said that the Water and Blood shewed forth symbolically baptism and the sacraments.  For from these, holy Church was founded by the laver of regeneration, and the renovation of the Holy Ghost.  Through baptism, I say, and through the sacraments, which seem to have issued from his Side.  It was therefore out of the Side of Christ that the Church was created, just as it was out of the side of Adam that Eve was raised up to be his bride.  This is the reason why Paul saith, no doubt in allusion to his Side : We are members of his Body, and of his bones.  For even as God made the woman Eve out of the rib which he had taken out of the side of Adam, so hath Christ made the Church out of the Blood and Water which he made to flow for us out of his own Side. - On the occasion of the nineteenth centenary of the accomplishment of the redemption of mankind, as a fitting celebration of this ineffable blessing, Pope Pius XI decreed an extraordinary Jubilee.  During that year the Supreme Pontiff, wishing that the fruits of the Precious Blood of Christ, the Lamb without spot, might redound more abundantly upon mankind and that the minds of the faithful be impressed with more vivid recollections of this same Blood as the price of their redemption, elevated the Feast of the Most Precious Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ to the rank of a double of the first class, to be celebrated as such every year by the universal Church.

[Responsory6]
R. God commendeth His love toward us
* In that, while we were yet sinners, in due time Christ died for us.
V. Much more then being now justified by His Blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.
R. In that, while we were yet sinners, in due time Christ died for us.
&Gloria
R. In that, while we were yet sinners, in due time Christ died for us.

Evangélium szent János Apostol kõnyvébõl
!John 19:30-35
Azon idõben amint Jézus megízlelte az ecetet, így szólt: "Beteljesedett!" Aztán lehajtotta fejét és kilehelte lelkét. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop of Hippo.
!120th Tract on John.
 One of the soldiers with a spear pierced His Side, and forthwith came thereout~
Blood and Water. The Evangelist speaketh carefully. He saith not that he smote the Side, nor yet that he wounded It, nor yet anything else, but pierced pierced It, to fling wide the entrance unto life, whence flow the Sacraments of the Church, those Sacraments without which there is no entrance unto the life which is life indeed. That Blood which was shed there was shed for the remission of sins, that Water is the water that mantleth in the cup of salvation. Therein are we washed, and thereof do we drink. Of this was it a type when it was said unto Noah The door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof.. and of every living thing of all flesh shalt thou bring into the ark.. to keep them alive. (Gen. vi. 16, 19.) A figure this of the Church. Thus was it that the first woman was made from the side of her husband while he slept, and she was called (Eve, which is, being interpreted,) Life, because she was the mother of all living. (Gen. iii. 20.) This name set forth a great good, before it became associated with the bitter fruit of a great evil. And here we have the Second Adam bowing His Head, and the deep sleep of death falling upon Him upon the Cross, and He sleepeth, that the Lord God may take a thing out of His side, and may make thereof a wife for Him. O what a death was His, which quickeneth the dead What is cleaner than His Blood What more health-giving than His wounding

[Responsory7]
R. This is He That came by Water and Blood, even Jesus Christ
* Not by Water only, but by Water and Blood.
V. In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness.
R. Not by Water only, but by Water and Blood.

[Lectio8]
Then were being held bondsmen to the devil, slaves to evil spirits. But they have been redeemed from that bondage. They had been able to sell themselves, but they were not able to redeem themselves. A Redeemer came and paid the price for them. He shed His Blood, and at that cost bought the world. Ye ask what He bought Look what He paid, and ye shall see what He bought. Christ's Blood was the price. What is His Blood worth? What, but the whole world What but all men They are very unthankful for His redemption, or very proud, who say that It is only precious enough to buy the Africans, or that they themselves are so precious that It was shed only for them. Let there be an end to such conceit, an end to such vainglory. What He paid, He paid for all.

[Responsory8]
R. God hath predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ
* In Whom we have redemption through His Blood.
V. The forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace, wherein He hath abounded toward us.
R. In Whom we have redemption through His Blood.
&Gloria
R. In Whom we have redemption through His Blood.

[Lectio9]
Habuit ille sanguinem, unde nos redimeret; et ad hoc accepit sanguinem, ut esset quem pro nobis redimendis effunderet. Sanguis Domini tui, si vis, datus est pro te. Forte enim dicis: Habuit sanguinem Deus meus, quo me redimeret, sed jam, cum passus est, totum dedit; quid illi remansit, quod det et pro me? Hos est magnum, quia semel dedit, et pro omnibus dedit. Sanguis Christi volenti est salus, nolenti supplicium. Quid ergo dubitas, qui mori non vis, a secunda potius morte liberari? Quia liberaris, si vis tollere crucem tuam, et sequi Dominum; qui ille tulit suam et quaesivit servum

What are these * which are arrayed in white robes? And whence came they?

HAIL, holy Wounds of Jesus, hail,
Sweet pledges of the saving Rood,
Whence flow the streams that never fall,
The purple streams of Ills dear Blood.
_
Brighter than brightest stars ye show,
Than sweetest rose your scent more rare,
No Indian gem may match your glow,
No honey's taste with yours corn. pare.
_
Portals ye are to that dear home
Wherein our wearied souls may hide,
Whereto no angry foe can come,
The Heart of Jesus crucified.
_
What countless stripes our Jesus bore,
All naked left in Pilate's hail
From His torn flesh how red a shower
Did round His sacred person fall!
_
His beauteous brow, oh, shame and grief,
By the sharp thorny crown is riven;
Through hands and feet, without relief,
The cruel nails are rudely driven.
_
But when for our poor sakes He died,
A willing Priest by love subdued,
The soldier's lance transfixed His side,
Forth flowed the Water and the Blood.
_
In full atonement of our guilt,
Careless of self, the Saviour trod
E'en till His Heart's best Bloodwas spilt
The winepress of the wrath of God.
_
Come, bathe you in the healing flood,
All ye who mourn, by sin opprest;
Your only hope is Jesus' Blood,
His Sacred Heart your only rest.
_
All praise to Him, the Eternal Son,
At God's right hand enthroned above,
Whose Blood our full redemption won,
Whose Spirit seals the gift of love.
Ámen.
