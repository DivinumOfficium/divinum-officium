!1 Mac 5:55-58
55  Now in the days that Judas and Jonathan were in the land of Galaad, and Simon his brother in Galilee before Ptolemais,
56  Joseph the son of Zacharias, and Azarias captain of the soldiers, heard of the good success, and the battles that were fought.
57  And he said: Let us also get us a name, and let us go fight against the Gentiles that are round about us.
58  And he gave charge to them that were in his army, and they went towards Jamnia.

!1 Mac 5:59-62
59  And Gorgias and his men went out of the city, to give them battle.
60  And Joseph and Azarias were put to flight, and were pursued unto the borders of Judea: and there fell, on that day, of the people of Israel about two thousand men, and there was a great overthrow of the people:
61  Because they did not hearken to Judas, and his brethren, thinking that they should do manfully.
62  But they were not of the seed of those men by whom salvation was brought to Israel.

!1 Mac 5:63-67
63  And the men of Juda were magnified exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and of all the nations where their name was heard.
64  And people assembled to them with joyful acclamations.
65  Then Judas and his brethren went forth and attacked the children of Esau, in the land toward the south, and he took Chebron, and her towns: and he burnt the walls thereof and the towers all round it.
66  And he removed his camp to go into the land of the aliens, and he went through Samaria.
67  In that day some priests fell in battle, while desiring to do manfully they went out unadvisedly to fight.
