will sing to the Lord, who giveth me good things:

[Oratio]
O God, the Strength of all them that put their trust in thee, mercifully accept~
our prayers, and because through the weakness of our mortal nature we can do no~
good thing without thee, grant us the help of thy grace, that in keeping of thy~
commandments we may please thee, both in will and deed.

[Lectio]
Lesson from the first letter of St John the Apostle
!1 John 4:8-21
v. Dearly beloved: He that loveth not, knoweth not God: for God is charity. By this hath the charity of God appeared towards us, because God hath sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we may live by him. In this is charity: not as though we had loved God, but because he hath first loved us, and sent his Son to be a propitiation for our sins. My dearest, if God hath so loved us; we also ought to love one another. No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God abideth in us, and his charity is perfected in us. In this we know that we abide in him, and he in us: because he hath given us of his spirit. And we have seen, and do testify, that the Father hath sent his Son to be the Saviour of the world. Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth in him, and he in God. And we have known, and have believed the charity, which God hath to us. God is charity: and he that abideth in charity, abideth in God, and God in him. In this is the charity of God perfected with us, that we may have confidence in the day of judgment: because as he is, we also are in this world. Fear is not in charity: but perfect charity casteth out fear, because fear hath pain. And he that feareth, is not perfected in charity. Let us therefore love God, because God first hath loved us. If any man say, I love God, and hateth his brother; he is a liar. For he that loveth not his brother, whom he seeth, how can he love God, whom he seeth not? And this commandment we have from God, that he, who loveth God, love also his brother.

!Ps 40:5; 40:2
v. I said: O Lord, be thou merciful to me : heal my soul, for I have sinned~
against thee. Blessed is he that understandeth concerning the needy and the poor :~
the Lord will deliver him in the evil day. Allelúja, allelúja
!Ps 5:2
v. Give ear, O Lord, to my words, understand my cry. Allelúja.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 6:36-42
v. In that time Jesus said to his disciples: Be ye therefore merciful, as your~
Father also is merciful. Judge not, and you shall not be judged. Condemn not,~
and you shall not be condemned. Forgive, and you shall be forgiven. Give, and it~
shall be given to you: good measure and pressed down and shaken together and~
running over shall they give into your bosom. For with the same measure that you~
shall mete withal, it shall be measured to you again. And he spoke also to them a~
similitude: Can the blind lead the blind? do they not both fall into the ditch?~
The disciple is not above his master: but every one shall be perfect, if he be~
as his master. And why seest thou the mote in thy brother's eye: but the beam~
that is in thy own eye thou considerest not? Or how canst thou say to thy~
brother: Brother, let me pull the mote out of thy eye, when thou thyself seest~
not the beam in thy own eye? Hypocrite, cast first the beam out of thy own eye;~
and then shalt thou see clearly to take out the mote from thy brother's eye.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 5:3-4
v. Hearken to the voice of my prayer, O my King and my God. For to thee will I~
pray: O Lord.

[Secreta]
Be appeased O Lord, we beseech thee, and accept the victims we dedicate to thee,~
and grant that they may avail us for perpetual aid.
