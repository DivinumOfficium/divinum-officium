Lesson from the first book of Kings
!1 Kgs 1:28-31
28 And king David answered and said: Call to me Bethsabee. And when she was come in to the king, and stood before him,
29 The king swore and said: As the Lord liveth, who hath delivered my soul out of all distress,
30 Even as I swore to thee by the Lord the God of Israel, saying: Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead, so will I do this day.
31 And Bethsabee bowing with her face to the earth worshipped the king, saying: May my lord David live for ever

32 Kgs David also said: Call me Sadoc the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Banaias the son of Joiada. And when they were come in before the king,
33 He said to them: Take with you the servants of your lord, and set my son Solomon upon my mule: and bring him to Gihon.
34 And let Sadoc the priest, and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and you shall sound the trumpet, and shall say: God save king Solomon.
35 And you shall come up after him, and he shall come, and shall sit upon my throne, and he shall reign in my stead: and I will appoint him to be ruler over Israel, and over Juda.

40 And all the multitude went up after him, and the people played with pipes, and rejoiced with a great joy, and the earth rang with the noise of their cry.
