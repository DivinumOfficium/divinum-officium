v. Creator Spirit, all Divine,
Come, visit every soul of Thyne,
And fill with Thy celestial flame
The hearts which Thou Thyself didst frame.
_
O gift of God, Thine is the sweet
Consoling name of Paraclete
And spring of life and fire and love
And unction flowing from above.
_
The mystic sevenfold gifts are Thine,
Finger of God’s right hand divine;
The Father’s promise sent to teach
The tongue a rich and heavenly speech.
_
Kindle with fire brought from above
Each sense, and fill our hearts with love;
And grant our flesh, so weak and frail,
The strength of Thine which cannot fail.
_
Drive far away our deadly foe,
And grant us Thy true peace to know;
So we, led by Thy guidance still,
May safely pass through every ill.
_
To us, through Thee, the grace be shown
To know the Father and the Son;
And Spirit of Them both, may we
Forever rest our faith in Thee.
_
To Sire and Son be praises meet,
And to the Holy Paraclete;
And may Christ send us from above
That Holy Spirit’s gift of love.
Amen
