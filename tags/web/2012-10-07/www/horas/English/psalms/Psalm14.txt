14:1 (A psalm for David.) Lord, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? or who shall rest in thy holy hill?
14:2 He that walketh without blemish, and worketh justice:
14:3 He that speaketh truth in his heart, who hath not used deceit in his tongue: Nor hath done evil to his neighbour: nor taken up a reproach against his neighbours.
14:4 In his sight the malignant is brought to nothing: but he glorifieth them that fear the Lord. He that sweareth to his neighbour, and deceiveth not;
14:5 He that hath not put out his money to usury, nortaken bribes against the innocent: He that doth these things, shall not be moved for ever.
