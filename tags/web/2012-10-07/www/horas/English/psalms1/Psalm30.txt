30:1 In thee, O Lord, have I hoped, let me never be confounded: * deliver me in thy justice.
30:2 Bow down thy ear to me: * make haste to deliver me.
30:3 Be thou unto me a God, a protector, and a house of refuge, * to save me.
30:4 For thou art my strength and my refuge; * and for thy name’s sake thou wilt lead me, and nourish me.
30:5 Thou wilt bring me out of this snare, which they have hidden for me: * for thou art my protector.
30:6 Into thy hands I commend my spirit: * thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, the God of truth.
30:7 Thou hast hated them that regard vanities, * to no purpose.
30:8 But I have hoped in the Lord: * I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy.
30:9 For thou hast regarded my humility, * thou hast saved my soul out of distresses.
30:9 And thou hast not shut me up in the hands of the enemy: * thou hast set my feet in a spacious place.
30:10 Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am afflicted: * my eye is troubled with wrath, my soul, and my belly:
30:11 For my life is wasted with grief: * and my years in sighs.
30:12 My strength is weakened through poverty * and my bones are disturbed.
30:13 I am become a reproach among all my enemies, and very much to my neighbours; * and a fear to my acquaintance.
30:14 They that saw me without fled from me. * I am forgotten as one dead from the heart.
30:15 I am become as a vessel that is destroyed. * For I have heard the blame of many that dwell round about.
30:16 While they assembled together against me, * they consulted to take away my life.
30:17 But I have put my trust in thee, O Lord: * I said: Thou art my God. My lots are in thy hands.
30:18 Deliver me out of the hands of my enemies; * and from them that persecute me
30:19 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; save me in thy mercy. * Let me not be confounded, O Lord, for I have called upon thee.
30:19 Let the wicked be ashamed, and be brought down to hell. * Let deceitful lips be made dumb.
30:19 Which speak iniquity against the just, * with pride and abuse.
30:20 How great is the multitude of thy sweetness, O Lord, * which thou hast hidden for them that fear thee!
30:21 Which thou hast wrought for them that hope in thee, * in the sight of the sons of men.
30:22 Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy face, * from the disturbance of men.
30:23 Thou shalt protect them in thy tabernacle * from the contradiction of tongues.
30:24 Blessed be the Lord, * for he hath shewn his wonderful mercy to me in a fortified city.
30:25 But I said in the excess of my mind: * I am cast away from before thy eyes.
30:25 Therefore thou hast heard the voice of my prayer, * when I cried to thee.
30:25 O love the Lord, all ye his saints: * for the Lord will require truth, and will repay them abundantly that act proudly.
30:25 Do ye manfully, and let your heart be strengthened, * all ye that hope in the Lord.
