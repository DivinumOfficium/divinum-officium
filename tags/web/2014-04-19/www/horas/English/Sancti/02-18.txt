[Oratio]
Mercifully consider our weakness, O Almighty God, and whereas by the burden of our sins we are sore, let Simeon, your Martyr, be mercifully pleased to deliver us from all things which may hurt our bodies, and from all evil thoughts which may defile our souls.
$Per Dominum

[Lectio93]
Simeon, the son of Cleophas, (Matth. xiii. 55,) was chosen the second Bishop~
of Jerusalem, (in the year 62,) being the first after James. Under the Emperor~
Trajan he was accused before the Pro-Consul Atticus, as being both a Christian~
and a relation of Christ, this being the time when all were arrested that were~
of the lineage of David. He underwent with great suffering the same things that~
were inflicted on our Saviour, and all men marvelled to see with how great~
boldness and firmness he endured the grievous torment of the cross, at his great~
age, for he was an hundred and twenty years old. (a.d. 107 or 116.)
