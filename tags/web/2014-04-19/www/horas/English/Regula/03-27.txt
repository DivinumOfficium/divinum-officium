03-27# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 47: of Notifying the Hour of the Work of God
_
As to notifying the hour of the Work of God by day and by night, let the abbot be careful either to notify it himself or else let him entrust the responsibility to a reliable brother, that all things be done at the appointed hours. And the psalms and antiphons let those intone, in their order, after the abbot, whom he shall have appointed. But let not any presume to sing or read but such as can do that work reasonably, that those who hear may be edified. And let it be done with humility and gravity and awe by those to whom the abbot has assigned it.
