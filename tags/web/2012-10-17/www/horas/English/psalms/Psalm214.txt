(Canticum Jeremiae Jer 31:10-14)
10 Hear the word of the Lord, O ye nations, and declare it in the islands that are afar off, and say: He that scattered Israel will gather him: and he will keep him as the shepherd doth his flock.
11 For the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and delivered him out of the hand of one that was mightier than he. 
12 And they shall come, and shall give praise in mount Sion: and they shall flow together to the good things of the Lord, for the corn, and wine, and oil, and the increase of cattle and herds, and their soul shall be as a watered garden, and they shall be hungry no more. 
13 Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, the young men and old men together: and I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them joyful after their sorrow. 
14 And I will fill the soul of the priests with fatness: and my people shall be filled with my good things, saith the Lord.
