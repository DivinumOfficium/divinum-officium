16:1 Hear, O Lord, my justice: * attend to my supplication.
16:2 Give ear unto my prayer, * which proceedeth not from deceitful lips.
16:3 Let my judgment come forth from thy countenance: * let thy eyes behold the things that are equitable.
16:4 Thou hast proved my heart, and visited it by night, * thou hast tried me by fire: and iniquity hath not been found in me.
16:5 That my mouth may not speak the works of men: * for the sake of the words of thy lips, I have kept hard ways.
16:6 Perfect thou my goings in thy paths: * that my footsteps be not moved.
16:7 I have cried to thee, for thou, O God, hast heard me: * O incline thy ear unto me, and hear my words.
16:8 Shew forth thy wonderful mercies; * thou who savest them that trust in thee.
16:9 From them that resist thy right hand keep me, * as the apple of thy eye.
16:10 Protect me under the shadow of thy wings. * from the face of the wicked who have afflicted me.
16:11 My enemies have surrounded my soul: They have shut up their fat: * their mouth hath spoken proudly.
16:12 They have cast me forth, and now they have surrounded me: * they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth.
16:13 They have taken me, as a lion prepared for the prey; * and as a young lion dwelling in secret places.
16:14 Arise, O Lord, disappoint him and supplant him; * deliver my soul from the wicked one; thy sword from the enemies of thy hand.
16:15 O Lord, divide them from the few of the earth in their life: * their belly is filled from thy hidden stores.
16:16 They are full of children: * and they have left to their little ones the rest of their substance.
16:17 But as for me, I will appear before thy sight in justice: * I shall be satisfied when thy glory shall appear.
