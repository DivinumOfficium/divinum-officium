88:1 The mercies of the Lord * I will sing for ever.
88:2 I will shew forth thy truth with my mouth * to generation and generation.
88:3 For thou hast said: Mercy shall be built up for ever in the heavens: * thy truth shall be prepared in them.
88:4 I have made a covenant with my elect: I have sworn to David my servant: * Thy seed will I settle for ever.
88:5 And I will build up thy throne * unto generation and generation.
88:6 The heavens shall confess thy wonders, O Lord: * and thy truth in the church of the saints.
88:7 For who in the clouds can be compared to the Lord: * or who among the sons of God shall be like to God?
88:8 God, who is glorified in the assembly of the saints: * great and terrible above all them that are about him.
88:9 O Lord God of hosts, who is like to thee? * thou art mighty, O Lord, and thy truth is round about thee.
88:10 Thou rulest the power of the sea: * and appeasest the motion of the waves thereof.
88:11 Thou hast humbled the proud one, as one that is slain: * with the arm of thy strength thou hast scattered thy enemies.
88:12 Thine are the heavens, and thine is the earth: the world and the fulness thereof thou hast founded: * the north and the sea thou hast created.
88:13 Thabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name: * thy arm is with might.
88:14 Let thy hand be strengthened, and thy right hand exalted: * justice and judgment are the preparation of thy throne.
88:15 Mercy and truth shall go before thy face: * blessed is the people that knoweth jubilation.
88:16 They shall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance: and in thy name they shall rejoice all the day, * and in thy justice they shall be exalted.
88:17 For thou art the glory of their strength: * and in thy good pleasure shall our horn be exalted.
88:18 For our protection is of the Lord, * and of our king the holy one of Israel.
