[Oratio]
O God, Who forgives sins and desire to save mankind, we beseech Your mercy to~
grant, by the intercession of Blessed Mary, ever Virgin, and that of all Your~
Saints, that the souls of Your servants and handmaids who have departed this~
life may enter upon the enjoyment of unending happiness.

Lesson from the book of Revelations
!Apoc 14:13
In those days, I heard a voice from heaven saying, Write: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord henceforth. Yes, says the Spirit, let them rest from their labors, for their works follow them.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 6:51-55
At that time, Jesus said to the multitudes of the Jews, I am the living bread~
that has come down from heaven. If anyone eat of this bread he shall live~
forever; and the bread that I will give is My Flesh for the life of the world.~
The Jews on that account argued with one another, saying, How can this man give~
us His Flesh to eat? Jesus therefore said to them, Amen, amen, I say to you,~
unless you eat the Flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His Blood, you shall not~
have life in you. He who eats My Flesh and drinks My Blood has life everlasting~
and I will raise him up on the last day.

[Secreta]
O God, Whose mercy is boundless, graciously accept our humble prayers, and,~
through this sacrament of salvation, grant to the souls of all the faithful~
departed, to whom You gave the grace of believing in You, the remission of all~
their sins.
$Per Dominum

[Postcommunio]
Grant, we beseech You, O almighty and merciful God, that the souls of Your~
servants and handmaids for whom we have offered this sacrifice of praise to Your~
Majesty, cleansed of all sins by the virtue of this sacrament, may, by Your~
mercy, receive the joy of perpetual light.
