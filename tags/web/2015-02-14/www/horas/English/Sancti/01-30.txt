[Oratio]
O God, Who among the other miracles of thy power have bestowed the victory of~
martyrdom even upon the weaker sex, graciously grant that we who commemorate the~
anniversary of the death of blessed Martina, thy Virgin and Martyr, may come to~
thee by the path of her example.
$Per Dominum

[Hymnus Matutinum]
v. With joyous songs, great Rome, Martina's fame extol,
Her glowing praises tell, and all her mighty deeds;
A Virgin pure and chaste, she leads a stainless life,
And for her Lord a martyr bleeds.
_
A happy home is hers, and all that makes this world
So sweet, and fresh, and fair, to those who love its wiles:
From noblest parents sprung, ‘mid wealth, and love, and joy,
Her life speeds on, ‘mid naught but smiles.
_
These pleasures soon she spurns her wealth she gladly gives
To Christ's own blessed poor herself, to God above;
No other wealth she seeks save her own spotless Spouse,
Forever blest in His pure love.
_
T' agonizing hooks, the rending scourge,
Shook not the dauntless spirit in her breast;
With torments racked, angels her fainting flesh
Recruit with heavenly feast.
_
In vain they cast her to the ravening beasts;
Calm at her feet the lion crouches down:
Till smitten by the sword at length she goes
To her immortal crown.
_
Now with the Saints Martina reigns in bliss,
And where idolatry sat throned of yore,
From her victorious altar praise and prayer
With odorous incense soar.
_
O Thou, the martyrs' strength, all cheating joys expel,
And fill us with thy bright and never-fading love;
show us the beam divine, which forms the crowning joy,
God, Three in One, of bliss above.
Amen.

[Lectio4]
Martina was a maiden of a most illustrious Roman family, daughter of a Consul.~
She lost her parents while still very young, and, being inflamed with Christian~
zeal, she distributed her wealth, whereof she had abundance, with great~
profusion among the poor. Under the Emperor Alexander, she was commanded to~
sacrifice to the imaginary gods, and refused with much boldness to commit this~
great wickedness. Upon this she was again and again scourged, and mangled with~
iron prongs and hooks, and pieces of broken pottery. Her limbs were cut off~
piece by piece with sharp swords, and boiling tallow poured upon the living~
trunk. Lastly she was sent to be eaten publicly by the wild beasts in the~
amphitheatre, but by the will of God they would not touch her, and she was then~
thrown upon a burning pile, but still remained alive.

[Lectio5]
Come of her tormentors were so moved by the spectacle, that they repented, and,~
by the grace of God confessing the faith of Christ, through which she remained~
constant, were themselves tortured and beheaded. Martina herself lay praying,~
with a brightness on her face, while a matter like milk oozed from her body~
along with the blood, emitting a soft, sweet smell. She was as it were~
unconscious of an earthquake and most violent thunderstorm which arose and was~
raging, and while the lightning struck temples, and melted statues, she seemed~
in spirit rather to be seated above on a queenly throne, praising God in heaven~
among the Blessed.

[Lectio6]
The judge being infuriated at what had taken place, and chiefly at her unbending~
firmness, ordered the head of the martyr to be cut off. At the moment this was~
done, a peal which shook the city was heard, like a voice calling her home, and~
so great was the consternation, that it was made the means of conversion to many~
idolaters. The holy body of Martina wherein she had suffered in the Pontificate~
of Urban I. was discovered in the time of Urban VIII., in the very old Church~
called after her, situated at the foot of the Capitoline Hill, near the~
Mamertine Prison, along with the bodies of the holy martyrs Concordius,~
Epiphanius, and others. The Church was then altered and restored and handsomely~
decorated, and then the body was replaced in it, amid public rejoicings, with a~
solemn ceremony and procession.

[Hymnus Laudes]
v. Be thou the guardian of thy native land,
And to all Christian nations grant repose
From din of arms, and every hostile band—
From all our borders drive away our foes.
_
Bid Christian princes marshal all their force
Beneath the sacred standard of the Rood,
To avenge sweet Salem's sacrilegious loss,
And crush the Paynim red with guiltless blood.
_
On thee our hopes are built, as on a tower;
Receive the homage we now humbly pay,
The vows which Rome accomplishes this hour,
With pious rites, and canticles' sweet lay.
_
Keep far from us all dangerous delight,
O God, who comfortest thy Martyrs' pain;
One God in Persons Three, bestow thy light
Wherewith Thou makest strong thy Martyrs slain.
Amen.

[Hymnus Vespera 3]
v. Be thou the guardian of thy native land,
And to all Christian nations grant repose
From din of arms, and every hostile band—
From all our borders drive away our foes.
_
Bid Christian princes marshal all their force
Beneath the sacred standard of the Rood,
To avenge sweet Salem's sacrilegious loss,
And crush the Paynim red with guiltless blood.
_
On thee our hopes are built, as on a tower;
Receive the homage we now humbly pay,
The vows which Rome accomplishes this hour,
With pious rites, and canticles' sweet lay.
_
Keep far from us all dangerous delight,
O God, who comfortest thy Martyrs' pain;
One God in Persons Three, bestow thy light
Wherewith Thou makest strong thy Martyrs slain.
Amen.

[Lectio94]
Martina, a Roman virgin of an illustrious family, lost her parents while she was~
still young and distributed her vast fortune lavishly to the poor. Under the~
emperor Alexander, she was commanded to sacrifice to the imaginary gods, and~
refused to commit this great crime. First she was subjected to many kinds of~
tortures and, finally condemned to the beasts in the amphitheater, was left~
unharmed by divine protection. Then she was thrown into a burning furnace, and~
again was preserved safe. Some of her tormentors moved by this unheard-of~
miracle embraced the faith of Christ and received the crown of martyrdom. At~
Martina's prayers, God worked many marvels. Angered by these and confounded by~
the Virgin's constancy, the judge ordered her beheaded. All this took place when~
St. Urban I was pope. Under Urban VIII, her body was found in the old church~
named after her at the Mamertine Prison together with the bodies of the holy~
Martyrs Concordius, Epiphanius and their companions. When the place had been~
renovated and decorated, her body was solemnly reburied, amid the rejoicing of~
the whole City.
