Evangélium szent János könyvéből
!John 7:14-31
Azon időben amikor már eltelt az ünnep fele, Jézus fölment a templomba, és tanított. A zsidók csodálkoztak És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!29th Tract on John.
He Who had gone up unto the Feast, not openly, but as it were in secret, the~
Same taught, and spake openly, and no man laid hands upon Him. That He had hid~
Himself, was for example's sake; that He manifested Himself, was to show His~
power. And when He taught, the Jews marvelled. As seemeth to my I mind, they all~
marvelled, but were not all converted. And wherefore marvelled they? Because~
many of them knew where He was born, and how He had been brought up. They had~
never seen Him learn letters; but they heard Him dispute concerning the law, and~
alledge the testimony of the same, as no man could do who had not read it; and~
no man can read unless he learn; and therefore they marvelled. But their~
marvelling was unto the Teacher an occasion for the revealing of higher truth.

[Responsory1]
R. Why go ye about to kill Me, a Man That hath l told you the truth?
* If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why smitest thou~
Me?
V. Many good works have I wrought among you; for which of those works go ye~
about to kill Me?
R. If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why smitest~
thou Me?

[Lectio2]
For when they marvelled and whispered, the Lord said a certain deep thing, yea, a~
thing worthy of very careful thought and discussion. And what was this thing~
which the Lord gave for an answer to such as marvelled that He knew letters,~
having never learned?  Jesus answered them and said My doctrine is not Mine,~
but His That sent Me. Here is the first depth, for He seemeth in these few words~
to enunciate a contradiction. He saith not This doctrine is not Mine but~
My doctrine is not Mine. If it be not thine, O thine? If it be thine, wherefore~
sayest Thou that it is not thine? For Thou sayest My doctrine is not Mine.

[Responsory2]
R. I, even I, the Lord, have led you forty years in the wilderness, and your~
clothes are not waxen old upon you.
* I rained down manna upon you from heaven, and ye have forgotten Me, saith the~
Lord.
V. I led you forth out of the land of Egypt, and delivered you from the house of~
bondage.
R. I rained down manna upon you from heaven, and ye have forgotten Me, saith the~
Lord.

[Lectio3]
Let us then carefully regard what this same holy Evangelist saith in the~
beginning of his Gospel, and we shall find there wherewith to loose the knot of~
this difficulty. There it is written In the beginning was the Word, and the~
Word was with God, and the Word was God. (i. 1.) What is the doctrine of the~
Father but the Word of the Father? If Christ therefore be the Word of the Father,~
He is the doctrine of the Father. But a Word cannot be of no one, but must needs,~
if it be a Word, have some one whose word it is. Christ therefore saith that His~
doctrine is Himself, and therefore not His, forasmuch as He is the Word of the~
Father. And what hast thou that is so much thine own as thy self? Or what is~
there that is so little thine own as thyself, if that which thou art is~
another's?
