Lesson from the Acts of Apostles
!Acts 10:1-8
1 And there was a certain man in Caesarea, named Cornelius, a centurion of that which is called the Italian band; 
2 A religious man, and fearing God with all his house, giving much alms to the people, and always praying to God. 
3 This man saw in a vision manifestly, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in unto him, and saying to him: Cornelius. 
4 And he, beholding him, being seized with fear, said: What is it, Lord? And he said to him: thy prayers and thy alms are ascended for a memorial in the sight of God. 
5 And now send men to Joppe, and call hither one Simon, who is surnamed Peter:
6 He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side. He will tell thee what thou must do. 
7 And when the angel who spoke to him was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a soldier who feared the Lord, of them that were under him. 
8 To whom when he had related all, he sent them to Joppe.

!Acts 10:9-17
9 And on the next day, whilst they were going on their journey, and drawing nigh to the city, Peter went up to the higher parts of the house to pray, about the sixth hour. 
10 And being hungry, he was desirous to taste somewhat. And as they were preparing, there came upon him an ecstasy of mind.
11 And he saw the heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending, as it were a great linen sheet let down by the four corners from heaven to the earth: 
12 Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts, and creeping things of the earth, and fowls of the air. 
13 And there came a voice to him: Arise, Peter; kill and eat. 
14 But Peter said: Far be it from me; for I never did eat any thing that is common and unclean. 
15 And the voice spoke to him again the second time: That which God hath cleansed, do not thou call common.
16 And this was done thrice; and presently the vessel was taken up into heaven. 
17 Now, whilst Peter was doubting within himself, what the vision that he had seen should mean, behold the men who were sent from Cornelius, inquiring for Simon's house, stood at the gate.

!Acts 10:34-41
34 And Peter opening his mouth, said: In very deed I perceive, that God is not a respecter of persons. 
35 But in every nation, he that feareth him, and worketh justice, is acceptable to him.
36 God sent the word to the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all.) 
37 You know the word which hath been published through all Judea: for it began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached, 
38 Jesus of Nazareth: how God anointed him with the Holy Ghost, and with power, who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. 
39 And we are witnesses of all things that he did in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem, whom they killed, hanging him upon a tree. 
40 Him God raised up the third day, and gave him to be made manifest,
41 Not to all the people, but to witnesses preordained by God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he arose again from the dead;
