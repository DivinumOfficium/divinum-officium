Olvasmány szent János apostol elsõ levelébõl
!1 John 5:4-10
v. Mert mindenki, aki az Istentõl született, legyõzi a világot. És ez a gyõzelem - gyõzelem a világ fölött! - a mi hitünk.  Ki gyõzi le a világot, ha nem az, aki hiszi, hogy Jézus az Isten Fia?  Õ az, aki víz és vér által jött, Jézus Krisztus. Nem csupán víz által, hanem víz és vér által. És a Lélek tesz tanúságot róla, mert a Lélek az igazság.  Tehát hárman tanúskodnak:  a Lélek, a víz és a vér, és ez a három egy.  Ha az emberek tanúságát is elfogadjuk, az Isten tanúsága többet jelent. Az Isten tanúsága az, hogy tanúságot tett a Fia mellett.  Aki hisz az Isten Fiában, magában hordja az Isten tanúságát. Aki nem hisz Istennek, hazugságot tulajdonít neki, épp mert nem hisz tanúságában, amelyet az Isten Fia mellett tett.

[Evangelium]
Evangélium + szent János Apostol kõnyvébõl
!John 20. 19-31
At that time, when it was late that same day, the first of the week, and the~
doors were shut, where the disciples were gathered together for fear of the Jews,~
Jesus came, and stood in the midst and said to them: Peace be to you. And when~
He had said this, He showed them His hands and His side. The disciples therefore~
were glad, when they saw the Lord. He said therefore to them again: Peace be to~
you. As the Father hath sent Me, I also send you. When He had said this, He~
breathed on them, and He said to them: Receive ye the Holy Ghost: whose sins you~
shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are~
retained. Now Thomas, one of the Twelve, who is called Didymus, was not with~
them when Jesus came. The other disciples therefore said to him: We have seen~
the Lord. But he said to them: Except I shall see in His hands the print of the~
nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into His~
side, I will not believe. And after eight days, again His disciples were within,~
and Thomas with them. Jesus cometh, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst,~
and said: Peace be to you. The He saith to Thomas: Put in thy finger hither, and~
see My hands, and bring hither thy hand, and put into My side; and be not~
faithless, but believing. Thomas answered and said to Him: my Lord and my God.~
Jesus saith to him: Because thou hast seen Me, Thomas, thou hast believed;~
blessed are they that have not seen, and have believed. Many other signs also~
did Jesus in the sight of His disciples, which are not written in this book. But~
these are written, that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God;~
and that, believing, you may have life in His Name.
