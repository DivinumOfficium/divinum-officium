!Commemoratio for the Holy Martyrs.
Felix was arrested in the reign of the Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, on the~
charge of having embraced the Christian Faith, and was brought to the temple of~
Serapis. When he was ordered to offer sacrifice, he spat in the face of the~
brazen idol, which thereupon fell down. When this happened a second and third~
time in the temples of Mercury and Diana, he was accused of impiety and magic,~
and tortured upon the rack. It was not long, however, before he was led out to~
the second mile-stone upon the road to Ostia, to be smitten with the axe. As~
they were on the way thither, they chanced to meet a certain Christian, who,~
when he knew that Felix was going to finish his testimony, said aloud, I live by~
the same law as he doth I worship the same Christ Jesus. And therewith he~
kissed Felix, and they were beheaded together, upon the 30th day of August. What~
the name of the second person was the Christians never knew, and he is therefore~
honoured under the title of Himwho-was-added x that is, added to the company~
of the Holy Martyr Felix in winning of the crown.
