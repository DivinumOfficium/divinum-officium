Evangélium szent Lukács Evangélista kõnyvébõl
!Luke 1:26-38
Azon idõben Isten elküldte Gábor angyalt Galilea Názáret nevû városába egy szûzhöz, aki egy Dávid házából való férfinak, Józsefnek volt a jegyese, és Máriának hívták. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan,)
!Bk. ii. on Luke.
The mysteries of God are unsearchable, and it is especially declared by a~
Prophet, that a man can hardly know His counsels. (Wisd. ix. 13.) Nevertheless,~
some things have been revealed to us, and we may gather from some of the words~
and works of the Lord our Saviour, that there was a special purpose of God, in~
the fact that she who was chosen to be the mother of the Lord was espoused to a~
man. Why did not the power of the Highest overshadow her before she was so~
espoused? Perhaps it was lest any might blasphemously say that she had conceived~
in adultery the Holy One.

[Responsory1]
R. O thou that bringest good tidings of peace to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice~
with strength!
* Say unto the cities of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem Behold,~
our God will come, for Whom we waited.
V. O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion get thee up into the high mountain,~
lift up thy voice with strength.
R. Say unto the cities of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem Behold,~
our God will come, for Whom we waited.

[Lectio2]
And the Angel came in unto her. Let us learn from this Virgin how to bear~
ourselves, let us learn her modesty, let us learn by her devout utterance, above~
all let us learn by the holy mystery enacted. It is the part of a maiden to be'~
timid, to avoid the advances of men, and to shrink from men's addresses. Would~
that our women would learn from the example of modesty here set before us. She~
upon whom the stare of men had never been fixed was alone in her chamber, and~
she found herself alone with Angels. There was neither companion nor witness~
there, that what passed might not be debased in gossip and the Angel saluted~
her.

[Responsory2]
R. There shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Man shall rise out of Israel, and~
shall smite through all the princes of the aliens.
* And all the earth shall be His possession.
V. All kings shall fall down before Him, all nations shall serve Him.
R. And all the earth shall be His possession.

[Lectio3]
The message of God to the Virgin was a mystery, which it was not lawful for the~
mouth of men, but only of Angels, to utter. For the first time on earth the~
words are spoken The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee. The holy maiden heareth,~
and believeth. At length she said Behold the handmaid of the Lord be it~
unto me according to thy word. Here is an example of lowliness, here is a~
pattern of true devotion. At the very moment that she is told she is chosen to~
be the mother of the Lord she at once declareth herself His handmaid. The~
knowledge that she was mother of God caused in the heart of Mary only an act of~
humility.

[Responsory3]
R. The Lord, the Ruler, cometh quickly.
* And His name shall be called Emmanuel.
V. In His days shall righteousness flourish, and abundance of peace.
R. And His name shall be called Emmanuel.
&Gloria
R. And His name shall be called Emmanuel.

[Ant 2]
The angel Gabriel * was sent to Mary, a virgin espoused to Joseph.

[Oratio]
Grant, we beseech thee, Almighty God, that the solemn Feast of our redemption,~
which is now at hand, may both help us in the life which now is, and further us~
toward the attaining of thine eternal joy in that which is to come. 
$Per Dominum.

[Ant 3]
Behold the handmaid * of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word.
