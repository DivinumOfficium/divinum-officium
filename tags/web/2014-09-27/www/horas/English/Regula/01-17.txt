01-17# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 3: Concerning the Calling of the Brethren to Council. Continued.
_
In all things therefore let all follow the rule’s dictates and let it not be departed from by anyone. Let no one in the monastery follow the desires of his own heart, neither let anyone presume insolently to contend with his abbot either within or without the monastery. But if anyone shall have so presumed, let him be subject to the rule’s discipline. Let the abbot himself however do all in the fear of God and according to the rule; knowing that he will, beyond all doubt, have to render account of all his own judgments to God the most just Judge. And if any less important business has to be transacted on behalf of the monastery, let counsel be taken, but with the seniors only, as it is written: “Do everything with counsel and having so done thou wilt not repent.”
