51:1 (Unto the end, understanding for David)
51:2 (When Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul: David went to the house of Achimelech.)
51:3 Why dost thou glory in malice, thou that art mighty in iniquity?
51:4 All the day long thy tongue hath devised injustice: as a sharp razor, thou hast wrought deceit.
51:5 Thou hast loved malice more than goodness: and iniquity rather than to speak righteousness.
51:6 Thou hast loved all the words of ruin, O deceitful tongue.
51:7 Therefore will God destroy thee for ever: he will pluck thee out, and remove thee from thy dwelling place: and thy root out of the land of the living.
51:8 The just shall see and fear, and shall laugh at him, and say:
51:9 Behold the man that made not God his helper: But trusted in the abundance of his riches: and prevailed in his vanity.
51:10 But I, as a fruitful olive tree in the house of God, have hoped in the mercy of God for ever, yea for ever and ever.
51:11 I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I will wait on thy name, for it is good in the sight of thy saints.
