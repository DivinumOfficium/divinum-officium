[Lectio1]
From the letter of blessed Apostle Paul to the Romans
!Rom 14:1-4
1 NOW him that is weak in faith, take unto you: not in disputes about thoughts.
2 For one believeth that he may eat all things: but he that is weak, let him eat~
herbs.
3 Let not him that eateth, despise him that eateth not: and he that eateth not,~
let him not judge him that eateth. For God hath taken him to him.
4 Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? To his own lord he standeth~
or falleth. And he shall stand: for God is able to make him stand.

!Rom 14:5-8
5 For one judgeth between day and day: and another judgeth every day: let every~
man abound in his own sense.
6 He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord. And he that eateth,~
eateth to the Lord: for he giveth thanks to God. And he that eateth not, to the~
Lord he eateth not, and giveth thanks to God.
7 For none of us liveth to himself; and no man dieth to himself.
8 For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; or whether we die, we die unto the~
Lord. Therefore, whether we live, or whether we die, we are the Lord's.

!Rom 14:9-13
9 For to this end Christ died and rose again; that he might be Lord both of the~
dead and of the living.
10 But thou, why judgest thou thy brother? or thou, why dost thou despise thy~
brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
11 For it is written: As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and~
every tongue shall confess to God.
12 Therefore every one of us shall render account to God for himself.
13 Let us not therefore judge one another any more. But judge this rather, that~
you put not a stumblingblock or a scandal in your brother's way.
