Lesson from the book of Revelations
!Apoc 14:1 - 5.
In those days, I saw the Lamb standing upon Mount Sion, and with Him a hundred and forty-four thousand having His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads. And I heard a voice from heaven like a voice of many waters, and like a voice of loud thunder; and the voice that I heard was as of harpers playing on their harps. And they were singing as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders; and no one could learn the song except those hundred and forty-four thousand, who have been purchased from the earth. These are they who were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These were purchased from among men, first-fruits unto God and unto the Lamb, and in their mouth there was found no lie; they are without blemish before the throne of God.

[Graduale]
!Ps 123:7 - 8.
We were rescued like a bird from the fowlers’ snare.
V. Broken was the snare, and we were freed. Our help is in the name of the Lord,~
Who made heaven and earth. Alleluia, alleluia.
!Ps 112:1 
V. Praise the Lord, you children, praise the name of the Lord.~
Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 2:13 - 18.
At that time, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph, saying, Arise,~
and take the Child and His mother, and flee into Egypt, and remain there until I~
tell you. For Herod will seek the Child to destroy Him. So he arose, and took~
the Child and His mother by night, and withdrew into Egypt, and remained there~
until the death of Herod; that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet~
might be fulfilled, Out of Egypt I called My Son. Then Herod, seeing that he had~
been tricked by the Magi, was exceedingly angry; and he sent and slew all the~
boys in Bethlehem and all its neighborhood who were two years old or under,~
according to the time that he had carefully ascertained from the Magi. Then was~
fulfilled what was spoken through Jeremias the prophet. A voice was heard in~
Rama, weeping and loud lamentation; Rachel weeping for her children, and she~
would not be comforted, because they are no more.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 123:7
We were rescued like a bird from the fowlers’ snare. Broken was the snare and~
