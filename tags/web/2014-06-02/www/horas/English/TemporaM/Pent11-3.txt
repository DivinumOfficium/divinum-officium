Lesson from the second book of Kings
!2 Kgs 23:24-26
24 Moreover the diviners by spirits, and soothsayers, and the figures of idols,~
and the uncleannesses, and the abominations, that had been in the land of Juda,~
and Jerusalem, Josias took away: that he might perform the words of the law,~
that were written in the book which Helcias the priest had found in the temple~
of the Lord.
25 There was no king before him like unto him, that returned to the Lord with~
all his heart, and with all his soul, and with ail his strength, according to~
all the law of Moses: neither after him did there arise any like him.
26 But yet the Lord turned not away from the wrath of his great indignation,~
wherewith his anger was kindled against Juda: because of the provocations,~
wherewith Manasses had provoked him

27 And the Lord said: I will remove Juda also from before my face, as I have~
removed Israel: and I will cast off this city Jerusalem, which I chose, and the~
house, of which I said: My name shall be there. 28 Now the rest of the acts of~
Josias, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the words of~
the days of the kings of Juda?
29 In his days Pharao Nechao king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria~
to the river Euphrates: and king Josias went to meet him: and was slain at~
Mageddo, when he had seen him.
30 And his servants carried him dead from Mageddo: and they brought him to~
Jerusalem, and buried him in Iris own sepulchre.

30 And the people of the land took Joachaz the son of Josias: and they anointed~
him, and made him king in his father's stead.
31 Joachaz was three and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned~
three months in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Amital, the daughter of~
Jeremias of Lobna.
32 And he did evil before the Lord, according to all that his fathers had done.
33 And Pharao Nechao bound him at Rebla, which is in the land of Emath, that he~
should not reign in Jerusalem: and he set a fine upon the land, of a hundred~
talents of silver, and a talent of gold.
34 And Pharao Nechao made Eliacim the son of Josias king in the room of Josias~
his father: and turned his name to Joakim. And he took Joachaz away and carried~
him into Egypt, and he died there.
