24:1 To thee, O Lord, have I lifted up my soul: * In thee, O my God, I put my trust; let me not be ashamed.
24:2 Neither let my enemies laugh at me: * for none of them that wait on thee shall be confounded.
24:3 Let all them be confounded that act unjust things * without cause.
24:4 Shew, O Lord, thy ways to me, * and teach me thy paths.
24:5 Direct me in thy truth, and teach me; * for thou art God my Saviour; and on thee have I waited all the day long.
24:6 Remember, O Lord, thy bowels of compassion; * and thy mercies that are from the beginning of the world.
24:7 The sins of my youth * and my ignorances do not remember.
24:7 According to thy mercy remember thou me: * for thy goodness’ sake, O Lord.
24:8 The Lord is sweet and righteous: * therefore he will give a law to sinners in the way.
24:9 He will guide the mild in judgment: * he will teach the meek his ways.
24:10 All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth, * to them that seek after his covenant and his testimonies.
24:11 For thy name’s sake, O Lord, thou wilt pardon my sin: * for it is great.
24:12 Who is the man that feareth the Lord? * He hath appointed him a law in the way he hath chosen.
24:13 His soul shall dwell in good things: * and his seed shall inherit the land.
24:14 The Lord is a firmament to them that fear him: * and his covenant shall be made manifest to them.
24:15 My eyes are ever towards the Lord: * for he shall pluck my feet out of the snare.
24:16 Look thou upon me, and have mercy on me; * for I am alone and poor.
24:17 The troubles of my heart are multiplied: * deliver me from my necessities.
24:18 See my abjection and my labour; * and forgive me all my sins.
24:19 Consider my enemies for they are multiplied, * and have hated me with an unjust hatred.
24:20 Keep thou my soul, and deliver me: * I shall not be ashamed, for I have hoped in thee.
24:21 The innocent and the upright have adhered to me: * because I have waited on thee.
24:22 Deliver Israel, O God, * from all his tribulations.
