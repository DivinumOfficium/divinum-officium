Lesson from the first letter of St John the Apostle
!1 John 3:13-18
Beloved: Do not be surprised if the world hates you. We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love abides in death. Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer. And you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. In this we have come to know His love that He laid down His life for us; and we likewise ought to lay down our life for the brethren. He who has the goods of this world and sees his brother in need and closes his heart to him, how does the love of God abide in him? My dear children, let us not love in word, neither with the tongue, but in deed and in truth.

[Graduale]
!Ps 36:30-31
The mouth of the just man tells of wisdom, and his tongue utters what is right.
V. The law of his God is in his heart, and his steps do not falter. Alleluia,~
alleluia.
!Ps 111:1
V. Happy the man who fears the Lord, who greatly delights in His commands.~
Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 15:12-16
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples, This is My commandment, that you love~
one another as I have loved you. Greater love than this no one has, that one lay~
down his life for his friends. You are My friends if you do the things I command~
you. No longer do I call you servants, because the servant does not know what~
his master does. But I have called you friends, because all things that I have~
heard from My Father I have made known to you. You have not chosen Me, but I~
have chosen you, and have appointed you that you should go and bear fruit, and~
that your fruit should remain; that whatever you ask the Father in My name He~
may give you.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 20:2-3
O Lord, in Your strength the just man is glad; in Your victory how greatly he~
rejoices! You have granted him his heart’s desire.

[Secreta]
Through the prayers of St. Camillus may this spotless sacrificial offering, by~
which we renew the work of our Lord Jesus Christ’s infinite charity, be a~
healing remedy against all infirmities of body and soul and a consolation and~
protection in our last agony.

!Matt 25:36, 40.
I was sick and you visited Me: Amen, amen, I say to you, as long as you did it~
for one of these the least of My brethren, you did it for Me.

[Postcommunio]
Through this heavenly food which we have received with holy devotion as we~
celebrate the feast of St. Camillus, Your Confessor, grant, we beseech You, O~
Lord, that in the hour of our death, strengthened by Your sacraments and~
absolved of all our sins, we may be found worthy to be taken us, rejoicing, into~
the bosom of Your mercy.
