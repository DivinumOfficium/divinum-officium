Evangélium szent Máté könyvébõl
!Matt 5:43-48; 6:1-4
Azon idõben mondá Jézus tanítványainak: Hallottátok a parancsot: Szeresd felebarátodat, és gyûlöld ellenségedet. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Bk. i. Comm. on Matth. v. and vi. )
 But I say unto you Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you. There~
are many who judge of the commandments of the Lord by their own weakness, and~
not by the strength of His Saints; and so deem Him to have commanded things~
impossible. These are they who think that not to hate their enemies is all that~
they are able to do; and that to command us to love them, is to command more~
than man's nature can bear. It behoveth them to know, that this which Christ~
commandeth is not impossible, albeit perfect. This is what David did in respect~
of Saul and Absalom; the martyr Stephen also prayed for his enemies, even while~
they were stoning him; and Paul could wish that himself were accursed from~
Christ for his persecutors. (Rom. ix. 3.) And this, Jesus Himself did, as well~
as taught, when He said Father, forgive them for they know not what they~
do. (Luke xxiii. 34.)

[Lectio2]
That ye may be the children of your Father Which is in heaven. If he that doeth~
the commandments of God becometh a son of God, then is he not a son by nature,~
but by his own choice. Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a~
trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues, and in the streets,~
that they may have glory of men. He that soundeth a trumpet before him, when he~
doeth alms, is an hypocrite. He that disfigureth his face, when he fasteth, to~
the end that he may show the emptiness of his belly in his looks, he also is an~
hypocrite.

[Lectio3]
He that prayeth in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that he may~
be seen of men, is an hypocrite. From all which, we gather that an hypocrite is~
one which doeth anything that he may have glory of men. To me also it seemeth~
that he which saith unto his brother Let me pull out the mote out of thine~
eye, (vii. 4,) that he also is an hypocrite; for he proposeth to take upon him~
that office for vainglory's sake, that he himself may appear righteous.~
Therefore the Lord saith unto him Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam~
out of thine own eye. Thus we see that it is, not the doing good, but the motive~
which moveth us to do good, which will meet with reward from God; and, if thou~
stray but a little from the right way, it is of small moment whether thou wander~
to the right hand or to the left, when once thou hast lost the straight path.
