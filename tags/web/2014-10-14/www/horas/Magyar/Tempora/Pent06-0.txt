Olvasmány Sámuel második könyvébõl
!2 Sam 12:1-4
1 Akkor az Úr elküldte Nátán prófétát Dávidhoz. El is ment hozzá, és így~
beszélt: "Egy városban élt két ember. Az egyik gazdag volt, a másik szegény.
2 A gazdagnak rengeteg juha-kecskéje és barma volt.
3 A szegénynek azonban nem volt egyebe, csak egy kis báránya, vette magának.~
Etette, úgyhogy megnõtt, vele magával és gyermekeivel. Evett a kenyerébõl és~
ivott a poharából. Az ölében aludt, s olyan volt, mintha a lánya lett volna.
4 Egyszer vendég érkezett a gazdag emberhez. De nem tudta rászánni magát, hogy a~
juhai vagy barmai közül egyet is elvegyen, és a vendégnek, aki érkezett,~
elkészítse. Ezért elvette a szegény ember báránykáját, és azt készítette el~
vendégének."

[Responsory1]
R. Prepare your hearts unto the Lord, and serve Him Only
* And He will deliver you out of the hand of your enemies.
V. Return unto Him with all your hearts, and put away the strange gods from~
among you.
R. And He will deliver you out of the hand of your enemies.

[Lectio2]
!2 Sam 12:5-9
5 Dávid nagyon megharagudott az emberre, és azt mondta Nátánnak: "Amint igaz,~
hogy az Úr él: az az ember, aki ilyet tesz, az a halál fia.
6 A bárányt négyszeresen vissza kell fizetnie, amiért így tett, és nem volt~
kímélettel."
7 Erre Nátán így szólt Dávidhoz: "Magad vagy ez az ember! Ezt mondta hát az Úr,~
Izrael Istene: Fölkentelek Izrael királyává és kiszabadítottalak Saul kezébõl.
8 Neked adtam urad házát és a kebledre urad asszonyait, rád bíztam Izrael házát~
és Júda házát. S ha ez kevés lett volna, még megtetéztem volna ezzel meg azzal.
9 Miért vetetted hát meg az Urat, s tettél olyat, ami gonosznak számít az Úr~
szemében? Kard által elveszítetted a hetita Uriját, hogy feleségül vedd a~
feleségét. Igen, elveszítetted az ammoniták kardja által!

[Responsory2]
R. God, Which heareth all, even He sent His Angel, and took me from keeping my~
father's sheep, and
* Anointed me with the oil of His mercy.
V. The Lord That delivered me out of the mouth of the lion, and out of the paw~
of the bear
R. And anointed me with the oil of His mercy.

[Lectio3]
!2 Sam 12:10-16
10 Nos, a kard sose fordul el házadtól, amiért megvetettél, és elvetted a hetita~
Urijától a feleségét, hogy a te asszonyod legyen.
11 Ezt mondta az Úr: Nos, a saját házadból hozok rád romlást. Elveszem a szemed~
láttára asszonyaidat és odaadom õket más valakinek, hogy napvilágnál~
asszonyaiddal háljon.
12 Te titokban tetted, de én egész Izrael szeme láttára, napvilágnál viszem ezt~
végbe!"
13 Erre Dávid így szólt Nátánhoz: "Vétkeztem az Úr ellen!" Nátán ezt válaszolta~
Dávidnak: "Így az Úr is megbocsátja bûnödet, s nem halsz meg.
14 De mert ezzel a tetteddel káromoltad az Urat, a fiú, aki született neked,~
meghal."
15 Ezzel Nátán elment haza. Az Úr megverte a gyermeket, akit Urija felesége~
szült Dávidnak, úgyhogy súlyosan megbetegedett.
16 Dávid az Úrhoz fordult a fiú miatt; szigorú böjtöt tartott, s amikor hazament,~
éjszaka a puszta földön aludt, zsákkal takarózva.

[Responsory3]
R. The Lord That delivered me out of the mouth of the lion, and out of the paw~
of the bear
* He will deliver me out of the hand of mine enemies.
V. God hath sent forth His mercy and His truth, and delivered my soul from among~
the lion's whelps.
R. He will deliver me out of the hand of mine enemies.
&Gloria
R. He will deliver me out of the hand of mine enemies.

From the Book "On the Defence of David" written by St Ambrose, Bishop of Milan.
!i. 2.
The child died. The next few verses in the Bible describe, very touchingly, the~
conduct of David on the occasion and, afterwards, how Solomon was born of~
Bathsheba. David composed the Miserere during his repentance. In how many things~
doth each one of us transgress every hour And nevertheless not one of all us~
common men thinketh it well to confess his sin. Yet that strong and great King~
would not suffer the acknowledgment of his iniquity to remain, even for a moment,~
hidden in his own heart. With eager confession and bitter sorrow, he admitted~
that he had sinned against the Lord. Which of you will easily find me now some~
honoured and wealthy person, who will not take it ill if I rebuke him for a~
fault whereof he is guilty But David, amid the splendours of a throne and' the~
certainty of Divine revelations, when he was rebuked by one of his subjects for~
his grievous transgression, was not roused to anger, but contrariwise,~
acknowledged his sin with groans and affliction.

[Responsory4]
R. Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.
* Because the hand of the Lord was with him, he smote the Philistine, and took~
away the reproach from Israel.
V. Is not this David? Did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying~
Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
R. Because the hand of the Lord was with him, he smote the Philistine, and took~
away the reproach from Israel.

[Lectio5]
The heart-felt sorrow of David moved the Lord to compassion, so that Nathan said~
Because thou hast repented, the Lord also hath put away thy sin. The instant~
gift of pardon declareth the depth of the King's repentance, which was able to~
obtain the forgiveness of so grievous a transgression. Other men, when they be~
rebuked of Priests, do but aggravate the heinousness of their sins by the~
seeking to deny or to excuse them, and thereby make deeper their fall by means~
of that which should have helped them up. But the saints of the Lord who will to~
fight a good fight of godliness unto the end and to finish their course by~
saving their souls, howbeit, they may perchance have fallen like other men, have~
done so rather through man's weakness than through lust for iniquity, and rise~
more eager to go on than before. Shame goadeth them on to fly at higher things.~
So that not only is their fall to be reckoned to have nowise hampered them, but~
rather to have quickened their speed.

[Responsory5]
R. Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain upon~
you
* For there are the mighty of Israel fallen
V. All ye mountains that stand round about, the Lord look upon you but let Him~
pass by Gilboa
R. For there are the mighty of Israel fallen

[Lectio6]
David sinned; and so oftentimes do other kings. David repented with groaning and~
tears and so do not oftentimes other kings. He admitted his guilt he~
implored forgiveness he cast himself down upon the ground, and there wept over~
his crime he fasted he prayed by publishing his sorrow he left an~
everlasting witness of his acknowledgment. What meaner men blush to do, the~
King was not ashamed to own. They who are answerable to law are bold to deny~
their crimes, and too haughty to ask pardon. Not so he, though he could be haled~
before no earthly judgment-seat. That he sinned was a matter flowing from his~
nature that he asked for pardon, his own repentance. To fall is common to all~
men, but his confession was his own. To transgress thus was nature to efface~
his guilt, greatness.

[Responsory6]
R. Thus saith the Lord I took thee out of thy father's house, and appointed~
thee to be ruler over My people, over Israel.
* And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, to establish thy kingdom for~
ever.
V. And I have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that~
are in the earth and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies.
R. And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, to establish thy kingdom for~
ever.
&Gloria
R. And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, to establish thy kingdom for~
ever.

Evangélium szent Márk Evangélista kõnyvébõl
!Mark 8:1-9
Azokban a napokban ismét nagy népsokaság vette körül. Nem volt mit enniük, ezért~
magához szólította tanítványait. Sajnálom a tömeget - mondta -, mivel már~
harmadnapja kitartanak mellettem, és nincs mit enniük. És így tovább
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop of Milan.
!Bk. vi. on Luke ix.
After that that woman, who is a type of the Church, was healed of the issue of~
blood (Luke viii. 43-48) after that the Lord had sent His disciples to preach~
the kingdom of God (ix. 2), His heavenly tenderness gave food. But consider who~
they were unto whom He gave it. He gave it not to such as dwell at ease, not~
to men in cities, not to such as sit in places of worldly splendour, but to~
men seeking Christ in a desert place. Such as are not given to niceness are they~
whom Christ receiveth, and unto whom the Word of God speaketh, not of earthly~
things, but of the kingdom of God (11.) And if any bear in them the running~
sores of fleshly passion, He healeth them.

[Responsory7]
@Tempora/Pent01-3:Responsory1

[Lectio8]
And then it came to pass that, as He had healed them that had need of healing,~
He fed their hunger with ghostly meat. Thus it is that no man taketh Christ's~
meat, unless he be first healed, and they, that are bidden to the supper, are~
first cured by the invitation. The lame receive the power to walk, that they may~
be able to come the blind cannot see the door of the house of the Lord, unless~
light be given them.

[Responsory8]
@Tempora/Pent01-0:Responsory8

[Lectio9]
Everywhere is preserved the order of the Sacraments. The sinful soul is first~
healed by the remission of sins, and afterward is filled at the Talfle of the~
Lord albeit this multitude now present is of such as do not yet feed on~
those strong meats, nor pasture their starving spirits upon the Body and Blood~
of Christ, as do they of a manlier faith. To use the words of Paul, "I have fed~
you with milk and not with meat, for hitherto ye were not able to bear it,~
neither yet now are ye able." (1 Cor. iii. 2.) The five loaves are, as it were,~
your milk the stronger meat will be the Body of Christ the more generous cup,~
the Blood of the Lord.

[Ant 2]
The multitude being very great, * and having nothing to eat, Jesus called His~
disciples unto Him, and saith unto them I have compassion on the multitude,~
because they have now been with Me three days, and have nothing to eat.~
Alleluia.

[Versum 2]
V. The Lord reigneth He is clothed with majesty.
R. The Lord is clothed with strength, and hath girded Himself with power.

[Ant 3]
I have compassion on the multitude, * because they have now been with Me three~
days, and have nothing to eat and if I send them away fasting, they will faint~
by the way. Alleluia.

[Versum 3]
V. Let my prayer, O Lord, be set forth.
R. As incense before thee.
