[Ant Vespera]
Dum esset Rex * in accubitu suo, nardus mea dedit odorem suavitatis.
Et concupiscet Rex * decorem tuum, quia ipse est Dominus Deus tuus.
Potens in opere * et sermone, lenivit iracundiam Domini, et conciliavit cor patris ad filium.
Ouasi arcus refulgens * inter nebulas gloriae, et quasi fios rosarum in diebus vernis.
Quasi stella matutina * in medio ambulae, et quasi luna plena in diebus suis.

[Hymnus Vespera]
v. Pure, meek, with soul serene,
Sweeter to her it was to serve unseen
Her God, than reign a queen.
_
Now far above our sight,
Enthroned upon the star-paved azure height,
She reigns in realms of light;
_
So long as time shall flow,
Teaching to all who sit on thrones below,
The good that power can do.
_
To God, the Sire and Son
And Paraclete, be glory, Trine in One,
While endless ages run. 
Ámen.

[Versum 1]
V. Ora pro nobis beata Elisabeth.
R. Ut digni efficiamur promissionibus Christi.

[Ant 1]
Et nunc * reges intelligite, erudimini qui judicatis terram.

[Oratio]
O most merciful God, Who didst ennoble the blessed Queen Isabel with divers~
excellent graces, and withal with a gift of stilling the tempest of war, grant~
unto us through her pleading, in this dying life that peace for which we humbly~
pray, and hereafter to attain unto everlasting joy in thy Presence.

[Lectio4]
Elisabeth, daughter of Peter III., King of Aragon, was born in the year of~
Christ 1271, and it was an omen of her saintly life; that her father and mother,~
contrary to the usual custom, caused her to be baptized, not by the name of her~
mother or grandmother, but by that of her mother's aunt, the holy Lady Elizabeth~
of Thuringia. As soon as ever she was born, her destiny of being a peacemaker~
between kings and kingdoms began to appear, for the joy of her birth put an end~
to the ruinous quarrels of her father and grandfather. As she grew up, her~
father, delighted with her disposition, was used to foretell that his Isabel~
would in herself excel all the daughters of the kingly house of Aragon, and that~
the happiness of his own home and kingdom was all owing to this one damsel,~
whose heavenly life he venerated for her indifference to bodily finery, her~
abstinence from pleasures, her many fasts, her instancy in prayer to God, and~
her activity in doing works of charity. This illustrious maiden was sought in~
marriage by many princes, and at twelve years of age was wedded with Christian~
rites to Denys, King of Portugal.

[Lectio5]
As a wife, she gave herself up as much to the education of her children, as to~
her own improvement, striving in all ways, next to God, to please her husband.~
For nearly half the year, she was used to live on bread and water, and once,~
when she was ill, God changed the water into wine, which the physicians had~
ordered her to drink, but which she was unwilling to take. Once when she kissed a~
disgusting ulcer in a poor woman, it was immediately healed. One winter-time~
when she was giving some money to the poor, and was fain her husband should not~
see her alms, the coins changed into roses. She gave sight to a maiden who had~
been born blind, and healed many other persons of grievous sicknesses by the~
Sign of the Cross. The miracles of this kind, which she worked, were many. She~
not only built, but richly endowed convents, schools, and churches. She had a~
wonderful skill in making peace between kings, and toiled unweariedly to lighten~
all suffering, whether public or private.

[Lectio6]
King Denys died (on the 6th day of January, 1325,) and Isabel, who in her~
maidenhood had been a pattern to virgins, and in her married life to wives, now,~
in her loneliness, was an ensample to widows. Clad in the raiment of the nuns of~
St Clare, she faithfully attended at the King's funeral, and soon after went to~
Compostella, where she offered many precious gifts, of silk, and gold, and~
silver, and precious stones, for the benefit of his soul. Thence she returned~
home, and spent in holy and godly uses everything that remained to her that was~
dear and costly, eager to relieve every kind of suffering. She lived, not for~
herself, but for God, and to be useful to mankind. She finished the convent for~
nuns, right worthy of a Queen, which she had founded at Coi'mbra. She fed the~
poor, defended widows, protected orphans. A war being lighted up between her son~
Alphonsus IV., King of Portugal, and her grandson Alphonsus XL, King of Castile,~
she resolved to set out to reconcile them, and went to the famous city of~
Estremoz, upon the borders of the two kingdoms. On the journey, she caught a~
violent fever, of which, after a vision of the Virgin Mother of God, she died a~
saintly death on the 4th day of July, in the year 1336. She became illustrious'~
for miracles after her death, especially for the sweetness of the savour of her~
body, which hath now remained uncorrupt for well-nigh three hundred years, and~
she hath always been spoken of as the Holy Queen Isabel. At length, in the year~
of our salvation 1625, which was that of the Jubilee, Urban VIII., all~
Christendom gathered together and approving, formally enrolled her name among~
those of the Saints.

[Hymnus Laudes]
Opes decusque regium reliqueras
Elisabeth, Dei dicata numini:
Recepta nunc bearis inter Angelos:
Libens ab hostium tuere nos dolis.
_
Praei, viamque dux salutis indica:
Sequemur: O sit una mens fidelium,
Odor bonus sit omnis actio, tuis
Id innuit rosis operta caritas.
_
Beata caritas, in arce siderum
Potens locare nos per omne saeculum:
Patrique, Filioque summa gloria,
Tibique laus perennis alme Spiritus.
Ámen.
