Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus
!Sir 24:14-16
Before all ages, in the beginning, He created me, and through all ages I shall not cease to be. In the holy Tent I ministered before Him, and in Sion I fixed my abode. Thus in the chosen city He has given me rest, in Jerusalem is my domain. I have struck root among the glorious people, in the portion of my God, His heritage, and my abode is in the full assembly of Saints.

V. After childbirth you still remained an inviolate virgin: O Mother of God,~
intercede for us. Alleluia.
