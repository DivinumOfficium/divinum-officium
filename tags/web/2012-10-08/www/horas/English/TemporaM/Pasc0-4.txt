From the Holy Gospel according to John.
!John 20:11-18
At that time: But Mary stood at the sepulchre without, weeping. Now as she was~
weeping, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre, And follows.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great.)
!25th on the Gospels.
Mary Magdalene, a woman in the city, who was a sinner, through love of the truth~
washed away by her tears the befoulment of her sin, and the word of the Truth~
was fulfilled which He spake : Her sins, which are many, are forgiven : for she~
loved much. (Luke vii. 47.) She that had remained cold while she sinned, became~
burning when she loved. For after that she had been to the Sepulchre, and had~
not found there the Body of the Lord, and had believed that It had been taken~
away, and had told His disciples, they came and saw, and thought it was even as~
the woman had said : and it is written Then the disciples went away again unto~
their own home but Mary stood without at the sepulchre, weeping.

[Responsory1]
R. They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid Him. The~
Angels say unto her : Woman, why weepest thou? He is risen, as He said.
* He goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see Him. Alleluia, Alleluia.
V. And as she wept, she stooped down and looked into the Sepulchre, and saw two~
Angels in white, sitting; and they say unto her :
R. He goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see Him. Alleluia, Alleluia.

[Lectio2]
In connection with this matter, we ought to ponder what great store of love~
there was in that woman's heart, who, when even His disciples were gone away,~
could not tear herself from the' grave of the Lord. She sought Him Whom she had~
not found there, and as she sought, she wept, and the fire of love in her heart~
yearned after Him, Who she believed had been taken away. And so it came to pass~
that she, who had lingered to seek Him, was the only one who then saw Him, since~
the back-bone of a good work is endurance, and the voice of the Truth Himself~
hath said : He that endureth to the end shall be saved. (Matth. x. 22; xxiv.~
13.)

[Responsory2]
R. Rejoice with me, all ye that love the Lord : for I sought Him and He hath~
appeared unto me
* And while as I was weeping at the Sepulchre, I saw the Lord. Alleluia,~
Alleluia.
V. When His disciples were gone away, I tarried still; and the fire of love in~
mine heart glowed for Him.
R. And while as I was weeping at the Sepulchre, I saw the Lord. Alleluia,~
Alleluia.
&Gloria
R. And while as I was weeping at the Sepulchre, I saw the Lord. Alleluia,~
Alleluia.

[Lectio3]
As Mary wept there, she stooped down and looked into the Sepulchre. It was but a~
little while and she had seen how the Sepulchre was empty, and had told that the~
Lord was taken away. Why then should she stoop down and look in again? But she~
loved Him so well, that one look was not enough; the energy of her affection~
constrained her to search again and again. She began by searching and not~
finding; but she endured in her search, and, behold, it came to pass that she~
found. And this was done that our own longings for Christ's presence might be~
taught to expand, and know that as they expand they will meet with Him to Whom~
they aspire.
&teDeum

[Ant 2]
Mary stood without at the Sepulchre weeping, * and saw two Angels in white,~
sitting, and the napkin that had been about the Head of Jesus. Alleluia.

[Oratio 2]
O God, Who dost make all nations, how diverse soever they be, to become one~
family in giving of praise to thy Name, grant unto all them that are born again~
in the fountain of baptism to live ever in oneness of faith, and godliness of~
works.
$Per Dominum

[Ant 3]
They have taken away my Lord, * and I know not where they have laid Him : if~
thou have borne Him hence, tell me, Alleluia, and I will take Him away. Alleluia.

v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 20:11-18
20:11 But Mary stood at the sepulchre without, weeping. Now as she was weeping, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre,
20:12 And she saw two angels in white, sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been laid.
20:13 They say to her: Woman, why weepest thou? She saith to them: Because they have taken away my Lord; and I know not where they have laid him.
20:14 When she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing; and she knew not that it was Jesus.
20:15 Jesus saith to her: Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, thinking it was the gardener, saith to him: Sir, if thou hast taken him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.
20:16 Jesus saith to her: Mary. She turning, saith to him: Rabboni (which is to say, Master).
20:17 Jesus saith to her: Do not touch me, for I am not yet ascended to my Father. But go to my brethren, and say to them: I ascend to my Father and to your Father, to my God and your God.
20:18 Mary Magdalen cometh, and telleth the disciples: I have seen the Lord, and these things he said to me.
