Lesson from the book of Abdias
!Obad 1:1-4
1  The vision of Abdias. Thus saith the Lord God to Edom: We have heard a rumour from the Lord, and he hath sent an ambassador to the nations: Arise, and let us rise up to battle against him.
2  Behold I have made thee small among the nations: thou art exceeding contemptible.
3  The pride of thy heart hath lifted thee up, who dwellest in the clefts of the rocks, and settest up thy throne on high: who sayest in thy heart: Who shall bring me down to the ground
4  Though thou be exalted as an eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars: thence will I bring thee down, saith the Lord.

!Obad 1:5-7
5  If thieves had gone in to thee, if robbers by night, how wouldst thou have held thy peace? would they not have stolen till they had enough if the grapegatherers had come in to thee, would they not have left thee at the least a cluster?
6  How have they searched Esau, how have they sought out his hidden things?
7  They have sent thee out even to the border: all the men of thy confederacy have deceived thee: the men of thy peace have prevailed against thee: they that eat with thee shall lay snares under thee: there is no wisdom in him.

!Obad 1:8-11
8  Shall not I in that day, saith the Lord, destroy the wise out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau
9  And thy valiant men of the south shall be afraid, that man may be cut off from the mount of Esau.
10  For the slaughter, and for the iniquity against thy brother Jacob, confusion shall cover thee, and thou shalt perish for ever.
11  In the day when thou stoodest against him, when strangers carried away his army captive, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem: thou also wast as one of them.
