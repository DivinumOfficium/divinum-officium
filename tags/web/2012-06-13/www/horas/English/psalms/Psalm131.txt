131:1 (A gradual canticle.) O Lord, remember David, and all his meekness.
131:2 How he swore to the Lord, he vowed a vow to the God of Jacob:
131:3 If I shall enter into the tabernacle of my house: if I shall go up into the bed wherein I lie:
131:4 If I shall give sleep to my eyes, or slumber to my eyelids,
131:5 Or rest to my temples: until I find out a place for the Lord, a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.
131:6 Behold we have heard of it in Ephrata: we have found it in the fields of the wood.
131:7 We will go into his tabernacle: we will adore in the place where his feet stood.
131:8 Arise, O Lord, into thy resting place: thou and the ark, which thou hast sanctified.
131:9 Let thy priests be clothed with justice: and let thy saints rejoice.
131:10 For thy servant David's sake, turn not away the face of thy anointed.
131:11 The Lord hath sworn truth to David, and he will not make it void: of the fruit of thy womb I will set upon thy throne.
131:12 If thy children will keep my covenant, and these my testimonies which I shall teach them: Their children also for evermore shall sit upon thy throne.
131:13 For the Lord hath chosen Sion: he hath chosen it for his dwelling.
131:14 This is my rest for ever and ever: here will I dwell, for I have chosen it.
131:15 Blessing I will bless her widow: I will satisfy her poor with bread.
131:16 I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints shall rejoice with exceeding great joy.
131:17 There will I bring forth a horn to David: I have prepared a lamp for my anointed.
131:18 His enemies I will clothe with confusion: but upon him shall my sanctification flourish.
