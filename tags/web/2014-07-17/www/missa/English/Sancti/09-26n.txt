Lesson from the second letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians
!2 Cor. 12:11-15
Brethren: I ought to have been commended by you, since in no way have I fallen short of the most eminent apostles, even though I am nothing. Indeed, the signs of the apostles were wrought among you in all patience, in miracles and wonders and deeds of prayer. For in what have you been less favored than the other churches - unless in this, that I was no burden to you? Pardon me this wrong! Behold this is the third time that I am ready to come to you. And I will not be a burden to you; for I do not seek yours, but you. For the children should not save up for the parents, but the parents for the children. But I will most gladly spend and be spent myself for your souls, even though, loving you more, I be loved less.

!Ps 123:7-8
We were rescued like a bird from the fowlers’ snare.
V. Broken was the snare, and we were freed. Our help is in the name of the Lord,~
Who made heaven and earth. Alleluia, alleluia.
!2 Cor 1:5
V. As the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so also through Christ does our~
comfort abound. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 6:17-23
At that time, Jesus coming down from the mountain, took His stand on a level~
stretch, with a crowd of His disciples, and a great multitude of people from all~
Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to listen to~
Him and to be healed of their diseases. And those who were troubled with unclean~
spirits were cured. And all the crowd were trying to touch Him, for power went~
forth from Him and healed all. And He lifted up His eyes to His disciples and~
said, Blessed are you poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. Blessed are you who~
hunger now, for you shall be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you~
shall laugh. Blessed shall you be when men hate you, and when they shut you out,~
and reproach you, and reject your name as evil, because of the Son of Man.~
Rejoice on that day and exult, for behold your reward is great in heaven.

[Offertorium]
!Wis 3:6
As gold in the furnace the Lord proved them, and as sacrificial offerings He~
took them to Himself.

which the spotless purity of life and the continual zeal of mortification~
rendered a most delightful banquet for Your blessed Martyrs.

truth.
