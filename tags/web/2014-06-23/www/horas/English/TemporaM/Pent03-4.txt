Lesson from the first book of Samuel
!1 Sam 14:6-11
6 And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armour: Come, let us go over~
to the garrison of these uncircumcised, it may be the Lord will do for us,~
because it is easy for the Lord to save either by many, or by few.
7 And his armourbearer said to him: Do all that pleaseth thy mind: go whither~
thou wilt, and I will be with thee wheresoever thou hast a mind.
8 And Jonathan said: Behold we will go over to these men. And when we shall be~
seen by them,
9 If they shall speak thus to us: Stay till we come to you: let us stand still~
in our place, and not go up to them.
10 But if they shall say: Come up to us: let us go up, because the Lord hath~
delivered them into our hands, this shall be a sign unto us.
11 So both of them discovered themselves to the garrison of the Philistines: and~
the Philistines said: Behold the Hebrews come forth out of the holes wherein~
they were hid.

!1 Sam 14:12-15
12 And the men of the garrison spoke to Jonathan, and to his armourbearer, and~
said: Come up to us, and we will show you a thing. And Jonathan said to his~
armourbearer: Let us go up, follow me: for the Lord hath delivered them into the~
hands of Israel.
13 And Jonathan went up creeping on his hands and feet, and his armourbearer~
after him. And some fell before Jonathan, others his armourbearer slew as he~
followed him.
14 And the first slaughter which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was of~
about twenty men, within half an acre of land, which a yoke of oxen is wont to~
plough in a day.
15 And there was a miracle in the camp, through the fields: yea and all the~
people of their garrison, who had gone out to plunder, were amazed, and the~
earth trembled: and it happened as a miracle from God.

!1 Sam 14:16-20
16 And the watchmen of Saul, who were in Gabaa of Benjamin looked, and behold a~
multitude overthrown, and fleeing this way and that.
17 And Saul said to the people that were with him: Look, and see who is gone~
from us. And when they had sought, it was found that Jonathan and his~
armourbearer were not there.
18 And Saul said to Achias: Bring the ark of the Lord. (For the ark of God was~
there that day with the children of Israel.)
19 And while Saul spoke to the priest, there arose a great uproar in the camp of~
the Philistines: and it increased by degrees, and was heard more clearly. And~
Saul said to the priest: Draw in thy hand.
20 Then Saul and all the people that were with him, shouted together, and they~
came to the place of the fight: and behold every man's sword was turned upon his~
neighbour, and there was a very great slaughter.
