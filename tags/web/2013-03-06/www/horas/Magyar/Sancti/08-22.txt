!Song 8:5-6
5 Ki az ott, aki a puszta felõl erre tart és a szerelmesére támaszkodik? Az~
almafa alatt keltettelek föl. Ott, ahol vajúdni kezdett veled anyád, ahol kínok~
közt fetrengett, aki megszült.
6 Tegyél a szívedre pecsétnek, mint valami pecsétet a karodra! Mert mint a halál,~
olyan erõs a szerelem, olyan a szenvedély, mint az alvilág. Nyila tüzes nyíl, az~
Úrnak lángja.

!Song 8:7-9
7 Tengernyi víz sem olthatja el a szerelmet, egész folyamok sem tudnák~
elsodorni. Ha valaki háza egész vagyonát felkínálná is a szerelemért, azt is~
kevesellnék!
8 Van egy kis húgunk, még kicsi, melle sincs. Mit tegyünk húgunkkal, hogyha majd~
megkérik?
9 Hogyha fal, építsünk fölé ezüsttetõt, ha ajtó, takarjuk el cédruspalánkkal.

!Song 8:10-13;
10 Fal vagyok, és a melleim, mint a tornyok, ezért nyertem meg a szeme~
tetszését.
11 Baal-Hamonban Salamonnak volt egy szõleje. Csõszökre bízta a szõlejét; ezer~
ezüst sékelt kellett fizetnie mindegyiknek a termésért.
12 Elõttem a szõlõ, most az enyém; Salamon, az ezer ezüst legyen a tied,~
kétszázat meg kapjanak a termés õrei.
13 Te, aki a kertekben laksz, a barátaim lesik szavaidat, hallasd hangodat!

From the Sermons of St Bernard, Abbat of Clairvaux.
!4th on the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin.
There is nothing which giveth me keener pleasure or keener fear than to have to~
speak of the glory of the Virgin Mary. Behold if I praise her virginity, many~
virgins come before me, who bear her company, and, after her, are brought unto~
the King. (Ps. xliv. 16.) If I proclaim her lowliness, there will some be found,~
few though they may be, who have learnt of her Son to be meek and lowly in~
heart. (Matth. xi. 29.) If I extol the multitude of her mercies, there are men~
who are also merciful yea, and women. But there is one thing wherein Neither~
before nor henceforth hath there been or shall be such another, The joy of a~
Mother was hers, remaining a virgin unsullied. This is the peculiar grace of~
Mary, which will never be another's. This standeth alone, and what it is words~
can never really tell.

Neverthless, if thou gazest thoughtfully upon her, thou wilt see that her virgin~
motherhood was not the only grace which was peculiar to Mary alone, although, at~
first sight, her graces other than her motherhood seem to have been possessed by~
others as well as by herself. Where, for example, even among Angels, canst thou~
find any purity such as that of her maidenhood, her maidenhood, which was meet~
to become the shrine of the Holy Ghost, and the dwelling of the Son of God Again,~
what must have been the greatness and price of lowliness in one, whose purity~
and whose guilelessness were what her's were, whose conscience never could or~
did, ever so gently, reproach her with anything, and who was actually filled~
full of grace (Lukei. 28.) Blessed being how came it that, thou couldest be~
lowly at all, far less, lowly as thou wast Worthy in good sooth was His~
handmaiden that the Lord should regard her lowliness (48), that the King should~
greatly desire her beauty, (Ps. xliv. 13,) and that the unspeakable savour of~
her perfumes should lure Him from His eternal rest in the bosom of the Father.

Behold, blessed maiden with what congratulations we have been able, though from~
so far off, to follow and cheer thee on thy way as thou goest up unto thy Son~
May it be the work of thy kindness to show to the world what grace thou hast~
found with God, by procuring, through thy holy prayers, pardon for the guilty,~
health for the sick, courage for the faint-hearted, help and deliverance for the~
endangered. Yea, in this solemn day of His joy and of the gladness of His Heart,~
~(Cant. iii. 11,) may our Lord Jesus Christ thy Son be pleased to make a special~
out-pouring of His grace through thee, O merciful Queen upon all who are calling~
upon the sweet name of Mary. He is over all, God, blessed for ever. Ámen.

!Luke 10:38-42
Abban az idõben Jézus betért egy faluba. Egy Márta nevû asszony befogadta~
házába. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Bernard, Abbat (of Clairvaux.) (2nd on the Assumption of the~
Blessed Virgin.) Why should we speak of Jesus having entered into a village? He~
entered even into the narrow lodging of a Virgin's womb. And a certain woman~
received Him into her house. Happy was that woman whose house the Saviour, Whom~
she received therein, found clean but not empty. For how can any man say that~
she was empty whom an Angel hailed as full of grace Nor this only, but also~
declared that the Holy Ghost was about to come upon her. And wherefore, thinkest~
thou, should He come but to fill her unto overflowing Wherefore, but that she~
who was full when He came, should, when He came upon her, and the power of the~
Highest overshadowed her, brim over and overflow upon us

[Responsory7]
R. O Holy Virgin Mary, happy indeed art thou, and right worthy of all praise
* For out of thee rose the Sun of righteousness, even Christ our God.
V. Pray for the people, plead for the clergy, make intercession for all women~
vowed to God. May all that are keeping this thine solemn commemoration feel the might~
of thine assistance.
R. For out of thee rose the Sun of righteousness, even Christ our God.

[Lectio8]
Met the Saviour then enter into that house. Let Him oftentimes resort to that~
home cleansed by the repentant Lazarus, adorned by Martha, and hallowed by Mary~
to inward contemplation. But perchance some curious enquirer will ask why in the~
passage now read from the Gospel there is no mention made of Lazarus. I opine~
that it was to avoid anything which could mar the perfection of this house as a~
figure (of the womb of Mary.) The Holy Spirit willing to set forth a maidenly~
dwelling, hath been meetly silent touching repentance, which implieth the~
thought of evil. Let not this house be spoken of as ever having had any~
defilement for the broom of Lazarus to seek.

!Commemoratio for the Holy Martyrs.
Timothy came from Antioch to Rome in the time of Pope Melchiades. He had~
preached the faith of Christ there for a year, when he was thrown into irons by~
Tarquinius, Praefect of the city. After suffering a long imprisonment he was~
brought to the idols to offer them sacrifice. He refused right boldly to commit~
this great sin, and was thereupon savagely scourged, and his raw body covered~
with quick-lime. He steadily persisted in his testimony under these and other~
tortures, and at last was beheaded, (in the year 311.) His body is buried upon~
the road to Ostia, hard by the sepulchre of the blessed Apostle Paul. On the~
same day, under the Emperor Alexander, and at Ostia, Hippolytus, Bishop of Porto,~
on account of his illustrious confession of the faith, had his hands and feet~
bound, and was thrown into a deep pit full of water, and so received the crown~
of his testimony. The Christians buried him there. Also on the same day, (in the~
year 180,) under the Emperor Aurelian, and at Autun, the young lad Symphorian~
was tortured in divers ways for professing the same faith. As he was being led~
to die, he heard his mother crying out to him My child, my child think of life~
eternal Look to heaven and to Him That reigneth there! thy life is not being~
taken away, but changed for a better. And so, for Jesus Christ's sake, he~
bravely offered his neck to the executioner.
