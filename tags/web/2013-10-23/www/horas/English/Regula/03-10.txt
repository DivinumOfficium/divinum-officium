03-10# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 32: Concerning the Iron Tools and Other Things Belonging to the Monastery
_
Let the abbot appoint brethren of whose life and character he is assured and to them, as he shall judge fit, let him assign the property of the monastery, the various iron tools and the articles of clothing and all other things whatsoever, to be kept by them and re-collected after use. And of these let the abbot keep a list, so that he may know what he gives and what he receives back when the brethren succeed one another in turn in the work assigned to each. And if anyone shall have treated the property of the monastery in a slovenly or neglectful manner let him be corrected; and if he shall not have then amended, let him be subjected to the discipline of the rule.
