Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Romans
!Rom 8:1-4
8:1 There is now therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not according to the flesh.
8:2 For the law of the spirit of life, in Christ Jesus, hath delivered me from the law of sin and of death.
8:3 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh; God sending his own Son, in the likeness of sinful flesh and of sin, hath condemned sin in the flesh;
8:4 That the justification of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit.

[Lectio2]
!Rom 8:5-8
8:5 For they that are according to the flesh, mind the things that are of the flesh; but they that are according to the spirit, mind the things that are of the spirit.
8:6 For the wisdom of the flesh is death; but the wisdom of the spirit is life and peace.
8:7 Because the wisdom of the flesh is an enemy to God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither can it be.
8:8 And they who are in the flesh, cannot please God.

[Lectio3]
!Rom 8:9-11
8:9 But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
8:10 And if Christ be in you, the body indeed is dead, because of sin; but the spirit liveth, because of justification.
8:11 And if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead, dwell in you; he that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead, shall quicken also your mortal bodies, because of his Spirit that dwelleth in you.

A sermon of St. Augustine, Bishop.
!Serm. 13. de Tempore.
Our Lord Jesus Christ, dearest brethren, who in eternity is the Creator of all things, was as at this time born of a mother and became our Saviour.  It was as at this time that he willed to be born for us in earthly time, so as to lead us to the Father's eternity.  God is made man, that man may be made as God.  That man may eat Angels' food, the Lord of Angels was as on this day made man.

[Lectio5]
Now is fulfilled that prophecy: Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness: let the earth open, and bring forth a Saviour.  He who made all things is therefore himself made, that those who are lost may be found.  It is even as man is made to testify of himself in the Psalms: Before I was humbled, I went wrong.  Man sinned and became guilty.  God is born man, that the guilty may be delivered.  Man fell, but God descended.  Man fell miserably, God descended mercifully.  Man fell by pride, God descended with grace.

[Lectio6]
O my brethren, what a miracle! what a wonder!  The laws of nature are changed concerning man: God is born, a Virgin conceiveth without an husband; the Word of God is wedded to one who knoweth no man; she is at once Mother and Virgin.  A Mother, yet inviolate: a Virgin having a Son; knowing no man, ever sealed, yet not unfruitful.  For he alone was born without sin.  He alone was born without human embrace, begotten not of the will of the flesh, but of the obedience of the mind.

From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 2:19-23
In that time when Herod was dead, behold an angel of the Lord appeared in sleep~
to Joseph in Egypt, Saying: Arise, and take the child and his mother, and go~
into the land of Israel. And so on.
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Bk. i., Comm. on Matth. ii.
From the words, they are dead, (in the Plural), which are used in this passage~
of the Gospel, we may understand that there were others beside Herod which~
sought the young Child's life probably the Priests and Scribes. And he Joseph~
arose, and took the young Child and His Mother. It is not written, He took his~
wife and child, but he took the young Child and His Mother; whence it is clear~
that the holy Evangelist willeth to imply that Joseph was not the father, but~
the Guardian of Jesus, not the husband, but the Betrothed of Mary.

[Lectio8]
 But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judea, in the room of his father~
Herod, he was afraid to go thither. There are some persons so grossly ignorant~
of history that they confuse themselves over the two Herods, as if the one~
mentioned here were the same who afterwards set our Lord at nought during His~
Passion, and they cannot understand how he should now be said to be dead. The~
Herod who was made friends with Pilate over Christ's death, was the son of the~
Herod who massacred the infants of Bethlehem, and the brother of Archelaus.

[Lectio9]
 He shall be called a Nazarene. The Evangelist, in quoting these words, saith~
that they were spoken by the Prophets, (Plural). If he had been citing any one~
precise passage he would have said by the Prophet, in the Singular. But he is~
citing the sense of the Prophets, and not any individual passage in any of their~
writings. He seemeth to refer to the fact that in Hebrew the word Nazarene~
signifieth holy, and that Christ is the Holy One of God is the common~
declaration of all the Scriptures.
