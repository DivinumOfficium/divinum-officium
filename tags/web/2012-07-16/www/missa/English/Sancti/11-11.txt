Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus
!Sir 44:16-27: 45:3-20
Behold, a great priest, who in his days pleased God, and was found just; and in the time of wrath he was made a reconciliation. There was not found the like to him, who kept the law of the Most High. Therefore, by an oath, the Lord made him to increase among his people. He gave him the blessing of all nations, and confirmed His covenant upon his head. He acknowledged him in His blessings; He preserved for him His mercy; and he found grace before the eyes of the Lord. He glorified him in the sight of kings, and gave him a crown of glory. He made an everlasting covenant with him, and gave him a great priesthood; and made him blessed in glory. To execute the office of the priesthood, and to have praise in His name, and to offer Him a worthy incense for an odor of sweetness.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 11:33-36
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples, No one lights a lamp and puts it in a~
cellar or even under the measure, but upon the lamp-stand, that they who enter~
in may see the light. The lamp of your body is your eye. If your eye be sound,~
your whole body will be full of light. But if it be evil, your body also will be~
full of darkness. Take care, therefore, that the light that is in you is not~
darkness. If, then, your whole body is full of light, having no part in darkness,~
it will all be illumined, as when a bright lamp illumines you.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 88:25
My faithfulness and My kindness shall be with him, and through My name shall his~
horn be exalted.
