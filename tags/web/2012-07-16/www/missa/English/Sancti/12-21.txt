Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians
!Eph 2:19-22
Brethren: You are now no longer strangers and foreigners, but you are citizens with the saints and members of God’s household: you are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets with Christ Jesus Himself as the chief cornerstone. In Him the whole structure is closely fitted together and grows into a temple holy in the Lord, in Him you too are being built together into a dwelling place for God in the Spirit.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 20:24-29
At that time, Thomas, one of the Twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when~
Jesus came. The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the Lord.~
But he said to them, Unless I see in His hands the print of the nails, and put~
my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will not~
believe. And after eight days, His disciples were again inside, and Thomas with~
them. Jesus came, the doors being closed, and stood in their midst, and said,~
Peace be to you! Then He said to Thomas, Bring here your finger, and see My~
hands; and bring here your hand, and put it into My side; and be not unbelieving,~
but believing. Thomas answered and said to Him, ‘My Lord and my God! Jesus said~
to him, Because you have seen Me, Thomas, you have believed. Blessed are they~
who have not seen, and yet have believed.
