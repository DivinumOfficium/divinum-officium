[Lectio]
Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians
!Eph 3:13-21
Brethren: I pray you not to be disheartened at my tribulations for you, for they are your glory. For this reason I bend my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, from Whom all fatherhood in heaven and on earth receives its name, that He may grant you from His glorious riches to be strengthened with power through His Spirit unto the progress of the inner man; and to have Christ dwelling through faith in your hearts: so that, being rooted and grounded in love, you may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know Christ’s love which surpasses knowledge, in order that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God. Now, to Him Who is able to accomplish all things in a measure far beyond what we ask or conceive, in keeping with the power that is at work in us - to Him be glory in the Church and in Christ Jesus down through all the ages of time without end. Amen.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 14:1-11
At that time, when Jesus entered the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees~
on the Sabbath to take food, they watched Him. And behold, there was a certain~
man before Him who had the dropsy. And Jesus asked the lawyers and Pharisees,~
saying, Is it lawful to cure on the Sabbath? But they remained silent. And He~
took and healed him and let him go. Then addressing them, He said, Which of you~
shall have an ass or an ox fall into a pit, and will not immediately draw him up~
on the Sabbath? And they could give Him no answer to these things. But He also~
spoke a parable to those invited, observing how they were choosing the first~
places at table, and He said to them, When you are invited to a wedding feast,~
do not recline in the first place, lest perhaps one more distinguished than you~
have been invited by him, and he who invited you and him come and say to you,~
‘Make room for this man’; and then you begin with shame to take the last place.~
But when you are invited go and recline in the last place; that when he who~
invited you comes in, he may say to you, ‘Friend, go up higher!’ Then you will~
be honored in the presence of all who are at table with you. For everyone who~
exalts himself shall be humbled, and he who humbles himself shall be exalted.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 39:14-15
Deign, O Lord, to rescue me; let all be put to shame and confusion who seek to~
snatch away my life. Deign, O Lord, to rescue me.

[Secreta]
Cleanse us by this sacrifice, we beseech You, O Lord, and by the workings of~
Your mercy, make us worthy to receive it.

[Communio]
!Ps 70:16-18
O Lord, I will tell of Your singular justice; O God, You have taught me from my~
youth; and now that I am old and gray, O God, forsake me not.

O Lord, we beseech You, graciously cleanse and renew our minds with the heavenly~
sacrament, so we may thereby also receive bodily help for the present as well as~
for the future.
