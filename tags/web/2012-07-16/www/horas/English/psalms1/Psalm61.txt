61:1 Shall not my soul be subject to God? * for from him is my salvation
61:2 For he is my God and my saviour: * he is my protector, I shall be moved no more.
61:3 How long do you rush in upon a man? * you all kill, as if you were thrusting down a leaning wall, and a tottering fence.
61:4 But they have thought to cast away my price; I ran in thirst: * they blessed with their mouth, but cursed with their heart.
61:5 But be thou, O my soul, subject to God: * for from him is my patience.
61:6 For he is my God and my saviour: * he is my helper, I shall not be moved.
61:7 In God is my salvation and my glory: * he is the God of my help, and my hope is in God.
61:8 Trust in him, all ye congregation of people: pour out your hearts before him. * God is our helper for ever.
61:9 But vain are the sons of men, the sons of men are liars in the balances: * that by vanity they may together deceive.
61:10 Trust not in iniquity, and cover not robberies: * if riches abound, set not your heart upon them.
61:11 God hath spoken once, these two things have I heard, that power belongeth to God, and mercy to thee, O Lord; * for thou wilt render to every man according to his works.
