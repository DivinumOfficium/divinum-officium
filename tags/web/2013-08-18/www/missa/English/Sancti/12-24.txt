Paul, the servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an Apostle, set apart for the Gospel of God, which He had promised before-hand through His prophets in the Holy Scriptures, concerning His Son Who was born to Him according to the flesh of the offspring of David; Who was foreordained Son of God by an act of power in keeping with the holiness of His spirit, by resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord, through Whom we have received the grace of apostleship to bring about obedience to faith among all the nations for His name’s sake; among whom are you also called to be Jesus Christ’s, our Lord.

Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt. 1:18-21
When Mary, the Mother of Jesus, has been betrothed to Joseph, before they came~
together, she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit. But Joseph her~
husband, being a just man, and not wishing to expose her to reproach, was minded~
to put her away privately. But while he thought on these things, behold, an~
angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Do not be afraid, Joseph,~
son of David, to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is begotten in her~
is of the Holy Spirit. And she shall bring forth a Son, and you shall call His~
name Jesus; for He shall save His people from their sins.
