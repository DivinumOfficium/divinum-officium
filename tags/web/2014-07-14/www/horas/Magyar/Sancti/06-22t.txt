O God, Who, year by year, dost gladden us by the solemn feast-day of thy blessed confessor Paulin, mercifully grant unto all who keep his birthday, grace to follow after the pattern of his godly conversation.

[Lectio2]
Paulinus, Bishop of Nola, (was born at Bordeaux in the year 353. He) was learned in refined knowledge, and in the Holy Scriptures, and was the author of many elegant and polished poems and discourses. The trait in him which is most celebrated, is his charity. (In 410,) when the Goths ravaged Campania, [where he had a large property,) he spent the whole of his substance, without leaving to himself even the necessaries of life, in feeding the destitute and ransoming the captives. 

[Lectio3]
At this time, as writeth St Austin, from having been a man of great wealth, he of his own free will made himself an absolute beggar, but a most glorious Saint, and when the Barbarians took him prisoner, he said to God Lord, let them not torture me for the sake of my gold and silver, for Thou knowest whither it is all gone. When the Vandals afterwards harried the same country, a widow came to him, beseeching him that he would ransom her son, and, because he had spent all in works of mercy, he gave himself up to slavery in her son's stead. As a slave he was carried over to Africa, where his owner, who was the King's son-in-law, gave him his garden to keep. But when, through the gift of prophecy, he foretold to his master the King's death, and the King himself in a dream beheld Paulinus sitting between two judges, and wresting the whip out of his hands, his greatness was acknowledged and he was honourably set at large, all his fellow-citizens who were also his fellow -prisoners being freely gifted to him. He went back to Nola to be Bishop there, and by his word and example to stir up all men to Christian godliness. In the midst of his work he was stricken down by a pain in the side, and the chamber where he lay being shaken by an earthquake, he presently resigned his soul to God, (in the year 431.)
