O God, who didst deign wonderfully to rise up blessed John thy confessor, for the propagation of the faith among the Gentiles, and through him didst organize in Thy Church a new family for the instruction of the faithful, grant to us, Thy servants, so to profit by his works that we may attain unto eternal rewards

[Lectio4]
Joannes Leonardi, in oppido Decimi, non longe a Lucensi urbe, piis et honestis ortus parentibus, jam inde a prima aetate, solitudinis et precationis amore, grave quiddam ac maturum prae se tulit. Annos natus viginti sex a Deo vocatus ad ecclesiasticae militiae nomen dandum, saecularibus cum illico nuntium remisit. Ac primo inter pueros latinae linguae rudimentis instinctus, deinde in litteris et philosophicis ac theologicis disciplinis adeo profecit, ut vix acto quadriennio ad sacerdotium ex obedientia promotus fuerit. Mox aliquot nactus bonae indolis nobiles juvenes, cum eos nil virtutis perfectionem sedulo exercuisset, insequenti anno Congregationem instituit Clericorum Regularium, quam a Matre Dei, ob in censum erga ipsam suae devotionis affectum, nuncupavit. Horum cura et zelo tanta peracta est animorum commutatio, ut cum in Lucensi republica, haereticorum praesertim perfidiosis artibus, arderent civium odia, profligatique essent mores, brevi tempora primaeva Christianorum pietas ibidem revixisse vedetur.

Tam salutarium operum causa incidit Joannes in acerrimas insectationes hominum nequam, qui recens coactam familiam perdere omni ope conati sunt. Sed vir Dei, aequo animo libenter omnia ferens, impetrata Summo Pontifice Gregorio decimo tertio suae Congregationis confirmatione, apostolici sui laboris fructus constanter servavit. In arduis negotiis componendis multi episcopi eo consiliario et adjutore usi sunt, et vel ipse Romanus Pontifex eum delegavit ad intricata litigia dirigenda, et ad religiosas familia reformandas. Sancto Josepho Calasantio, eiusque pene collapse societati, praesto fuit. Haud leve quocumque impendit operam negotiis nosocomii Sancti Spiritus in Saxia, et monialibus oblatis Sanctae Franciscae Romanae excolendis.

Graviter dolens, gentes adeo plurimas remotis in regionibus luce Evangelii carere, inflammabatur desiderio migrandi in illas oras ad lumen verge religionis effundendum. At cum intellexisset a sancto Philippo Nerio, a quo verus reformator dicebatur, se suamque Congregationem ad instituendos Italiae populos destinari, divinae acquievit voluntati; minime tamen abstinuit quin, si aliquam infidelibus opem afferre posset, experiretur. Hinc initis consiliis sum piissimo praesule Vives, coetum instituit presbyterorum, quibus propositum esset idoneos informare adolescentes, in dissitas regiones subinde mittendos ad fidem propagandam. Quare merito veluti auctor censetur praeclarissimi illius instituti, quod summorum Pontificum opera amplificatum, proferendae per universum orbem catholicae fidei mirabiliter inservit. Plura opera de re sacra et morali conscripsit, cuivis hominum conditione accommodatissima. Denique a sacro ministerio numquam deficiens, in cinere et cilicio ad Dominum migravit Romae, die nona Octobris, anno millesimo sexcentesimo nono, aetatis sexagesimo sexto. Quem sanctitatis et miraculis illustrem Pius nonus Pontifex Maximus Beatorum fastis accensuit. Pius vero undecimus, anno millesimo nongentesimo trigesimo octavo, die solemni Paschae, inter Sanctos adscripsit.

$Oremus
O God, Who, as upon this day, didst make thy blessed Witness and Bishop Denys~
strong to wrestle and to suffer, and Who wast pleased to give unto him, for~
fellow workers in declaring thy glory among the heathen, thy servants Rusticus~
and Eleutherius, grant unto us, we beseech thee, to be like unto them in~
esteeming the good things of this world but lightly, and in fearing not at all~
the evil things of the same.

Denys was an Athenian, one of the Judges of the Court of the Areopagus, and a~
man of varied and deep learning. There is a story concerning him that on the day~
when the Lord Christ was nailed to the Cross, and when he saw the unnatural~
eclipse of the sun, Denys said Either the God of nature is suffering, or the~
frame-work of the world is breaking up. When the Apostle Paul came to Athens,~
and was taken and brought unto the Areopagus, and gave an account of the faith~
which he preached, affirming that Christ had risen from the dead, and that all~
the dead likewise are to live again, some mocked, and others said We will~
hear thee again of this matter. So Paul departed from among them. Howbeit,~
certain men clave unto him, and believed among the which was Dionysius the~
Areopagite. (Acts xvii. 3234)~
Denys was baptized by the Apostle, and set over the Church of the Athenians. He~
came afterwards to Rome, and was sent by Pope Clement into Gaul, to preach the~
Gospel. There followed him to Paris one Rusticus a Priest, and Eleutherius a~
Deacon. He turned many to Christ, and was therefore hided with rods by command~
of Fescennius the Praefect, and, forasmuch as he still went on bravely preaching~
Christ, he was tortured with fire upon a grating, and put to divers other~
torments, and his comrades likewise.~
They bore their torments bravely and cheerfully, and then Denys, being over an~
hundred years of age, and his two comrades with him, suffered by the axe upon~
the 9th day of October. This is that Denys concerning whom the old story is told~
that after his head was cut off he took it in his hands and walked two thousand~
paces, carrying it all the while. He was the author of some marvellous books,~
clear proofs of a mind fixed in heaven, upon The Names of God, upon The Orders~
in Heaven and in the Church, upon The Mystic Theology, and divers others.

[Lectio94]
John Leonard born near the city of Lucca, showed himself from early youth grave~
and mature beyond his years. At twenty six he was called by God to enter the~
ranks of the clergy. He began by studying the rudiments of Latin with young boys,~
but made such progress in letters and in the disciplines of philosophy and~
theology, that scarcely four years later he was under obedience, promoted to~
priesthood. He founded the congregation of the Clerks Regular of the Mother of~
God, by whose work and zeal a great change of attitude was effected in the~
republic of Lucca. This aroused against John the bitter complaints of wicked men~
but he bore everything with serenity of mind, obtaining the confirmation of his~
congregation from Gregorv XIII. He was very sorrowful Svei the multitudes in~
distant parts who lacked the light of the Gospel and, having taken counsel with~
the devout leader Vives, he founded an institute of Priests whose work was to~
form young men who would be sent to propagate the faith in far countries~
Finally. having carried out his sacred ministry so perfectly, clad in sackcloth~
and ashes he went to the Lord at Rome on October 9 in the vear 1609, and was~
numbered among the Saints by pope Pius XI.
