Lesson from the book of Genesis
!Gen 4:17-22
17 And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and brought forth Henoch: and he built a city, and called the name thereof by the name of his son Henoch.
18 And Henoch begot Irad, and Irad begot Maviael, and Maviael begot Mathusael, and Mathusael begot Lamech:
19 Who took two wives: the name of the one was Ada, and the name of the other was Sella.
20 And Ada brought forth Jabel: who was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of herdsmen.
21 And his brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of them that play upon the harp and the organs.
22 Sella also brought forth Tubalcain, who was a hammerer and artificer in every work of brass and iron. And the sister of Tubalcain was Noema.

!Gen 4:23-26
23 And Lamech said to his wives Ada and Sell: Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech: for I have slain a man to the wounding of myself, and a stripling to my own bruising.
24 Sevenfold vengeance shall be taken for Cain: but for Lamech seventy times sevenfold.
25 Adam also knew his wife again: and she brought forth a son, and called his name Seth, saying: God hath given me another seed, for Abel whom Cain slew.
26 But to Seth also was born a son, whom he called Enos; this man began to call upon the name of the Lord.

!Gen 5:1-5
1 This is the book of the generation of Adam. In the day that God created man, he made him to the likeness of God.
2 He created them male and female; and blessed them: and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.
3 And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begot a son to his own image and likeness, and called his name Seth.
4 And the days of Adam, after he begot Seth, were eight hundred years: and he begot sons and daughters.
5 And all the time that Adam lived came to nine hundred and thirty years, and he died.
