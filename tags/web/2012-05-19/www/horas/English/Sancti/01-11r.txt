!Rom 15:1-4
1 NOW we that are stronger, ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not~
to please ourselves.
2 Let every one of you please his neighbour unto good, to edification.
3 For Christ did not please himself, but as it is written: The reproaches of~
them that reproached thee, fell upon me.
4 For what things soever were written, were written for our learning: that~
through patience and the comfort of the scriptures, we might have hope.

!Rom 15:5-11
5 Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be of one mind one towards~
another, according to Jesus Christ:
6 That with one mind, and with one mouth, you may glorify God and the Father of~
our Lord Jesus Christ.
7 Wherefore receive one another, as Christ also hath received you unto the~
honour of God.
8 For I say that Christ Jesus was minister of the circumcision for the truth of~
God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers.
9 But that the Gentiles are to glorify God for his mercy, as it is written:~
Therefore will I confess to thee, O Lord, among the Gentiles, and will sing to~
thy name.
10 And again he saith: Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.
11 And again: Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and magnify him, all ye people.

[Lectio3]
!Rom 15:12-16
12 And again Isaias saith: There shall be a root of Jesse; and he that shall~
rise up to rule the Gentiles, in him the Gentiles shall hope.
13 Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing; that you~
may abound in hope, and in the power of the Holy Ghost.
14 And I myself also, my brethren, am assured of you, that you also are full of~
love, replenished with all knowledge, so that you are able to admonish one~
another.
15 But I have written to you, brethren, more boldly in some sort, as it were~
putting you in mind: because of the grace which is given me from God.
16 That I should be the minister of Christ Jesus among the Gentiles; sanctifying~
the gospel of God, that the oblation of the Gentiles may be made acceptable and~
sanctified in the Holy Ghost.
