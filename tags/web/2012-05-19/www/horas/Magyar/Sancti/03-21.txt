means of his patronage

[Lectio4]
Benedict was born of a noble family at Norcia, (about the year of our Lord 480,)~
and studied letters at Rome. Desiring to give himself altogether to Christ Jesus,~
he betook himself to a very deep cave at the place now called Subiaco. In this~
place he lay hid for three years, unknown to all except the monk Romanus, by~
means of whom he received the necessaries of life. While he was in the cave at~
Subiaco, the devil one day assailed him with an extraordinary storm of impure~
temptation, and to get it under, he rolled himself in brambles till his whole~
body was lacerated, and the sting of pain drove out the sallies of lust. At last~
the fame of his holiness spread itself abroad from the desert, and some monks~
came to him for guidance, but the looseness of their lives was such that they~
could not bear his exhortations, and they plotted together to poison him in his~
drink. When they gave him the cup, he made the sign of the Cross over it,~
whereupon it immediately broke, and Benedict left that monastery, and retired to a~
desert place alone.

[Lectio5]
Neverthless his disciples followed him daily, and for them he built twelve~
monasteries, and set holy laws to govern them. Afterwards he went to Cassino,~
and brake the image of Apollo which was still worshipped there, overturned the~
altar, and burnt the groves. There, (in the year 529,) he built the Church of St~
Martin and the little chapel of St John; and instilled Christianity into the~
townspeople and inhabitants. He grew in the grace of God day by day, so that~
being endowed with the spirit of prophecy he foretold things to come. When~
Totila, King of the Goths, heard of it, and would see whether it really were so,~
he sent his spatharius before him, with the kingly ensigns and attendance, and~
feigning himself to be Totila. But as soon as Benedict saw him he said: My son,~
put off that which thou wearest, for it is not thine. To Totila himself he~
foretold that he would go to Rome, would cross the sea, and would die after nine~
years.

[Lectio6]
Come months before he departed this life, Benedict forewarned his disciples on~
what day he was to die; and he ordered his grave to be opened six days before he~
was carried to it. On the sixth day, (being the 21st of March, in the year 543,)~
he would be carried into the Church, where he received the Eucharist, and then,~
in the arms of his disciples, with his eyes lifted up to heaven, and wrapt in~
prayer, he gave up the ghost. Two monks saw his soul rising to heaven, clothed~
in a most precious garment, and surrounded with lights, and One of a most~
glorious and awful aspect standing above, Whom they heard saying This is the~
way whereby Benedict, the beloved of the Lord, goeth up to heaven.
