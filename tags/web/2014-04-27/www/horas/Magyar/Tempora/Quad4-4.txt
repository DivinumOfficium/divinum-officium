Evangélium szent Lukács könyvébõl
!Luke 7:11-16
Azon idõben Jézus Naim városába ment. Vele tartottak tanítványai és mások is~
igen sokan. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!Bk. v. Conwi. on Luke vii.
The history which we here read in the Holy Gospel hath for us specially two~
gracious lessons, the one from the literal, the other from the mystic~
interpretation thereof. According to the letter then, we see how quickly the~
compassion of God was aroused by the sorrow of this mother, who was a widow, a~
widow broken down by nursing her only son, or by the bitterness of her grief for~
his death. She was a widow also whose worshipful conversation is borne witness~
to by this, that, much people of the city was with her. Mystically however, this~
widow encompassed by the multitude was something more than a poor woman whose~
tears won from the Lord the resurrection of her young and only son; for she is a~
type of our holy Mother the Church, who calleth back her young children to life~
from the pursuit of deathly vanities, and soul-slaying honours, by bidding them~
look on those tears which she sheddeth for such as they, and which it is~
unlawful for her to shed for them of whom she knoweth that they will rise again.

This man, then, being dead, was carried out on a bier to the grave by four~
bearers, even as the sinner is borne to destruction by the four elements of~
which he is composed. But there was hope in his latter end, from this, that that~
whereon he was carried was of wood, and wood, albeit it had profited us little~
before, is become everything to us now since Jesus touched it, being a figure of~
that gibbet, the Cross, which was made thereof, and wherefrom salvation floweth~
unto all people. When, therefore, the horrid bearers of the corpse heard the~
commandment of God, they stood still, and carried no farther him who was dead~
through the fatal course of a material nature. And is not our case even as that~
of the widow's son, when we lie, as it were, lifeless, in our spiritual coffin,~
that is, in the last bed of our soul's death, consumed by the fever of unbridled~
lust, or frozen by cold-heartedness, or with our whole manliness sapped by some~
degrading habit of this earthly body, or starved by a spiritual lockjaw that~
shutteth our mouth to the bright food of our soul? These, and such as these, are~
they which carry us out to burial.

But even at the last hour, when the hope of life hath been utterly extinguished,~
and the bodies of the dead are lying by the side of the grave, by the word of~
God those carcases live again, yea, arise and speak. Then doth Jesus deliver the~
son to his mother, for Jesus calleth him out of the grave, and delivereth him~
from death. O, what is the grave of the soul but a bad life? Sinner! thy grave~
is unbelief, and thy throat is a sepulchre! Even so is it written Their throat~
is an open sepulchre, (Ps. v. ii,) whereout breathe their pestilential words.~
Lo! Christ maketh thee free from that grave! If only thou wilt hear the word of~
God, thou shalt yet arise from that sepulchre! Yea, though thy sin be exceeding~
weighty, so that the tears of thine own sorrow cannot wash it away, let thy~
Mother the Church weep for thee, that longing Mother who weepeth for every one~
of her children as though he were the only son of his mother, and she was a~
widow. Believe me, her spiritual anguish is keen like the anguish of nature,~
when she seeth her children dead in sin, and carried out to be buried for ever.

[Ant 2]
Jesus went into a city that is called Naim: and behold, a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother.

[Oratio 2]
O Almighty God, grant, we beseech thee, that we who are chastened by this~
hallowed fast, may be gladdened by holy earnestness, and that as earthly~
attractions grow dimmer, things heavenly may grow clearer.

[Ant 3]
A great Prophet * is risen up among us, and God hath visited His people.

[Oratio 3]
O God, the Teacher and Shepherd of all thy people, free the same from all sins~
which do assail them, that so they may ever be pleasing in thy sight and safe~
under thy shelter.
