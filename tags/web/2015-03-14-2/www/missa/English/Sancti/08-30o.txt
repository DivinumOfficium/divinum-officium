Lesson from the book of Wisdom
!Wis 10:17-20
v. And she rendered to the just the wages of their labours, and conducted them in a wonderful way: and she was to them for a covert by day, and for the light of stars by night: And she brought them through the Red Sea, and carried them over through a great water. But their enemies she drowned in the sea, and from the depth of hell she brought them out. Therefore the just took the spoils of the wicked. And they sung to thy holy name, O Lord, and they praised with one accord thy victorious hand.

[Graduale]
!Wis 3:1-2; 3:3
v. But the souls of the just are in the hand of God, and the torment of death~
shall not touch them.
V. In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die: and their departure was taken~
for misery: And their going away from us, for utter destruction: but they are in~
peace. Allelúja, allelúja.
V. The just shall shine, and shall run to and fro like sparks among the reeds~
forever. Allelúja.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 10:16-20
v. He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that despiseth you, despiseth me;~
and he that despiseth me, despiseth him that sent me. And the seventy-two~
returned with joy, saying: Lord, the devils also are subject to us in thy name.~
And he said to them: I saw Satan like lightening falling from heaven. Behold, I~
have given you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and upon all the~
power of the enemy: and nothing shall hurt you. But yet rejoice not in this,~
that spirits are subject unto you; but rejoice in this, that your names are~
written in heaven.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 31:11
v. Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye just, and glory, all ye right of heart.

[Secreta]
Look with favor, O Lord, on the offerings of Your people; may they find~
profitable for their salvation that rite which they devoutly perform in honor of~
Your Saints.

[Communio]
!Matt 10:27
v. That which I tell you in the dark, speak ye in the light: and that which you~
hear in the ear, preach ye upon the housetops.

[Postcommunio]
Filled by the holy sacrament, O Lord, we beseech You that, by the intercession~
of Your Saints, we may spend our lives in giving thanks to You.
