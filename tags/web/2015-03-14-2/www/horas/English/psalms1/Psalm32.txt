32:1 Rejoice in the Lord, O ye just: * praise becometh the upright.
32:2 Give praise to the Lord on the harp; * sing to him with the psaltery, the instrument of ten strings.
32:3 Sing to him a new canticle, * sing well unto him with a loud noise.
32:4 For the word of the Lord is right, * and all his works are done with faithfulness.
32:5 He loveth mercy and judgment; * the earth is full of the mercy of the Lord.
32:6 By the word of the Lord the heavens were established; * and all the power of them by the spirit of his mouth:
32:7 Gathering together the waters of the sea, as in a vessel; * laying up the depths in storehouses.
32:8 Let all the earth fear the Lord, * and let all the inhabitants of the world be in awe of him.
32:9 For he spoke and they were made: * he commanded and they were created.
32:10 The Lord bringeth to nought the counsels of nations; * and he rejecteth the devices of people, and casteth away the counsels of princes.
32:11 But the counsel of the Lord standeth for ever: * the thoughts of his heart to all generations.
32:12 Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord: * the people whom he hath chosen for his inheritance.
32:13 The Lord hath looked from heaven: * he hath beheld all the sons of men.
32:14 From his habitation which he hath prepared, * he hath looked upon all that dwell on the earth.
32:15 He who hath made the hearts of every one of them: * who understandeth all their works.
32:16 The king is not saved by a great army: * nor shall the giant be saved by his own great strength.
32:17 Vain is the horse for safety: * neither shall he be saved by the abundance of his strength.
32:18 Behold the eyes of the Lord are on them that fear him: * and on them that hope in his mercy.
32:19 To deliver their souls from death; * and feed them in famine.
32:20 Our soul waiteth for the Lord: * for he is our helper and protector.
32:21 For in him our heart shall rejoice: * and in his holy name we have trusted.
32:22 Let thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us, * as we have hoped in thee.
