v. Come Holy Ghost, who ever One
Art with the Father and the Son,
It is the hour, our souls possess
With thy full flood of holiness.
_
Let flesh and heart and lips and mind
Sound forth our witness to mankind;
And love light up our mortal frame,
Till others catch the living flame.
_
* Almighty Father, hear our cry,
Through Jesus Christ, our Lord most High,
Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,
Doth live and reign eternally.
Amen.
