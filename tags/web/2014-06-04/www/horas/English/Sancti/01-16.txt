[Oratio]
O Lord, we pray thee, mercifully give ear unto the prayers of thy people who~
rejoice at the memory of the victory through suffering of thy blessed Martyr and~
Bishop Marcellus, and for his sake succour us.
$Per Dominum

[Lectio4]
This Marcellus was a Roman, and held the supreme Pontificate from (the year of~
our Lord 304, in) the reign of Constantius and Galerius, till (310, in) that~
of Maxentius. It was through his persuasion that the Roman lady Lucina left the~
whole of her property to the Church of God. As the believers increased, he~
instituted new titles in the City, which he divided after the manner of dioceses~
for their convenience, and for the baptism and penance of heathens converted to~
Christianity, and for the burial of the martyrs. These proceedings excited the~
wrath of Maxentius, who threatened Marcellus with the heaviest punishment,~
unless he would lay down the Popedom and sacrifice to idols.

[Lectio5]
The servant of God treated with contempt the mad cries of this man, who~
accordingly took him and sent him to a menagerie, to take care of the beasts~
which were fed at the public cost. Marcellus remained at this place for nine~
months, which he spent in continual fasting and prayer, and, as he could not~
visit the parishes in person, he wrote letters to them. Some clerks rescued him,~
and the blessed Lucina hospitably received him into her house, in which he~
dedicated a Church, which is now called St Marcellus'. Here the Christians met~
to pray, and the blessed Marcellus himself preached.

[Lectio6]
These proceedings came to the knowledge of Maxentius, who thereupon had the wild~
beasts brought from the menagerie and located in the church, where Marcellus was~
made to feed them. The noisomeness of the place and the filthiness of his~
occupation broke down a constitution already enfeebled by many ailments, and he~
fell asleep in the Lord. The blessed Lucina buried his body in the cemetery of~
Priscilla, on the Salarian Way, on the 16th of January. He sat on the throne of~
Peter for five years, one month, and twenty-five days. He wrote an epistle to~
the Bishops of the Patriarchate of Antioch on the primacy of the Roman Church,~
wherein he proveth the right of the same Church to be called the head of all the~
Churches. In this letter he likewise saith that no Council can be lawfully~
gathered together except by the authority of the Roman Pontiff. He ordained at~
Rome in the month of December twenty - five Priests, two Deacons, and twenty -~
one Bishops for divers Sees.

R. O Lord, thou hast prevented him with blessings of sweetness: 
* Thou hast set on his head a crown of precious stones.
V. He asked life of thee: * and thou hast given him length of days for ever and ever. 
R. Thou hast set on his head a crown of precious stones.
&Gloria
R. Thou hast set on his head a crown of precious stones.

[Lectio94]
Marcellus of Rome was Pope from the reign of Constantius and Galerius to that of~
Maxentius. At his suggestion the Roman lady Lucina willed her property to God's~
Church. Because the number of the faithful in the city had increased, he set up~
new parishes and divided the City into various districts. This angered Maxentius~
and he threatened Marcellus with heavy punishments unless he would abandon his~
pontificate and sacrifice to idols. The Pope resisted steadfastly, and so~
Maxentius had him sent to the stable to take care of the beasts fed at the~
public expense. Marcellus spent nine months there, and since he could not be~
present in his parishes in person, he visited them by his letters. He was~
rescued from this place by some clerics and given hospitality by Lucina in whose~
house he dedicated a church where he preached to the faithful. Then Maxentius ordered~
the beasts moved from the stable to the church, so that Marcellus again had to~
take care of them. The foul atmosphere of the place and his hardships soon proved~
fatal to Marcellus. He died in the Lord, and was buried in the cemetery of~
Priscilla on the Salarian Way by blessed Lucina, on January 16.
