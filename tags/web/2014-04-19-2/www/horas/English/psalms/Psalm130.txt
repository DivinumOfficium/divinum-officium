130:1 (A gradual canticle of David.) Lord, my heart is not exalted: nor are my eyes lofty. Neither have I walked in great matters, nor in wonderful things above me.
130:2 If I was not humbly minded, but exalted my soul: As a child that is weaned is towards his mother, so reward in my soul.
130:3 Let Israel hope in the Lord, from henceforth now and for ever.
