Olvasmány szent Pál apostol Rómaiakhoz irott levelébõl
!Rom 7:1-3
1 Nem tudjátok, testvérek - a törvény ismerõihez szólok -, hogy a törvénynek csak addig van hatalma az emberen, amíg él? 
2 A férjes asszonyt például törvény köti életben levõ férjéhez, a férj halálával azonban felszabadul a férj törvénye alól. 
3 Ha férje életében más férfié lett, házasságtörõnek mondják. A férj halála után azonban felszabadul a törvény alól, és nem válik házasságtörõvé, ha más férfié lesz. 

[Lectio2]
!Rom 7:4-6
4 Éppígy, testvérek, Krisztus testében ti is meghaltatok a törvénynek, hogy ahhoz tartozzatok, aki feltámadt a halálból. Ezért most teremjünk gyümölcsöt Istennek. 
5 Amíg ugyanis testi emberként éltünk, a törvény fölébresztette bûnös szenvedélyek mûködtek tagjaikban, hogy a halálnak teremjünk gyümölcsöt. 
6 Most azonban felszabadultunk a törvény alól, mert meghaltunk annak, ami fogva tartott, s ezért új lélekkel szolgálunk, nem az elavult betû szerint. 

[Lectio3]
!Rom 7:7-9
7 Mit mondjunk tehát? Talán a törvény bûn? Semmi esetre sem. De a bûnt a törvény alapján ismertem meg, hiszen a bûnös kívánság nem vált volna bennem tudottá, ha a törvény nem mondaná: Ne kívánd meg! 
8 A tilalom tehát alkalmat nyújtott a bûnnek arra, hogy fölébresszen bennem mindenféle kívánságot. Törvény nélkül ugyanis a bûn halott volna. 
9 Valamikor törvény nélkül éltem, de azután jött a parancs, a bûn föléledt, én pedig meghaltam.

From the Sermons of St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!1st for Childermas.
The Lord is born, and sorrow breaketh out, not in heaven but on earth; to~
mothers is proclaimed lamentation, to angels joy, to children translation. God~
is born, and innocence must be offered up to Him Who cometh to condemn the~
malice of the world. The Lamb that taketh away the sins of the world is come to~
be crucified, and the tender flock is brought to the sacrifice. But the mothers~
will lament over them whose inarticulate bleating is silenced for ever. Let us~
turn a look on this great martyrdom, this heart-rending sorrow. The sword is~
drawn, though there is no offence to punish, only jealousy shrieking for Him Who~
is born, and doth no violence. And here are mothers weeping over the lambs of~
the flock. In Ramah was there a voice heard, weeping and great mourning. (which~
shall be returned hereafter), but they are pledges taken without being given,~
impounded without being entrusted.

Nature is herself our witness of what the scene must have been when the tyrant~
dashed the little ones against the stones. The childless mothers tore their hair;~
those, whose infants had still escaped, strove vainly to hide them, and their~
very cries betrayed them, too young to have learnt the silence of fear.~
Sometimes the wretched mother struggled with the executioner, as he dragged the~
child to which she clung from her arms. The fruit of her body is torn from her~
breast. Was it for this that her womb bore it, and her paps gave it suck? Had~
she carried it so tenderly, that the murderer might seize it? It had come of her~
body only to be dashed against the stones.

[Lectio6]
Sometimes a broken-hearted woman cried to the ruffian to kill her also;~
wherefore leave her to her childless widowhood? If fault there were, the fault~
was hers, then why not let her suffer and follow her lost one? Some must have~
cried out that all were being slain for the sake of One, and that One had~
escaped. And surely some called for the coming of the Messiah to deliver them.~
Come, come, O Saviour, how long do we wait for thee? Thou art Almighty come,~
and save our children. And so the cry of the mother and the sacrifice of her~
offspring went up together to heaven.

Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kõnyvébõl
!Matt 2:13-18
Azon idõben megjelent Józsefnek álmában az Úr angyala, s ezt mondta neki: "Kelj föl, fogd a gyermeket és anyját, menekülj Egyiptomba, s maradj ott, amíg nem szólok És így tovább.
_
Homily by St John Chrysostom, Patriarch (of Constantinople.)
!8th on Matthew.
When Joseph had heard this he was not troubled, neither did he say, This is~
doubtful, or at least obscure. Thou saidst not long ago, that He shall save His~
people, and now apparently Himself He cannot save; but we are to flee, and~
journey far, and dwell in a strange land. thy works belie thy words. But Joseph~
said none of these things, for he was faithful; neither did he curiously ask of~
the angel the time of his return, which God was not pleased to show him, but~
only to send him that word, Be thou there until I bring thee word.

[Lectio8]
He was not slothful, but obeyed cheerfully, and by faith bore all tribulations~
with joy. God in His mercy mingled some joy with his sorrow, as He doth in all~
the saints, whom He will have to abide continually neither in sorrow, nor in joy~
but weaveth their life ever with a strange diversity. And let us consider how He~
did it here.

[Lectio9]
When St Joseph knew that the Virgin was with child, he was greatly troubled; but~
forthwith an Angel came to take away his fears. The Lord was born and he~
rejoiced with exceeding joy; but straightway came the great danger, when all~
Jerusalem was troubled, the king in great wrath, and murderers seeking the young~
Child's life. The star shone over Bethlehem, and the wise men came to worship;~
but Herod sought to slay the Saviour; and they arose, and fled into a far~
country.
