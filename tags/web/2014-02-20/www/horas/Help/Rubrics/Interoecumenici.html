  <P><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial"><A NAME="anchor36365784"></A><B>Introduction</B></font></P>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial"><B>I. NATURE OF THIS INSTRUCTION</B></font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">1. Among the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council's primary achievements must be counted the Constitution on the Liturgy, since it regulates the most exalted sphere of the Church's activity. The document will have ever richer effects as pastors and faithful alike deepen their understanding of its genuine spirit and with good will put it into practice.</font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">2. The <I>Consilium</I>, which Pope Paul VI established by the
  <I>Motu Proprio <A HREF="SacramLiturgiam.html">Sacram Liturgiam</A>,</I>
  has promptly taken up its two appointed tasks: to carry out the
  directives of the Constitution and of <I>Sacram Liturgiam</I> and to provide the means for interpreting these documents and putting them into practice.</font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">3. That these documents should immediately be properly carried out everywhere and any possible doubts on interpretation removed are matters of the utmost importance. Therefore, by papal mandate, the <I>Consilium</I> has prepared the present Instruction. It
  sets out more sharply the functions of conferences of bishops
  in liturgical matters, explains more fully those principles stated
  in general terms in the aforementioned documents, and authorizes
  or mandates that those measures that are practicable before revision
  of the liturgical books go into effect immediately.</font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial"><B>II. PRINCIPLES TO BE KEPT IN MIND</B></font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">4. The reason for deciding to put these things into practice
  now is that the liturgy may ever more fully satisfy the conciliar
  intent on promoting active participation of the faithful. R1</font></p>
			<P><FONT size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">The faithful will more readily respond to the overall reform of the liturgy if this proceeds step by step in stages and if pastors present and explain it to them by means of the needed catechesis.</FONT></P>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">5. Necessary before all else, however, is the shared conviction that the <A HREF="SacrosanctumConcilium.html">Constitution on
  the Liturgy</A> has as its objective not simply to change liturgical forms and texts but rather to bring to life the kind of formation of the faithful and ministry of pastors that will have their summit and source in the liturgy (see SC art. 10). That is the purpose of the changes made up to now and of those yet to come.</font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">6. Pastoral activity guided toward the liturgy has its power in being a living experience of the paschal mystery, in which the Son of God, incarnate and made obedient even to the death of the cross, has in his resurrection and ascension been raised up in such a way that he communicates his divine life to the world. Through this life those who are dead to sin and conformed to Christ &quot;may live no longer for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised&quot; (2 Cor 5:15).</font></p>
			<P><FONT size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">Faith and the sacraments of faith
  accomplish this, especially baptism (see SC art. 6) and the mystery
  of the eucharist (see SC art. 47), the center of the other sacraments
  and sacramentals (see SC art. 61), and of the cycle of celebrations
  that in the course of the year unfold Christ's paschal mystery
  (see SC art. 102-107).</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">7. The liturgy, it is true, does
  not exhaust the entire activity of the Church (see SC art. 9);
  nevertheless the greatest care must be taken about rightly linking
  pastoral activity with the liturgy and carrying out a pastoral
  liturgy not as if it were set apart and existing in isolation
  but as it is closely joined to other pastoral works.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">Especially necessary is a close,
  living union between liturgy, catechesis, religious formation,
  and preaching.</FONT></P>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial"><B>III. RESULTS TO BE HOPED FOR</B></font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">8. Bishops and their assistants in the priesthood should, therefore,
  attach ever greater importance to their whole pastoral ministry
  as it is focused toward the liturgy. Then the faithful themselves
  will richly partake of the divine life through sharing in the
  sacred celebrations and, changed into the leaven of Christ and
  the salt of the earth, will proclaim that divine life and pass
  it on to others.</font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial"><A NAME="anchor36364286"></A><B>Chapter I. General Norms</B><BR>
					<B>I. HOW THE NORMS APPLY</B></font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">9. The practical norms, in the Constitution and in this Instruction, as well as practices this Instruction allows or mandates even before revision of the liturgical books, even if they are part of the Roman Rite, may be applied in other Latin rites, due regard being given to the provisions of law.</font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">10. Matters that this Instruction commits to the power of the competent, territorial ecclesiastical authority can and should be put into effect only by such authority through lawful decrees.</font></p>
			<P><FONT size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">In every case the time and circumstances in which such decrees begin to take effect are to be stipulated, with a reasonable preceding interval (<i>vacatio</i>) provided for instruction and preparation of the faithful regarding their observance.</FONT></P>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial"><B>II. THE LITURGICAL FORMATION OF CLERICS</B> (SC art. 15-16 and 18)</font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">11. Regarding the liturgical formation of the clergy:</font></p>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">a. In theological faculties there shall be a chair of liturgy so that all students may receive the requisite liturgical instruction; in seminaries and religious houses of studies local Ordinaries and major superiors shall see to it that as soon as possible there is a properly trained specialist in liturgy.</FONT></P>
				<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">b. Professors appointed to teach liturgy shall be trained as soon as possible, in keeping with the norms of the Constitution art. 15.</font></p>
				<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">c. For the continuing liturgical education of clerics, especially those already working in the Lord's vineyard, institutes in pastoral liturgy shall be set up wherever possible.</font></p>
			</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">12. The course in liturgy shall be of appropriate duration, to be fixed in the curriculum of studies by competent authority, and shall follow a method patterned on the norm of the Constitution art. 16.</FONT></P>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">13. Liturgical celebrations shall be carried out as perfectly as possible. Therefore:</font></p>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">
    a. Rubrics shall be observed exactly and ceremonies carried out
    with dignity, under the careful supervision of superiors and
    with the required preparation beforehand.<BR>
    b. Clerics shall frequently exercise the liturgical functions
    proper to their order, i.e., of deacon, subdeacon, acolyte, reader,
    as well as those of commentator and cantor.<BR>
    c. Churches and chapels, all sacred furnishings and vestments
    shall bear the mark of genuine Christian art, including the contemporary.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial"><B>III. LITURGICAL FORMATION OF THE CLERIC'S SPIRITUAL LIFE </B>(SC art. 17)</FONT></P>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">14. In order that clerics may be trained for a full participation in liturgical celebrations and for a spiritual life deriving from them and to be shared later with others, the Constitution on the Liturgy shall be put into full effect in seminaries and religious houses of studies in keeping with the norms of the documents of the Holy See, the superiors and faculty all working together in harmony to achieve this goal. In order to guide clerics properly toward the liturgy: books are to be recommended on liturgy, especially in its theological and spiritual dimensions, and made available in the library in sufficient numbers; there are to be meditations and conferences, drawn above all from the fonts of sacred Scripture and liturgy (see Const. art. 35, 2); and those communal devotions are to be observed that are in keeping with Christian customs and practice and are suited to the various seasons of the liturgical year.</font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">15. The eucharist, center of the whole spiritual life, is to be celebrated daily and with the use of different forms of celebration best suited to the condition of the participants.</font></p>
			<P><FONT size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">On Sundays and on the other greater
  holydays a sung Mass shall be celebrated, with all who live in
  the house participating; there is to be a homily and, as far
  as possible, all who are not priests shall receive communion.
  Once the new rite has been published, concelebration is permitted
  for priests, especially on more solemn feasts, if pastoral needs
  do not require individual celebration. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">At least on the great festivals it would be well for seminarians to participate in the eucharist gathered round the bishop in the cathedral church.</FONT></P>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">16. Even if not yet bound by obligation to divine office, clerics should each day recite or sing in common lauds in the morning as morning prayer and vespers in the evening as evening prayer or compline at the end of the day. Superiors should, as far as possible, themselves take part in this common recitation. Sufficient time shall be provided in the daily schedule for clerics in sacred orders to pray the divine office.</font></p>
			<P><FONT size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">At least on major festivals it would be well, when possible, for seminarians to sing evening prayer in the cathedral church.</FONT></P>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">17. Religious devotions, arranged according to the laws or customs of each place or institute, shall be held in due esteem. Nevertheless, care should be taken that, especially if they are held in common, they harmonize with the liturgy, in keeping with the Constitution art. 13, and that they take into account the seasons of the liturgical year.</font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial"><B>IV. LITURGICAL FORMATION OF MEMBERS OF RELIGIOUS INSTITUTES</B></font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">18. The foregoing articles on the liturgical formation of clerics'
  spiritual life are to be applied, with the required modifications,
  to both men and women members of religious institutes.</font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial"><B> V. LITURGICAL FORMATION OF THE FAITHFUL</B> (SC art. 19)</font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">19. Pastors shall strive diligently and patiently to carry out the mandate of the Constitution on the liturgical formation of the faithful and on their active participation, both inward and outward, &quot;in keeping with their age and condition, their way of life, and stage of religious development&quot; (SC art. 19). They should be especially concerned about the liturgical formation and active participation of those involved in lay religious associations; such people have the responsibility of sharing more fully in the Church's life and of assisting their pastors in the effective promotion of parish liturgical life (see SC art. 42).</font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial"><B>VI. COMPETENT AUTHORITY IN LITURGICAL MATTERS </B>(SC art. 22)</font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">20. Regulation of the liturgy belongs to the authority of the Church; no one, therefore, is to act on individual initiative in this matter, thereby, as might well happen, doing harm to the liturgy and to its reform under competent authority. </font></p>
			<P><FONT size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">21. The Holy See has the authority
  to reform and approve the general liturgical books; to regulate
  the liturgy in matters affecting the universal Church; to approve
  or confirm the <I>acta</I> and decisions of territorial authorities;
  and to accede to their proposals and requests.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">22. The bishop has the authority
  to regulate the liturgy within his own diocese, in keeping with
  the norms and spirit of the Constitution on the Liturgy, the
  decrees of the Holy See, and competent territorial authority.
  </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">23. The various territorial assemblies
  of bishops that have responsibility for the liturgy by virtue
  of the Constitution art. 22 should for the time being be taken
  to mean one of the following:</FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">a. an assembly of all the bishops
    of a nation, in accordance with the norm of the <I>Motu Proprio
    Sacram Liturgiam X</I>;<BR>
						b. an assembly already lawfully constituted and consisting of the bishops -- or of the bishops and other local Ordinaries -- of several nations;<BR>
						c. an assembly yet to be constituted, with the permission of the Holy See, and consisting of the bishops -- or of the bishops and local Ordinaries -- of several nations, especially if the bishops in the individual nations are so few that it would be more advantageous for a group to be formed of those from various nations sharing the same language and culture.<BR>
					</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">If particular local conditions suggest another course, the matter should be referred to the Holy See.</FONT></P>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">24. The following must be included in the call to any of the above-mentioned assemblies:</font></p>

    a. residential bishops;<BR>

  assembly.</FONT></P>

  lawful provision for certain places and in view of special circumstances,
  the assembly must be convened:</FONT></p>

    a. by the one who is the president, in the case of assemblies

    b. in other cases, by the archbishop or bishop having right of
    precedence under the norm of law.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
			<P><FONT size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">26. The president, with the consent of the fathers, establishes
  the rules of order for dealing with issues and opens, transfers,
  extends, and adjourns the sessions of the assembly.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">27. A deliberative vote belongs
  to all those named in no. 24, including coadjutor and auxiliary
  bishops, unless the convening instrument expressly provides otherwise.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">28. Lawful enactment of decrees
  requires a two-thirds vote by secret ballot.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">29. The acta of the competent territorial authority, to be transmitted to the Holy See for approval, that is, confirmation, should include the following:</FONT></P>

			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">32. Parts belonging to the choir or to the people and sung or recited by them are not said privately by the celebrant.</font></p>
			<P><FONT size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">33. Nor are readings that are
  read or sung by the appropriate minister said privately by the

			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">34. Individual bishops, or, if it seems advisable, regional or national conferences of bishops shall see to it that the Council's prohibition against preferential treatment of individuals or a social class either in the ceremonies or by outward display is respected in their territories.</font></p>
			<P><FONT size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">35. In addition, pastors shall
  not neglect to ensure prudently and charitably that in the liturgical
  services and more especially in the celebration of Mass and the
  administration of the sacraments and sacramentals the equality
  of the faithful is clearly apparent and that any suggestion of
  moneymaking is avoided.</FONT></P>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial"><B>IX. SIMPLIFICATION OF CERTAIN RITES</B> (SC art. 34)</font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">36. In order that liturgical services may manifest a noble simplicity more attuned to the spirit of the times:</font></p>

    a. the celebrant and ministers shall bow to the choir only at

    c. incensation shall be limited to the one altar where the liturgical
    rite is being celebrated;<BR>
    d. kissing of the hand and of objects presented or received shall

  <P><FONT size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial"><B>X. CELEBRATIONS OF THE WORD OF GOD</B> (SC art. .35, &sect; 4)</FONT></P>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">37. In places without a priest and where none is available for celebration of Mass on Sundays and holydays of obligation, a sacred celebration of the word of God with a deacon or even a properly appointed layperson presiding, shall be arranged, at the discretion of the local Ordinary.</font></p>
			<P><FONT size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">The plan of such a celebration
  shall be almost the same as that of the liturgy of the word at
  Mass. Normally the epistle and gospel from the Mass of the day
  shall be read in the vernacular, with chants, especially from
  the psalms, before and between the readings. If the one presiding
  is a deacon, he shall give a homily; a nondeacon shall read a
  homily chosen by the bishop or the pastor. The whole celebration
  is to end with the universal prayer or prayer of the faithful
  and the Lord's Prayer. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">38. Celebrations of the word
  of God, to be promoted on the vigils of more solemn feast days,
  should also follow the structure of the liturgy of the word at
  Mass, although it is quite permissible to have but one reading.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">Where there are several readings,
  their arrangement, for a clear perception of the progression
  of salvation history, should place the Old Testament reading
  before the one from the New Testament and should show the reading
  of the gospel to be the culmination of all.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">39. The diocesan liturgical commissions
  shall be responsible for suggesting and making available such
  resources as will ensure dignity and devotion in these celebrations
  of the word.</FONT></P>

			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">40. Vernacular translations of liturgical texts to be prepared in conformity with the norms of art. 36, &sect; 3 will benefit from observing the following criteria.</font></p>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">a. The basis of the translations is the Latin liturgical text. The version of the biblical passages should conform to the same Latin liturgical text. This does not, however, take away the right to revise that version, should it seem advisable, on the basis of the original text or of some clearer version.</FONT></P>
				<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">b. The liturgical commission mentioned in the Constitution art. 44 and in the present Instruction art. 44 is to have special responsibility for the preparation of translations of liturgical texts, with the institute of pastoral liturgy providing as much assistance as possible. But where there is no such commission, two or three bishops are to share responsibility for the translating; they are to choose experts, including the laity, in Scripture, liturgy, the biblical languages, Latin, the vernacular, and music. Sound translation of a liturgical text into the language of a people has to answer many requirements simultaneously.</font></p>
				<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">c. Where applicable, there should be consultation on translations with bishops of neighboring regions using the same language.</font></p>
				<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">d. In nations of several languages there should be a translation for each language, to be submitted to the bishops involved for careful examination.</font></p>
				<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">e. Special attention should be given to the high quality of books used for reading the liturgical text to the people in the vernacular, so that even the book's appearance may prompt greater reverence for the word of God and for sacred objects.</font></p>
			</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">
  41. Liturgical services held anywhere for people of a foreign
  language, especially for immigrants, members of a personal parish,
  or other like groups, may, with the consent of the local Ordinary,
  lawfully be celebrated in the native tongue of these faithful.
  Such celebrations are to conform to the limits for use of the
  vernacular and to the translation approved by the competent,
  territorial ecclesiastical authority for the language in question.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">42. Melodies for parts to be

  or in part.</FONT></P>

The liturgical commission, which should be expeditiously established by the territorial authority, shall as far as possible be chosen from among the bishops themselves or at least include one of them, along with priests expert in liturgical and pastoral matters and designated by name for this office.</font></p>

After singing or reading the epistle, the subdeacon goes to the celebrant for the blessing. At this point the celebrant, remaining seated, puts incense into the thurible and blesses it. During the singing of the Alleluia and verse or toward the end of other chants after the epistle, the celebrant rises to bless the deacon. From his place he listens to the gospel, kisses the Book of the Gospels, and, after the homily, intones the Credo, when prescribed. At the end of the Credo he returns to the altar with the ministers, unless he is to lead the prayer of the faithful.</font></p>

In sung or recited Masses in which the celebrant sings or recites the gospel, during the singing or saying of the Alleluia and verse or toward the end of other chants after the epistle, he goes to the foot of the altar and there, bowing profoundly, says the <i>Munda cor meum</i>. He then goes to the lectern or to the edge of the sanctuary to sing or recite the gospel.</font></p>

			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">55.

If the Mass is celebrated by someone else, the bishop should assist at the Mass in the vestments prescribed for the conferral of confirmation; they may be either of the color of the Mass or white.

If, however, the apostolic blessing with plenary indulgence at the hour of death is also to be imparted, it shall be given immediately before the anointing; the sprinkling with its formularies, the Confiteor, and absolution are omitted.</font></p>

After the reading of the epistle and gospel from the <i>Missa pro sponsis,</i> there shall be a sermon or homily based on the sacred text (see SC art. 52).

(For parts of the office shared with the Roman Rite, however, they are to use the version approved by competent territorial authority.) The Ordinaries are then to submit the translation for the Holy See's confirmation.</font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">89. Breviaries for clerics who, according to the provisions of art. 101, &sect; 2, have the right to use the vernacular for the divine office should contain the Latin text along with the vernacular.</font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial"><a name="anchor36495058"></a><b><a href="#anchor36495058">Chapter V. Designing Churches and Altars to Facilitate Active Participation of the Faithful</a></b></font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial"><b>I. DESIGN OF CHURCHES</b></font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">	90. In building new churches or restoring and adapting old ones every care is to be taken that they are suited to celebrating liturgical services authentically and that they ensure active participation by the faithful (see SC art. 124).</font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial"><b>II. MAIN ALTAR</b></font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">91. The main altar should preferably be freestanding, to permit walking around it and celebration facing the people. Its location in the place of worship should be truly central so that the attention of the whole congregation naturally focuses there.</font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">Choice of materials for the construction and adornment of the altar is to respect the prescriptions of law.</font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">The sanctuary area is to be spacious enough to accommodate the sacred rites.</font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial"><b>III. CHAIR FOR CELEBRANT AND MINISTERS</b></font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">92. In relation to the plan of the church, the chair for the celebrant and ministers should occupy a place that is clearly visible to all the faithful and that makes it plain that the celebrant presides over the whole community.</font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">Should the chair stand behind the altar, any semblance of a throne, the prerogative of a bishop, is to be avoided.</font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial"><b>IV. MINOR ALTARS</b></font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">	93. There are to be fewer minor altars and, where the design of the building permits, the best place for them is in chapels somewhat set apart from the body of the church.</font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial"><b>V. ALTAR APPOINTMENTS</b></font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">	94. At the discretion of the Ordinary, the cross and candlesticks required on the altar for the various liturgical rites may also be placed next to it.</font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial"><b>VI. RESERVATION OF THE EUCHARIST</b></font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">	95. The eucharist is to be reserved in a solid and secure tabernacle, placed in the middle of the main altar or on a minor, but truly worthy altar, or, in accord with lawful custom and in particular cases approved by the local Ordinary, also in another, special, and properly adorned part of the church. </font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">It is lawful to celebrate Mass facing the people even on an altar where there is a small but becoming tabernacle.</font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial"><b>VII. LECTERN <i>(AMBO)</i></b></font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">	96. There should be a lectern or lecterns for the proclamation of the readings, so arranged that the faithful may readily see and hear the minister.</font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial"><b>VIII. PLACE FOR CHOIR AND ORGAN</b></font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">	97. The choir and organ shall occupy a place clearly showing that the singers and the organist form part of the united community of the faithful and allowing them best to fulfill their part in the liturgy.</font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial"><b>IX. PLACE FOR THE FAITHFUL</b></font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">	98. Special care should be taken that the place for the faithful will assure their proper participation in the sacred rites with both eyes and mind. Normally there should be benches or chairs for their use but, in keeping with the Constitution art. 32, the custom of reserving places for special persons is to be suppressed.</font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">Care is also to be taken to enable the faithful not only to see the celebrant and other ministers but also to hear them easily, even by use of modern sound equipment.</font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial"><b>X. BAPTISTRY</b></font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">	99. In the construction and decoration of the baptistry great pains are to be taken to ensure that it clearly expresses the dignity of the sacrament of baptism and that it is a place well suited to communal celebrations (see SC art. 27).</font></p>
			<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, Arial">This Instruction was prepared by the <i>Consilium</i> by mandate of Pope Paul VI, and presented to the Pope by Cardinal Giacomo Lercaro, President of the <i>Consilium</i>. After having carefully considered the Instruction, in consultation with the <i>Consilium</i> and the Congregation of Rites, Pope Paul in an audience granted to Cardinal Arcadio Maria Larraona, Prefect of the Congregation of Rites, gave it specific approval as a whole and in its parts, confirmed it by his authority, and ordered it to be published and faithfully observed by all concerned, beginning on the first Sunday of Lent, March 7, 1965.</font></p>
