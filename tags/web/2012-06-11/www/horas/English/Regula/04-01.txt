04-01# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 50: Concerning Brethren Who Are Working At a Distance From the Oratory, Or Are On the Road
_
Let brethren who are at work quite a long way off or are on the road and cannot get to the oratory at the appointed time, the abbot having decided that such is the case, say their office there where they are at work, kneeling with all reverence. Similarly let not those who have been sent on a journey neglect an appointed hour but keep it, by themselves, and not fail to render the full measure of their holy servitude as they are able.
