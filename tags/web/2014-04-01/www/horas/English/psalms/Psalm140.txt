140:1 I have cried to thee, O Lord, hear me: hearken to my voice, when I cry to thee.
140:2 Let my prayer be directed as incense in thy sight; the lifting up of my hands, as evening sacrifice.
140:3 Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth: and a door round about my lips.
140:4 Incline not my heart to evil words; to make excuses in sins. With men that work iniquity: and I will not communicate with the choicest of them.
140:5 The just man shall correct me in mercy, and shall reprove me: but let not the oil of the sinner fatten my head. For my prayer shall still be against the things with which they are well pleased:
140:6 Their judges falling upon the rock have been swallowed up. They shall hear my words, for they have prevailed:
140:7 As when the thickness of the earth is broken up upon the ground: Our bones are scattered by the side of hell.
140:8 But to thee, O Lord, Lord, are my eyes: in thee have I put my trust, take not away my soul.
140:9 Keep me from the snare, which they have laid for me, and from the stumblingblocks of them that work iniquity.
140:10 The wicked shall fall in his net: I am alone until I pass.
