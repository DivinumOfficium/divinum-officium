04-09# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 56: Concerning the Abbot’s Table
_
Let the abbot’s table always be with the guests and strangers. Let it however be within his rights, as often as there are but few guests, to invite whom he will from among the brethren: yet for discipline’s sake let him always arrange for one or two of the seniors to be sent away from his table to be with the brethren.
