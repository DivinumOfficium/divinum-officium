(Canticum Tobiae * Tob 13:10-17)
13:10 Bless ye the Lord, all his elect, keep days of joy, and give glory to him.
13:11 Jerusalem, city of God, the Lord hath chastised thee for the works of thy hands.
13:12 Give glory to the Lord for thy good things, and bless the God eternal, that he may rebuild his tabernacle in thee, and may call back all the captives to thee, and thou mayst rejoice for ever and ever.
13:13 Thou shalt shine with a glorious light: and all the ends of the earth shall worship thee.
13:14 Nations from afar shall come to thee: and shall bring gifts, and shall adore the Lord in thee, and shall esteem thy land as holy.
13:15 For they shall call upon the great name in thee.
13:16 They shall be cursed that shall despise thee: and they shall be condemned that shall blaspheme thee: and blessed shall they be that shall build thee up.
13:17 But thou shalt rejoice in thy children, because they shall all be blessed, and shall be gathered together to the Lord.
