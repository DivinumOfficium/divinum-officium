56:1 Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me: * for my soul trusteth in thee.
56:2 And in the shadow of thy wings will I hope, * until iniquity pass away. 
56:3 I will cry to God the most High; * to God who hath done good to me. 
56:4 He hath sent from heaven and delivered me: * he hath made them a reproach that trod upon me.
56:5 God hath sent his mercy and his truth, * and he hath delivered my soul from the midst of the young lions. I slept troubled.
56:6 The sons of men, whose teeth are weapons and arrows, * and their tongue a sharp sword.
56:7 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, * and thy glory above all the earth.
56:8 They prepared a snare for my feet; * and they bowed down my soul.
56:9 They dug a pit before my face, * and they are fallen into it.
56:10 My heart is ready, O God, my heart is ready: * I will sing, and rehearse a psalm.
56:11 Arise, O my glory, arise psaltery and harp: * I will arise early.
56:12 I will give praise to thee, O Lord, among the people: * I will sing a psalm to thee among the nations.
56:13 For thy mercy is magnified even to the heavens: * and thy truth unto the clouds.
56:14 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: * and thy glory above all the earth.
