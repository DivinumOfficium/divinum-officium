[Lectio]
Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Galatians
!Gal 4:1-7
v. Now I say, as long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed by the father: So we also, when we were children, were serving under the elements of the world. But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent his Son, made of a woman, made under the law: That he might redeem them who were under the law: that we might receive the adoption of sons. And because you are sons, God hath sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying: Abba, Father. Therefore now he is not a servant, but a son. And if a son, an heir also through God.

[Graduale]
!Ps 44:3; 44:2
v. Thou art beautiful above the sons of men: grace is poured abroad in thy lips; therefore hath God blessed thee for ever My heart hath uttered a good word I speak my works to the king; My tongue is the pen of a scrivener that writeth swiftly. Allelúja, allelúja
!Ps 92:l
The Lord hath reigned, he is clothed with beauty: the Lord is clothed with strength. Allelúja.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 2:19-23.
v. But when Herod was dead, behold an angel of the Lord appeared in sleep to Joseph in Egypt, Saying: Arise, and take the child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel. For they are dead that sought the life of the child. Who arose, and took the child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. But hearing that Archelaus reigned in Judea in the room of Herod his father, he was afraid to go thither: and being warned in sleep retired into the quarters of Galilee. And coming he dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was said by prophets: That he shall be called a Nazarene.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 92:1-2
v. The Lord hath girded himself. For he hath established the world which shall not be moved. Thy throne is prepared from of old: thou art from everlasting.
