From the first letter of St Paul to the Thessalonians
!1 Thess  4:1-5
1 For the rest therefore, brethren, we pray and beseech you in the Lord Jesus, that as you have received from us, how you ought to walk, and to please God, so also you would walk, that you may abound the more.
2 For you know what precepts I have given to you by the Lord Jesus.
3 For this is the will of God, your sanctification; that you should abstain from fornication;
4 That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour:
5 Not in the passion of lust, like the Gentiles that know not God:

!1 Thess 4:6-8
6 And that no man overreach, nor circumvent his brother in business: because the Lord is the avenger of all these things, as we have told you before, and have testified.
7 For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto sanctification.
8 Therefore, he that despiseth these things, despiseth not man, but God, who also hath given his holy Spirit in us.

!1 Thess 4:9-11
9 But as touching the charity of brotherhood, we have no need to write to you: for yourselves have learned of God to love one another.
10 For indeed you do it towards all the brethren in all Macedonia. But we entreat you, brethren, that you abound more:
11 And that you use your endeavour to be quiet, and that you do your own business, and work with your own hands, as we commanded you: and that you walk honestly towards them that are without; and that you want nothing of any man's.
