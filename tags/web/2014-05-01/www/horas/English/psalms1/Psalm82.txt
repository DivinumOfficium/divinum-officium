82:1 O God, who shall be like to thee? * Hold not thy peace, neither be O God, thou still,
82:2 For lo, thy enemies have made a noise: * and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.
82:3 They have taken a malicious counsel against thy people, * and have consulted against thy saints.
82:4 They have said: Come and let us destroy them, * so that they be not a nation: and let the name of Israel be remembered no more.
82:5 For they have contrived with one consent: * they have made a covenant together against thee; the tabernacles of the Edomites, and the Ismahelites:
82:6 Moab, and the Agarens, Gebal, and Ammon and Amalec: * the Philistines, with the inhabitants of Tyre.
82:7 Yea, and the Assyrian also is joined with them: * they are come to the aid of the sons of Lot.
82:8 Do to them as thou didst to Madian and to Sisara: * as to Jabin at the brook of Cisson.
82:9 Who perished at Endor: * and became as dung for the earth.
82:10 Make their princes like Oreb, and Zeb, * and Zebee, and Salmana.
82:11 All their princes, * who have said: Let us possess the sanctuary of God for an inheritance.
82:12 O my God, make them like a wheel; * and as stubble before the wind.
82:13 As fire which burneth the wood: * and as a flame burning mountains:
82:14 So shalt thou pursue them with thy tempest: * and shalt trouble them in thy wrath.
82:15 Fill their faces with shame; * and they shall seek thy name, O Lord.
82:16 Let them be ashamed and troubled for ever and ever: * and let them be confounded and perish.
82:17 And let them know that the Lord is thy name: * thou alone art the most High over all the earth.
