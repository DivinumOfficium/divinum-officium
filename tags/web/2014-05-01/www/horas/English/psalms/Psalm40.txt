40:1 (Unto the end, a psalm for David himself.)
40:2 Blessed is he that understandeth concerning the needy and the poor: the Lord will deliver him in the evil day.
40:3 The Lord preserve him and give him life, and make him blessed upon the earth: and deliver him not up to the will of his enemies.
40:4 The Lord help him on his bed of sorrow: thou hast turned all his couch in his sickness.
40:5 I said: O Lord, be thou merciful to me: heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee.
40:6 My enemies have spoken evils against me: when shall he die and his name perish?
40:7 And if he came in to see me, he spoke vain things: his heart gathered together iniquity to itself. He went out and spoke to the same purpose.
40:8 All my enemies whispered together against me: they devised evils to me.
40:9 They determined against me an unjust word: shall he that sleepeth rise again no more?
40:10 For even the man of my peace, in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, hath greatly supplanted me.
40:11 But thou, O Lord, have mercy on me, and raise my up again: and I will requite them.
40:12 By this I know, that thou hast had a good will for me: because my enemy shall not rejoice over me.
40:13 But thou hast upheld me by reason of my innocence: and hast established me in thy sight for ever.
40:14 Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel from eternity to eternity. So be it. So be it.
