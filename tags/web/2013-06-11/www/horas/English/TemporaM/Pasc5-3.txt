From the Holy Gospel according to John 
!John 17:1-11 
At that time Jesus lifted~
up His Eyes to heaven, and spake these words Father, the hour is come~
glorify thy Son. And so on.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop of Hippo.
!104th Tract on John.
Our Lord, the Only-begotten and coeternal Son of the Father, was able, if need~
were, in and from the form of a servant, to pray in silence but He thus~
manifested Himself in prayer, remembering that He is our Teacher. Thus He made~
known unto us the prayer which He made for us since He was so great a Master~
that, not only His discourse to them, but His prayer to the Father for them, is~
an up-building to His disciples. And if it was so for them who were there to~
hear, truly it is so for us also for whose instruction it hath been written~
down.

[Responsory1]
R. I will sing a new song unto thee, O God Alleluia.
* Upon a psaltery of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee. Alleluia, Alleluia.
V. Thou art my God, and I will praise thee Thou art my God, and I will exalt thee.
R. Upon a psaltery of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee. Alleluia, Alleluia.

[Lectio2]
Wherefore, by these words: " Father, the hour is come glorify thy Son" He~
showeth that all time, and all whatsoever He doth, or alloweth to be done, and~
the season wherein He will do or allow it, is alike ordained of Him Who is~
Himself not subject to time. Yea, all things which were then to come, or are yet~
to come now, have the reason why they should be, in the Wisdom of God, Which is~
Itself independent of all time. " The hour is come." We must not believe that~
that hour was brought on by the march of destiny, but was by ordination of God.~
No stars decreed irresistibly that the time was come for Christ to suffer~
God forbid that the revolutions of His planets should force death on Him Who~
made them.

[Responsory2]
R. It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord Alleluia
* And to sing praises Alleluia.
V. Upon an instrument of ten strings, upon the harp with a solemn sound.
R. And to sing praises Alleluia.
&Gloria
R. And to sing praises Alleluia.

[Lectio3]
Come think that the glorification of the Son by the Father was that "He spared~
Him not, but delivered Him up for us all." (Rom. viii. 32.) But if we say that~
He was glorified by suffering, how much more shall we say that He was glorified~
by rising again While He suffered, His humbleness was more manifested than His~
glory, as witnesseth the Apostle, where he saith "He humbled Himself, and~
became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross" then he addeth~
touching His glorification "Wherefore God also hath highly exalted Him, and~
given Him a Name which is above every name, that at the Name of Jesus every knee~
should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth~
and that every tongue should confess that our Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory~
of God the Father." (Phil. ii. 8-11.) This is the glorification of our Lord~
Jesus Christ, that glorification whose first rays dawned on the Resurrection~
morning.

[Responsory3]
R. Let now the redeemed of the Lord Alleluia
* Say Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
V. Let them whom He hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy, and gathered them out of the lands.
R. Say Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
&Gloria
R. Say Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.

[Ant 2]
Father, the hour is come, * glorify thy Son, with the glory which I had, before the world was, with thee,alleluia.

[Oratio 2]
O God, from Whom all good things do come, grant to us thy humble servants that~
by thy holy inspiration we may think those things that be good, and by thy~
merciful guiding may perform the same.
$Per Dominum.

v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 17:1-11 
17:1 THESE things Jesus spoke, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said: Father, the hour is come, glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee.
17:2 As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he may give eternal life to all whom thou hast given him.
17:3 Now this is eternal life: That they may know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.
17:4 I have glorified thee on the earth; I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.
17:5 And now glorify thou me, O Father, with thyself, with the glory which I had, before the world was, with thee.
17:6 I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou hast given me out of the world. Thine they were, and to me thou gavest them; and they have kept thy word.
17:7 Now they have known, that all things which thou hast given me, are from thee:
17:8 Because the words which thou gavest me, I have given to them; and they have received them, and have known in very deed that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.
17:9 I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them whom thou hast given me: because they are thine:
17:10 And all my things are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.
17:11 And now I am not in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep them in thy name whom thou has given me; that they may be one, as we also are.
