03-12# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 34: Whether All Ought to Receive Necessaries Equally
_
As it is written: “They used to divide to each singly according as for him there was need”: and this we say not in order that there may be acceptance of persons, which be far from us, but consideration of infirmities. In the case of one who needs but little, let him give thanks to God and not be vexed; but as to him who needs rather more, let him be humbled on account of his infirmity and not puffed up on account of the consideration shewn him; and thus shall all the members be in peace. And, before all things, let not the evil of murmuring shew itself for any cause whatsoever, by any sign or word whatsoever. But if any shall have been found guilty of this fault let him be subjected to severe correction.
