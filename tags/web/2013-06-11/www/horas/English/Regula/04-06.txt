04-06# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 54: If a Monk Ought to Receive Letters Or Tokens
_
On no account let it be lawful for monks to receive, whether from parents or from other persons or from each other, letters, tokens, or any present whatsoever, nor yet to give them without the abbot’s permission; and if anything shall have been sent to a monk even from his parents let him not presume to receive it unless it shall first have been made known to the abbot; and even if he shall have ordered it to be received let it still be within his power as abbot to decide as to whom he will order it to be given; and let not the brother to whom by chance it had been sent be grieved, in order that occasion be not given to the devil. And if anyone shall have presumed to act otherwise, let him be subjected to the discipline of the rule.
