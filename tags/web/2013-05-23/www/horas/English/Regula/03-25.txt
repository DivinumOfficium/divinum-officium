03-25# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 45: Concerning Those Who Make Mistakes In the Oratory
_
If anyone shall have made a mistake in psalm, responsory, or antiphon or lection and unless he shall have there and then humbly made satisfaction before all, let him be subjected to severe punishment as one who was unwilling to correct by humility what by negligence he had done amiss. But in the case of the children, let them, for the like fault, be whipped.
