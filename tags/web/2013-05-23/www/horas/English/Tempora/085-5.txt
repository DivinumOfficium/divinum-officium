Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus
!Sir 21:1-5
1 My son, hast thou sinned? do so no more: but for thy former sins also pray that they may be forgiven thee.
2 Flee from sins as from the face of a serpent: for if thou comest near them, they will take hold of thee.
3 The teeth thereof are the teeth of a lion, killing the souls of men.
4 All iniquity is like a two-edged sword, there is no remedy for the wound thereof.
5 Injuries and wrongs will waste riches: and the house that is very rich shall be brought to nothing by pride: so the substance of the proud shall be rooted out.

!Sir 21:6-10
6 The prayer out of the mouth of the poor shall reach the ears of God, and judgment shall come for him speedily.
7 He that hateth to be reproved walketh in the trace of a sinner: and he that feareth God will turn to his own heart.
8 He that is mighty by a bold tongue is known afar off, but a wise man knoweth to slip by him.
9 He that buildeth his house at other men's charges, is as he that gathereth himself stones to build in the winter.
10 The congregation of sinners is like tow heaped together, and the end of them is a flame of fire.

!Sir 21:11-16
11 The way of sinners is made plain with stones, and in their end is hell, and darkness, and pains.
12 He that keepeth justice shall get the understanding thereof.
13 The perfection of the fear of God is wisdom and understanding.
14 He that is not wise in good, will not be taught.
15 But there is a wisdom that aboundeth in evil: and there is no understanding where there is bitterness.
16 The knowledge of a wise man shall abound like a flood, and his counsel continueth like a fountain of life
