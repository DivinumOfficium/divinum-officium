[Ant 1]
I beseech thee, O Lord, * remember now how I have walked before thee in truth~
and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight.

[Versum 1]
V. Vespertina oratio ascendat ad te Domine.
R. Et descendat super nos misericordia tua.

[Oratio]
Almighty and everlasting God, Who art always more ready to hear than we to pray,~
and art wont to give more than either we desire or deserve, pour down upon us~
the abundance of thy mercy, forgiving us those things whereof our conscience is~
afraid, and giving us those good things which we are not worthy to ask.

Olvasmány a Királyok második könyvébõl
!2 Kgs 20:1-3
1 Azokban a napokban Hiszkija halálos beteg lett. Elment hozzá Ámosz fia, Izajás, és így szólt hozzá: "Ezt mondja az Úr: Rendezd el házad ügyeit, mert meghalsz, nem maradsz életben." 
2 Erre arccal a fal felé fordulva így könyörgött az Úrhoz: 
3 "Ó, Uram, emlékezz rá, milyen hûségesen, mennyire osztatlan szívvel jártam színed elõtt, azt tettem, ami kedves a szemedben!" S keservesen sírt Hiszkija.

!2 Kgs 20:4-7
4 Izajás még nem hagyta el a középsõ udvart, amikor történt, hogy az Úr e szavakat intézte hozzá: 
5 "Térj vissza és mondd meg Hiszkijának, népem fejedelmének: Ezt mondja az Úr, õsödnek, Dávidnak Istene: Hallottam imádat, s láttam könnyeidet. Lásd, meggyógyítalak. Harmadnapra fölmész a templomhoz. 
6 S életed napjait megtoldom tizenöt esztendõvel. És kiszabadítalak Asszíria királyának hatalmából ezzel a várossal együtt; megvédem ezt a várost, magam miatt és szolgámnak, Dávidnak kedvéért." 
7 Akkor Izajás meghagyta: "Hozzatok nekem fügét!" Vittek, s rátették a kelésre. Nyomban meggyógyult.

8 Hiszkija azonban megkérdezte Izajástól: "Mi lesz a jel arra, hogy az Úr meggyógyít és harmadnap fölmehetek az Úr templomába?" 
9 "Az legyen-e a jel arra, hogy az Úr megteszi, amit ígért - kérdezte Izajás -, hogy az árnyék 10 fokkal elõremegy, vagy inkább az, hogy 10 fokkal hátrafelé megy?" 
10 "Túl könnyû volna - felelte Hiszkija - az árnyéknak 10 fokkal elõremennie; nem, menjen inkább 10 fokkal hátrafelé az árnyék." 
11 Erre Izajás próféta az Úrhoz könyörgött, s õ Acház lépcsõjén 10 fokkal visszahúzta az árnyékot.

The Lesson is taken From the Exposition of the Prophet Isaiah written by St~
Jerome, Priest at Bethlehem.
!Bk. ii. on Is. xxxviii.
Lest the heart of Hezekiah should be puffed up by his strange and unlooked for~
triumphs, and by his victory when he was but a prisoner, he was visited by~
bodily weakness, and told that he was to die that he might betake himself to~
the Lord, and turn Him from carrying out the sentence. We read of a like case in~
the history of the Prophet Jonah (ii. 4, 10.) And in regard to the threatening~
made against David (2 Kings (Sam.) xxiv. 16) — when punishments were foretold~
which were not brought to pass. This is not because that God is a Being capable~
of changing His mind, but because He willeth to mankind to know Him, how that~
"He [is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and]~
repenteth Him of the evil." (Joel ii. 13.) Hezekiah turned his face unto the~
wall, not being able to go up to the Temple. This may either mean that he turned~
towards the wall of the Temple, hard by which Solomon had built a palace, or~
simply, that he turned his face to the wall, so as not to parade his tears~
before his attendants.

[Lectio5]
Having been told that he was about to die, he prayed not for life and many years,~
but left it to God to do as in His good judgment He was pleased to will. He knew~
how this had pleased God on the part of Solomon. (3 (1) Kings iii. 11.) So, when~
he betook him to the Lord, he only made mention of his works, how he had walked~
before Him in truth, and with a perfect heart. Happy is he whose conscience in~
the hour of affliction can assure him of good works. Yea, "blessed are the pure~
in heart, for they shall see God " (Matth. v. 8.) It is indeed written in~
another place " Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my~
sin?" (Prov. xx. 9.) Howthen could Hezekiah say that he had walked with a~
perfect heart But the answer is, that by this is meant that he had destroyed~
the idols, opened the doors of the Temple, broken in pieces the brazen serpent,~
and done the rest of the things whereof the Scripture maketh mention.

"And Hezekiah wept sore." He had then no children, and it seemed as though the~
promise which God had made unto David, [that " his seed should endure for ever,~
and his throne as the sun before" Him, (Ps. lxxxviii. 29,)] was about to fail in~
his own death. It is written that " Manasseh was twelve years old when he began~
to reign," (xxi. 1) — whence it is evident that Hezekiah begat him not till~
after three years of his new lease of life. Sore therefore wept he, when all~
hope was torn from him that the Messiah should spring from his seed. Others~
again remark that he wept sore, since death terrifieth sometimes even the saints,~
since they know not what sentence is about to be pronounced upon them, and what~
place shall be allotted them in the inscrutable judgment.

!Mark 7:31-37
At that time Jesus, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, came unto the~
sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis. And so on.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory the Great.
!Horn. x. Bk. i. on Ezekiel.
What signifieth it that when God, the Maker of all, would heal a deaf and dumb~
man, "He put His Fingers into his ears, and He spit, and touched his tongue "~
What is figured by the Fingers of the Redeemer but the gifts of the Holy Ghost~
Hence it is written in another place (Luke xi. 20) that after He had cast out an~
evil spirit, He said " If I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt~
the kingdom of God is come upon you "  which words are thus given by another~
Evangelist (Matth. xii. 28)  " If I cast out devils by the Spirit of God,~
then the kingdom of God is come unto you." By setting these two passages~
together we see that the Spirit is called the Finger. For our Lord, then, to put~
His Fingers into the deaf man's ears was by the gift of the Holy Spirit to~
enlighten his dark mind unto obedience.

[Lectio8]
That signifieth it also that "He spit and touched his tongue " We receive~
spittle out of the Redeemer's mouth upon our tongues when we receive wisdom to~
speak God's truth. Spittle is a secretion of the head which floweth into the~
mouth. And so, that wisdom, which is Himself, the great Head of His Church, as~
soon as it hath touched our tongue, doth straightway take the form of preaching.~
"And looking up to heaven, He sighed," not that He had any need to sigh, Who~
gave whatsoever He asked, but that He was fain to teach us to look up and sigh~
toward Him Whose throne is in heaven, confessing our need, that our ears should~
be opened by the gift of the Holy Spirit, and our tongue loosed by the spittle~
of our Saviour's Mouth, that is, by knowledge of His Divine Word, before we can~
use it to preach to others.

[Lectio9]
"AND He said unto him Ephphatha that is Be opened. And straightway his ears~
were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed." Herein we must remark the~
command, "Be opened" was addressed to the deaf ears, but the tongue also was~
immediately loosed. Just so, when the ears of a man's heart have been opened to~
learn the obedience of faith, the string of his tongue also is thereupon loosed,~
that he may exhort others to do the good things which himself doth. It is well~
added "And he spake plain." He only doth well preach obedience to others who~
hath first learnt himself to obey.

When the Lord had departed from the coasts of Tyre, * He made both the deaf to~
hear and the dumb to speak.

V. The Lord reigneth He is clothed with majesty.
R. The Lord is clothed with strength, and hath girded Himself with power.

[Ant 3]
He hath done all things well, * He maketh both the deaf to hear and the dumb to~
speak.

[Versum 3]
V. Let my prayer, O Lord, be set forth.
R. As incense before thee.
