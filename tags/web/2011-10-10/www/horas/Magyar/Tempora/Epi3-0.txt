Szent Pál Apostolol Galatákhoz írt levelének kezdete
!Gal 1:1-5
1 Pál, aki nem emberektõl, nem is ember által, hanem Jézus Krisztus, és az õt a~
halálából föltámasztó Atyaisten által apostol,
2 és minden itteni testvér Galácia egyházainak:
3 Kegyelem és békesség nektek Atyánktól, az Istentõl és Urunktól, Jézus~
Krisztustól,
4 aki odaadta magát bûneinkért, hogy kiragadjon minket ebbõl a jelen gonosz~
világból, Istenünk és Atyánk rendelése szerint.
5 Övé legyen a dicsõség örökkön-örökké! Ámen.

!Gal 1:6-10
6 Csodálkozom, hogy attól, aki meghívott titeket Krisztus kegyelmére, ilyen~
hamar átpártoltatok egy más evangéliumhoz,
7 jóllehet nincs más, legföljebb néhány ember akad, aki megzavar titeket, és~
igyekszik elferdíteni Krisztus evangéliumát.
8 De ha akár mi, akár egy mennyei angyal más evangéliumot hirdetne nektek, mint~
amit mi hirdettünk: átkozott legyen!
9 Amint már kijelentettük, most újra megismételjük: Ha valaki más evangéliumot~
hirdetne nektek, mint amit tõlünk hallottatok, átkozott legyen!
10 Az emberek kedvét keresem ezzel vagy az Istenét? Talán embereknek akarok~
tetszeni? Ha még emberek tetszését keresném, nem volnék Krisztus szolgája.

!Gal 1:11-14
11 Biztosítalak benneteket, testvérek, hogy az általam hirdetett evangélium nem~
embertõl való.
12 Hiszen nem embertõl kaptam vagy tanultam, hanem Jézus Krisztus~
kinyilatkoztatásából.
13 Hallhattátok már, hogy azelõtt, még mint zsidó, milyen magatartást~
tanúsítottam: könyörtelenül üldöztem az Isten egyházát és a romlására törtem.
14 A zsidó vallásosságban számos fajtámbeli kortársamat felülmúltam, mert~
fölöttébb buzgó követõje voltam atyáim hagyományainak.

From the Exposition of the Epistle to the Galatians by St Austin, Bishop (of~
Hippo.)
!Preface, Bk. iv.
The reason of the Apostlés writing to the Galatians was this that they might~
understand that the grace of God had worked in them that they were no longer~
under the law. For when the grace of the Gospel was preached to them, there had~
not been wanting to them some of them of the circumcision, Christians indeed in~
name, but who had not yet apprehended that great benefit of grace, and desiring~
still to be bound with burdens of the law burdens which the Lord God had laid,~
not upon such as serve righteousness, but upon such as serve sin, laying, that~
is to say, upon the unrighteous a righteous law, whereby their unrighteousness~
was made manifest, not taken away. For there is not anything which taketh away~
sin, save only the grace of faith which worketh by love.

[Lectio5]
The men of the circumcision would have the Galatians, who were under grace, to~
be under the burdens of the law, persuading them that the Gospel profited them~
nothing, unless they should be circumcised, and take on them the other outward~
observances of the Jews' religion. Whence the Galatians began to have doubts of~
the Apostle Paul, by whom the Gospel had been preached to them, as one that held~
not the doctrine of the other Apostles, who compelled the Gentiles to come under~
the law.

[Lectio6]
The same question is discussed in the Epistle to the Romans, but with this~
difference in that case the Apostle putteth an end to the discussion, and~
stilleth the strife which had arisen between the Jewish and the Gentile converts,~
in consequence of the Jews holding that they had earned the knowledge of the~
Gospel as a reward for their observance of the law, and grudging the same~
knowledge to the uncircumcised, as to men who had done nothing to deserve it;~
and the Gentiles, on the contrary, maintaining that they were superior to the~
Jews, in that they were not the murderers of the Lord. Now, in this Epistle to~
the Galatians, the Apostle addresseth himself to those who were troubled by the~
authority claimed by them who were of the circumcision, and sought to bring into~
subjection to the law them who were of the uncircumcision.

Evangélium szent Máté könyvébõl
!Matt 8:1-13
Azon idõben amikor Jézus lejött a hegyrõl, nagy népsokaság követte. Egyszer csak~
odament hozzá egy leprás, leborult elõtte és kérte És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Bk. i. Comm. on Matth. viii.
When the Lord was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed Him.~
They were not able to follow Him when He went up. And first there came a leper.~
This poor creaturés disease had prevented him from hearing the Saviour's long~
sermon on the Mount. Let it be noted that he is the first person specially named~
as being healed. The second was the Centurion's servant; the third was Peter's~
wifés mother, who was sick of a fever at Capernaum; the fourth were they who~
were brought unto Christ as being troubled with evil spirits, from whom He by~
His word cast out the evil spirits, at the same time that He healed all that~
were sick.

[Lectio8]
And, behold, there came a leper, and worshipped Him, saying Properly after~
preaching and doctrine cometh occasion for a sign, that the power of the miracle~
might confirm in the hearers the truth of the teaching that had gone before.~
Lord, if Thou wilt, Thou canst make me clean. He that prayeth the Lord to have~
the will, doubteth not but that He hath the power. And Jesus put forth His hand,~
and touched him, saying I will; be thou clean. As soon as the Lord put forth His~
Hand the leprosy departed. Let us remark how lowly and unbragging is the Lord's~
language. The leper had said, If Thou wilt; the Lord answereth, I will. The~
leper, Thou canst make me clean, the Lord, Be thou clean. Most Latin readers,~
misled by the identity of form in that language between the Present Infinitive~
Active and the Second Person Singular Present Imperative Passive of the Verb,~
read Christ's answer as if it were, I will to make thee clean. This is wrong.~
The sentences are separate. First cometh the expression of volition, I will,~
then the command, Be thou clean.

[Lectio9]
And Jesus saith unto him See thou tell no man. What need was there to tell what~
his body showed? But go thy way, show thyself to the Priest. There were divers~
reasons why Christ should send him to the Priest. First, for humility's sake,~
that He might show reverence to God's Priest. Then there was a command in the~
law that they that were cleansed of leprosy should make an offering to the~
Priests. Moreover, that, when the Priests saw the leper cleansed, they might~
either believe in the Saviour, or refuse to believe; if they believed, that they~
might be saved, and, if they believed not, that they might have no excuse.~
Lastly, that He might give no ground for the accusation that was so often~
brought against Him, that He was unobservant of the law.
