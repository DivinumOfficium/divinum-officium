[Oratio]
O God, Who didst give unto thy saints Abdon and Sennen the abundant grace~
whereby to attain unto this glory, Grant unto thy servants the remission of all~
their sins, that, with the pleading of the worthy deeds of thy Saints, they may~
worthily be delivered from all things hurtful.
$Per Dominum

[Lectio93]
Abdon and Sennen were Persians. In the reign of the Emperor Decius they were~
accused of interring, on their own farm, the bodies of Christians, which had~
been thrown out unburied. The Emperor commanded them to be arrested and ordered~
to sacrifice to the gods. This they refused to do, and persistently preached~
that Jesus Christ is God, whereupon they were put into strict confinement. When~
Decius afterwards returned to Rome, he had them led in chains in his triumph.~
Being thus dragged into the city and up to the idols, they abhorred and spat~
upon them, for which they were cast to bears and lions; the beasts were afraid~
to touch them. They were butchered with the sword, and the corpses, with their~
feet bound together, were dragged before the image of the sun. Thence they were~
stolen away, and the Deacon Quirinus buried them in his own house.
