[Oratio]
O God, Who hast appointed thine Only - begotten Son to be the Saviour of mankind,~
and hast commanded that His Name should be called Jesus, mercifully grant that~
we who here on earth do worship that His most Holy Name may be made glad in~
heaven by His Presence.

[Lectio1]
From the letter of blessed Apostle Paul to the Romans
!Rom 6:1-5
6:1 What shall we say, then? shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
6:2 God forbid. For we that are dead to sin, how shall we live any longer~
therein?
6:3 Know you not that all we, who are baptized in Christ Jesus, are baptized in~
his death?
6:4 For we are buried together with him by baptism into death; that as Christ is~
risen from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also may walk in newness~
of life.
6:5 For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall~
be also in the likeness of his resurrection.

!Rom 6:6-11
6:6 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin~
may be destroyed, to the end that we may serve sin no longer.
6:7 For he that is dead is justified from sin.
6:8 Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall live also together~
with Christ:
6:9 Knowing that Christ rising again from the dead, dieth now no more, death~
shall no more have dominion over him.
6:10 For in that he died to sin, he died once; but in that he liveth, he liveth~
unto God:
6:11 So do you also reckon, that you are dead to sin, but alive unto God, in~
Christ Jesus our Lord.

[Lectio3]
!Rom 6:12-15
6:12 Let no sin therefore reign in your mortal body, so as to obey the lusts~
thereof.
6:13 Neither yield ye your members as instruments of iniquity unto sin; but~
present yourselves to God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your~
members as instruments of justice unto God.
6:14 For sin shall not have dominion over you; for you are not under the law,~
but under grace.
6:15 What then? Shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace?~
God forbid.
