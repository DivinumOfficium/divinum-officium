[Lectio1]
From the Book of Wisdom
!Wis 13:1-3
1 But all men are vain, in whom there is not the knowledge of God: and who by~
these good things that are seen, could not understand him that is, neither by~
attending to the works have acknowledged who was the workman:
2 But have imagined either the fire, or the wind, or the swift air, or the~
circle of the stars, or the great water, or the sun and moon, to be the gods~
that rule the world.
3 With whose beauty, if they, being delighted, took them to be gods: let them~
know how much the Lord of them is more beautiful than they: for the first author~
of beauty made all those things.

!Wis 13:4-7
4 Or if they admired their power and their effects, let them understand by them,~
that he that made them, is mightier than they:
5 For by the greatness of the beauty, and of the creature, the creator of them~
may be seen, so as to be known thereby.
6 But yet as to these they are less to be blamed. For they perhaps err, seeking~
God, and desirous to find him.
7 For being conversant among his works, they search: and they are persuaded that~
the things are good which are seen.

!Wis 13:8-10
8 But then again they are not to be pardoned.
9 For if they were able to know so much as to make a judgment of the world: how~
did they not more easily find out the Lord thereof?
10 But unhappy are they, and their hope is among the dead, who have called gods~
the works of the hands of men, gold and silver, the inventions of art, and the~
resemblances of beasts, or an unprofitable stone the work of an ancient hand.
