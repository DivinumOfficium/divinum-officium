Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus
!Ecclus 31:8-11
Happy the man found without fault, who turns not aside after gain, nor puts his trust in money nor in treasures! Who is he, that we may praise him? For he has done wonders in his life. He has been tested by gold and come off safe, and this remains his glory forever; he could have sinned but did not, could have done evil but would not, so that his possessions are secure in the Lord, and the assembly of the Saints shall recount his alms.

[Graduale]

Alleluia, alleluia.
!James
!1:12
V. Blessed is the man who endures temptation; for when he has been tried, he~
will receive the crown of life. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 6:24-33
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples: No man can serve two masters; for~
either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will stand by the one~
and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon. Therefore I say to you,~
do not be anxious for your life, what you shall eat; nor yet for your body, what~
you shall put on. Is not the life a greater thing than the food, and the body~
than the clothing? Look at the birds of the air: they do not sow, or reap, or~
gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are not you of much~
more value than they? But which of you by being anxious about it can add to his~
stature a single cubit? And as for clothing, why are you anxious? Consider how~
the lilies of the field grow; they neither toil nor spin, yet I say to you that~
not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed like one of these. But if God so~
clothes the grass of the field, which flourishes today but tomorrow is thrown~
into the oven, how much more you, O you of little faith! Therefore do not be~
anxious, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or, ‘What shall we drink?’ or, ‘What are~
we to put on?’ -for after all these things the Gentiles seek- for your Father~
knows that you need all these things. But seek first the kingdom of God and His~
justice, and all these things shall be given you besides.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 88:25
My faithfulness and My kindness shall be with him, and through My name shall his~
horn be exalted.

[Secreta]
Grant, we beseech You, almighty God, that our humble offerings may be pleasing~
to You as an honor paid to Your saints, and may cleanse us in body and soul.

Amen I say to you, he will set him over all his goods. (Alleluia.)
