97:1 (A psalm for David himself.) Sing ye to the Lord a new canticle: because he hath done wonderful things. His right hand hath wrought for him salvation, and his arm is holy.
97:2 The Lord hath made known his salvation: he hath revealed his justice in the sight of the Gentiles.
97:3 He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
97:4 Sing joyfully to God, all the earth; make melody, rejoice and sing.
97:5 Sing praise to the Lord on the harp, on the harp, and with the voice of a psalm:
97:6 With long trumpets, and sound of cornet. Make a joyful noise before the Lord our king:
97:7 Let the sea be moved and the fullness thereof: the world and they that dwell therein.
97:8 The rivers shall clap their hands, the mountains shall rejoice together
97:9 At the presence of the Lord: because he cometh to judge the earth. He shall judge the world with justice, and the people with equity.
