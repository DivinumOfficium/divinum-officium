[Oratio]
Most merciful God, Who when the holy Abbot Sylvester was devoutly meditating~
upon the vanity of this world beside an open grace, graciously willed to call~
him into the desert and enrich him with unusual merits, we humbly pray that,~
following his example, despising the things of earth, we may thoroughly enjoy~
Your everlasting presence.

Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus
!Sir 45:1-6
Beloved of God and men, whose memory is held in benediction. He made him like the Saints in glory, and magnified him in the fear of his enemies, and with his words He made prodigies to cease. He glorified him in the sight of kings, and gave him Commandments in the sight of his people, and revealed to him His glory. He sanctified him in his faith and meekness, and chose him out of all flesh. For He heard him and his voice, and brought him into a cloud. And, face to face, He gave him the Commandments, the law of life and understanding.

!Matt 19:27-29
At that time, Peter said to Jesus, Behold, we have left all and followed You;~
what then shall we have? And Jesus said to them, Amen I say to you that you who~
have followed Me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man shall sit on the~
throne of His glory, shall also sit on the throne of His glory, shall also sit~
on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And everyone who has~
left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children,~
or lands, for My name’s sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall possess~
life everlasting.
