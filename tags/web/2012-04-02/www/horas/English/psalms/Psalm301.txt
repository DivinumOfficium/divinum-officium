30:1 (Unto the end, a psalm for David, in an ecstasy.)
30:2 In thee, O Lord, have I hoped, let me never be confounded: deliver me in thy justice.
30:3 Bow down thy ear to me: make haste to deliver me. Be thou unto me a God, a protector, and a house of refuge, to save me.
30:4 For thou art my strength and my refuge; and for thy name's sake thou wilt lead me, and nourish me.
30:5 Thou wilt bring me out of this snare, which they have hidden for me: for thou art my protector.
30:6 Into thy hands I commend my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, the God of truth.
