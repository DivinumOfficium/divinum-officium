From the Holy Gospel according to Luke.
!Luke 24:13-35
And behold, two of them went, the same day, to a town which was sixty furlongs~
from Jerusalem, named Emmaus. And so on.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great)
!23rd on the Gospels.
Dearly beloved brethren, ye hear, how that while two of His disciples walked~
together in the way, not believing in His Resurrection, but talking, together~
concerning Him, the Lord manifested Himself unto them, but yet held their eyes~
that they should not know Him. This holding of the eyes of their body, wrought~
by the Lord, was a figure of the spiritual veil which was yet upon the eyes of~
their heart. For in their heart they loved and yet doubted : even as the Lord~
drew near to them outwardly, but showed not Who He was. To them that talked~
together of Him, He revealed His immediate presence; but hid, from them that~
doubted, the knowledge of His Person.

[Responsory1]
R. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went very early to the sepulchre.
* That Jesus whom ye seek, is not here : for He is risen, as He said : He goeth~
before you into Galilee; there shall ye see Him. Alleluia, Alleluia.
V. And very early in the morning, the first day of the week, they came unto the~
sepulchre, at the rising of the sun; and, entering into the sepulchre, they saw a~
young man sitting upon the right side, who saith unto them :
R. That Jesus Whom ye seek is not here : for He is risen, as He said : He goeth~
before you into Galilee : there shall ye see Him. Alleluia, Alleluia.

[Lectio2]
He spoke to them; He rebuked the hardness of their heart; He expounded unto them~
in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself: and, nevertheless, seeing~
that He was yet a stranger to faith in their hearts, He made as though He would~
have gone further. These words He made as though would here seem to mean He~
feigned, but He Who is simple Truth doth nothing with feigning : He only~
showed Himself to them in bodily manners, as He was towards them spiritually;~
but they were put to the proof whether, though they loved Him not yet as their~
God, they could love Him at least as a wayfarer.

[Responsory2]
R. The Good Shepherd, Who laid down His life for the sheep, yea, Who was~
contented even to die for His flock, the Good Shepherd is risen again.
* Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
V. For even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us.
R. Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
&Gloria
R. Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.

[Lectio3]
But since it was impossible, that they with whom Truth walked, should be~
loveless, they asked Him as a wayfarer to take of their hospitality. But why say~
we that they asked Him, when it is written : And they constrained Him? From~
their ensample we learn that we ought not only to bid, but also to urge,~
wayfarers to our hospitable entertainment. They laid a table therefore, and set~
before Him bread and meat; and that God Whom they had not known in the~
expounding of the Holy Scripture, they knew in the breaking of bread. In hearing~
the commandments of God they were not enlightened, but they were enlightened in~
the doing of them : as it is written : Not the hearers of the law are just~
before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified. (Rom. ii. 13.)~
Whosoever therefore will understand that which he heareth, let him make haste to~
practise in his works that which he hath already been able to hear. Behold, the~
Lord was not known while He spake, but He was contented to be known when He~
brake bread.

[Ant 2]
While they walked * Jesus drew near, and went with His disciples : but their~
eyes were holden that they should not know Him : and He rebuked them, saying : O~
fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the Prophets have spoken! Alleluia.

[Oratio]
O God, Who dost heal the sick world by the solemn gladness of the Passover,~
continue, we beseech thee! to pour forth thine heavenly gifts upon thy people,~
till the same shall bring them into perfect liberty, and finally avail them unto~
life everlasting.
$Per Dominum.

[Ant 3]
What manner of communications are these * that ye have one to another, as ye~
walk, and are sad? Alleluia.

v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 24:13-35
24:13 And behold, two of them went, the same day, to a town which was sixty furlongs from Jerusalem, named Emmaus.
24:14 And they talked together of all these things which had happened.
24:15 And it came to pass, that while they talked and reasoned with themselves, Jesus himself also drawing near, went with them.
24:16 But their eyes were held, that they should not know him.
24:17 And he said to them: What are these discourses that you hold one with another as you walk, and are sad?
24:18 And the one of them, whose name was Cleophas, answering, said to him: Art thou only a stranger to Jerusalem, and hast not known the things that have been done there in these days?
24:19 To whom he said: What things? And they said: Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet, mighty in work and word before God and all the people;
24:20 And how our chief priests and princes delivered him to be condemned to death, and crucified him.
24:21 But we hoped, that it was he that should have redeemed Israel: and now besides all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.
24:22 Yea and certain women also of our company affrighted us, who before it was light, were at the sepulchre,
24:23 And not finding his body, came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who say that he is alive.
24:24 And some of our people went to the sepulchre, and found it so as the women had said, but him they found not.
24:25 Then he said to them: O foolish, and slow of heart to believe in all things which the prophets have spoken.
24:26 Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and so to enter into his glory?
24:27 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded to them in all the scriptures, the things that were concerning him.
24:28 And they drew night to the town, whither they were going: and he made as though he would go farther.
24:29 But they constrained him; saying: Stay with us, because it is towards evening, and the day is now far spent. And he went in with them.
24:30 And it came to pass, whilst he was at table with them, he took bread, and blessed, and brake, and gave to them.
24:31 And their eyes were opened, and they knew him: and he vanished out of their sight.
24:32 And they said one to the other: Was not our heart burning within us, whilst he spoke in this way, and opened to us the scriptures?
24:33 And rising up, the same hour, they went back to Jerusalem: and they found the eleven gathered together, and those that were staying with them,
24:34 Saying: The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.
24:35 And they told what things were done in the way; and how they knew him in the breaking of the bread.
