From the Prophet Daniel
!Dan  5:1-6
1  Baltasar the king made a great feast for a thousand of his nobles: and every one drank according to his age.
2  And being now drunk he commanded that they should bring the vessels of gold and silver which Nabuchodonosor his father had brought away out of the temple, that was in Jerusalem, that the king and his nobles, and his wives and his concubines, might drink in them.
3  Then were the golden and silver vessels brought, which he had brought away out of the temple that was in Jerusalem: and the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines, drank in them.
4  They drank wine, and praised their gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, and of wood, and of stone.
5  In the same hour there appeared fingers, as it were of the hand of a man, writing over against the candlestick upon the surface of the wall of the king's palace: and the king beheld the joints of the hand that wrote.
6  Then was the king's countenance changed, and his thoughts troubled him: and the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees struck one against the other.

!Dan 5:13-17
13  Then Daniel was brought in before the king. And the king spoke, and said to him: Art thou Daniel of the children of the captivity of Juda, whom my father the king brought out of Judea?
14  I have heard of thee, that thou hast the spirit of the gods, and excellent knowledge, and understanding, and wisdom are found in thee.
15  And now the wise men the magicians have come in before me, to read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof: and they could not declare to me the meaning of this writing.
16  But I have heard of thee, that thou canst interpret obscure things, and resolve difficult things: now if thou art able to read the writing, and to shew me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with purple, and shalt have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third prince in my kingdom.
17  To which Daniel made answer, and said before the king: thy rewards be to thyself, and the gifts of thy house give to another: but the writing I will read to thee, O king, and shew thee the interpretation thereof.

!Dan 5:25-31
25  And this is the writing that is written: MANE, THECEL, PHARES.
26  And this is the interpretation of the word. MANE: God hath numbered thy kingdom, and hath finished it.
27  THECEL: thou art weighed in the balance, and art found wanting.
28  PHARES: thy kingdom is divided, and is given to the Medes and Persians.
29  Then by the king's command Daniel was clothed with purple, and a chain of gold was put about his neck: and it was proclaimed of him that he had power as the third man in the kingdom.
30  The same night Baltasar the Chaldean king was slain.
31  And Darius the Mede succeeded to the kingdom, being threescore and two years old.
