Lesson from the second book of Samuel
!2 Sam 2:1-4
1 And after these things David consulted the Lord, saying: Shall I go up into~
one of the cities of Juda? And the Lord said to him: Go up. And David said:~
Whither shall I go up? And he answered him: Into Hebron.
2 So David went up, and his two wives, Achinoam the Jezrahelitess, and Abigail~
the wife of Nabal of Carmel:
3 And the men also that were with him, David brought up every man with his~
household: and they abode in the towns of Hebron.
4 And the men of Juda came, and anointed David there, to be king over the house~
of Juda.

!2 Sam 2:4-7
4 And it was told David, that the men of Jabes Galaad had buried Saul.
5 David therefore sent messengers to the men of Jabes Galaad, and said to them:~
Blessed be you to the Lord, who have shown this mercy to your master Saul, and~
have buried him.
6 And now the Lord surely will render you mercy and truth, and I also will,~
requite you for this good turn, because you have done this thing.
7 Let your hands be strengthened, and be ye men of valour: for although your~
master Saul be dead, yet the house of Juda hath anointed me to be their king

8 But Abner the son of Ner, general of Saul's army, took Isboseth the son of~
Saul, and led him about through the camp?
9 And made him king over Galaad, and, over Gessuri, and over Jezrahel, and over~
Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.
10 Isboseth the son of Saul was forty years old when he began to reign over,~
Israel, and he reigned two years: and only the house of Juda followed David.

house of Juda, was seven years and six months.
