God, who year by year dost gladden us by the solemn feast day of thy Blessed~
Martin Martyr and Pontifex, mercifully grant that we who keep his birthday, may~
ever feel the joyful effects of his protection.
$Per Dominum

[Lectio4]
Martin was born at Todi in Tuscany. At the beginning of his Popedom, (in the~
year 649,) he was careful to send an embassage with letters to Paul, Patriarch~
of Constantinople, to call upon him to return to the truth of the Catholic faith~
from the blasphemous heresy (of the Monothelites.) But Paul, being backed up by~
the heretic Emperor Constans, had become so rabid, that he sent away the~
messengers of the Apostolic See into divers places in the islands. This crime~
moved the Pope to gather together at Rome a council of one - hundred - and five~
Bishops, by whom Paul was condemned.

[Lectio5]
Thereupon Constans sent Olympius into Italy as Exarch, straitly commanding him~
either to slay Pope Martin, or else to bring him into his Imperial presence.~
Olympius therefore came to Rome and bade a lictor to kill the Pope while as he~
was celebrating the Liturgy solemnly in the Cathedral Church of St~
Mary-at-the-Manger. But when the lictor went thither, he was struck with~
blindness.

[Lectio6]
From that time forth many evils befell the Emperor Constans; but he repented~
not. He sent the Exarch Theodore Calliopas to Rome, with command to lay hands on~
the Pope. By him Martin was treacherously taken (on the 17th day of June, 653,)~
and (forthwith carried to the island of Naxos. On the 17th of September in 654~
he was) brought to Constantinople, (where he was kept in prison) till he was~
sent to the Crimea (on the 15th of May, 655.) There his sufferings for the~
Catholic faith utterly broke him down, and he left this life for a better, upon~
the 12th day of November, (in the same year 655.) He was famous for miracles.~
His body was afterwards brought back to Rome and buried in the Church dedicated~
under the names of St Silvester and St Martin (of Tours.) He ruled the Church~
for six years, one month, and twenty-six days. He held two ordinations in the~
month of December, wherein he made eleven Priests, five Deacons, and thirtythree~
Bishops for divers places.

[Lectio94]
Born at Todi in Umbria, Martin accepted at the beginning of his pontificate to recall Paul of Constantinople, a heretic to the Catholic faith, by sending letter and legates. But Paul, supported by the emperor Constans, banished the legates of the Apostolic See to various islands. The Pope aroused by this crime, gathered at Rome a council of hundred and five bishops, who condemned Paul. During the council the emperor sent the exarch Olympius to Italy, to depose the Pope. But Olympius died a miserable death, after failing to harm Martin any way. Then on the emperors orders Theodore Kalliopes took over the Lateran Basilica and the nearby residence of the pope, and arrested Martin, first sending him to the island of Naxos, and then bringing him to Constantinople.  Here the holy pope was chained and suffered mockery and insults. Exiled to the Chersonesus, he departed his life in the beginning of the eight year of his pontificate, worn out with hardship and destitution for the sake of the Catholic faith. His body was later taken to Rome and was burried in the Church dedicated to SS. Sylvester and Martin.

Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kõnyvébõl
!Matt 16:13-19
Azon idõben Amikor Jézus Fülöp Cezáreájának vidékére ért, megkérdezte~
tanítványaitól: "Kinek tartják az emberek az Emberfiát? És így tovább
_
Homily by Pope St Leo (the Great)
!2nd on the anniversary of his own election.
When the Lord, as we read in the Evangelist, asked His disciples : Who did men,~
amid their divers speculations, believe that He, the Son of Man, was; blessed~
Peter answered and said : Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. And~
Jesus answered and said unto him : Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona : for flesh~
and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but My Father, Which is in : and I say~
also unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My Church,~
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it; and I will give unto thee~
the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall~
be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in~
heaven. Thus therefore standeth the ordinance of the Truth, and blessed Peter,~
abiding still that firm rock which God hath made him, hath never lost that right~
to rule in the Church which God hath given unto him.

[Lectio8] 
In the universal Church it is Peter that doth still say every day,~
Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God, and every tongue which~
confesseth that JESUS is Lord is taught that confession by the teaching of~
Peter. This is the faith that overcometh the devil and looseth the bands of his~
prisoners. This is the faith which maketh men free of the world and bringeth~
them to heaven, and the gates of hell are impotent to prevail against it. With~
such ramparts of salvation hath God fortified this rock, that the contagion of~
heresy will never be able to infect it, nor idolatry and unbelief to overcome~
it. This teaching it is, my dearly beloved brethren, which maketh the keeping of~
this Feast to-day to be our reasonable service, even the teaching which maketh~
you to know and honour in myself, lowly though I be, that Peter who is still~
entrusted with the care of all other shepherds and of all the flocks to them~
committed, and whose authority I have, albeit unworthy to be his heir.

[Lectio9]
When therefore, we address our exhortations to your godly ears,
1 believe ye that ye are hearing him speak whose office we are discharging. Yea,~
it is with his love for you that we warn you, and we preach unto you no other~
thing than that which he taught, entreating you that ye would gird up the loins~
of your mind and lead pure and sober lives in the fear of God. 2 My disciples~
dearly beloved, ye are to me, as the disciples of the Apostle Paul were to him,~
~(Phil. iv. 1,) a crown and a joy, if your faith, which, in the first times of~
the Gospel, was spoken of throughout the whole world, (Rom. i. 8,) abide still~
lovely and holy. For, albeit it behoveth the whole Church which is spread~
throughout all the world, to be strong in righteousness, you it chiefly becometh~
above all other peoples to excel in worth and godliness, whose house is built~
upon the very crown of the Rock of the Apostle, and whom not only hath our Lord~
Jesus Christ, as He hath redeemed all men, but whom also His blessed Apostle~
Peter hath made the foremost object of his teaching.
