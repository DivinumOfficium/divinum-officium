78:1 O God, the heathens are come into thy inheritance, they have defiled thy holy temple: * they have made Jerusalem as a place to keep fruit.
78:2 They have given the dead bodies of thy servants to be meat for the fowls of the air: * the flesh of thy saints for the beasts of the earth.
78:3 They have poured out their blood as water, round about Jerusalem, * and there was none to bury them.
78:4 We are become a reproach to our neighbours: * a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.
78:5 How long, O Lord, wilt thou be angry for ever: * shall thy zeal be kindled like a fire?
78:6 Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that have not known thee: * and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.
78:7 Because they have devoured Jacob; * and have laid waste his place.
78:8 Remember not our former iniquities: let thy mercies speedily prevent us, * for we are become exceeding poor.
78:9 Help us, O God, our saviour: and for the glory of thy name, O Lord, deliver us: * and forgive us our sins for thy name's sake:
78:10 Lest they should say among the Gentiles: Where is their God? * And let him be made known among the nations before our eyes,
78:11 By the revenging the blood of thy servants, which hath been shed: * let the sighing of the prisoners come in before thee.
78:12 According to the greatness of thy arm, * take possession of the children of them that have been put to death.
78:13 And render to our neighbours sevenfold in their bosom: * the reproach wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.
78:14 But we thy people, and the sheep of thy pasture, * will give thanks to thee for ever.
78:15 We will shew forth thy praise, * unto generation and generation.
