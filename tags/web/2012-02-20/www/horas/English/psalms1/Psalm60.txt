60:1 Hear, O God, my supplication: *	be attentive to my prayer.
60:2 To thee have I cried from the ends of the earth: * when my heart was in anguish, thou hast exalted me on a rock.
60:3 Thou hast conducted me; for thou hast been my hope: * a tower of strength against the face of the enemy.
60:4 In thy tabernacle I shall dwell for ever: * I shall be protected under the covert of thy wings.
60:5 For thou, my God, hast heard my prayer: * thou hast given an inheritance to them that fear thy name. 
60:6 Thou wilt add days to the days of the king: * his years even to generation and generation.
60:7 He abideth for ever in the sight of God: * his mercy and truth who shall search?
60:8 So will I sing a psalm to thy name for ever and ever: * that I may pay my vows from day to day.
