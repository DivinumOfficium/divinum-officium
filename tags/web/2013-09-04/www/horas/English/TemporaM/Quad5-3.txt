From the holy Gospel according to John
!John 10:22-38
In that time it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem: and it was winter.~
And Jesus walked in the temple, in Solomon's porch. And so on.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of H ippo. )
!42th Tract on John.
The Greek word Enkainia, used by the Evangelist, signifieth the Feast of the~
Dedication of the Temple. The derivation thereof is kainon, which is, being~
interpreted, new; and the Dedication of anything new is thence called Enkainia.~
The use of this word is still preserved among ourselves; if any man put on his~
new coat for the first time we say that he enkainiateth. It was the use of the~
Jews to keep solemn holiday upon the Anniversary of the Dedication of the Temple,~
and this was the Feast-day which was being observed when the Lord spake the~
words which have been read.

It was winter. And Jesus walked in the Temple in Solomon's Porch. Then came the~
Jews round about Him, and said unto Him How long dost Thou make us to doubt?~
If Thou be the Christ, tell us plainly. They sought not to know the truth, but~
to have whereof to accuse Him. It was winter, and they were cold; for they were~
slow to draw near to God's fire. If to believe is to draw near thereto, then he~
which believeth draweth near thereto and he which denieth, goeth away~
therefrom. The feet of the soul, by which it moveth, are the affections thereof.

They were frozen with want of love, and at the same time on fire with thirst to~
do injury. They stood afar off, and yet came near; for though they drew not near~
by faith, they were eager to persecute. They sought to hear the Lord say I am~
the Christ; and perchance they knew somewhat concerning Christ, as touching His~
Manhood, for the Prophets had prophesied of Christ. But the Godhead of Christ~
even some heretics do not see witnessed either in the Prophets or in the Gospel;~
how much less the Jews, as long as the veil is upon their heart. (2 Cor. iii.~
15.)

[Ant 2]
My sheep hear My voice, * and I, the Lord, know them.

[Oratio 2]
God, be mercifully pleased, through the hallowing of this Fast, to shed light~
upon the hearts of thy faithful people, and since Thou hast given them the mind~
to pray, let thy pitiful ears be opened graciously to hear their supplications.
$Per Dominum

[Ant 3]
Many good works have I wrought * among you, and for them ye go about to kill Me.

[Oratio 3]
Gratiously hear our prayers, O Almighty God, and as Thou dost give us to look~
with confidence for thy favour for which we hope, so grant us, in thy goodness,~
the manifestation of thine accustomed mercy.
$Per Dominum.

v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 10:22-38
10:22 And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem: and it was winter.
10:23 And Jesus walked in the temple, in Solomon's porch.
10:24 The Jews therefore came round about him, and said to him: How long dost thou hold our souls in suspense? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.
10:25 Jesus answered them: I speak to you, and you believe not: the works that I do in the name of my Father, they give testimony of me.
10:26 But you do not believe, because you are not of my sheep.
10:27 My sheep hear my voice: and I know them, and they follow me.
10:28 And I give them life everlasting; and they shall not perish for ever, and no man shall pluck them out of my hand.
10:29 That which my Father hath given me, is greater than all: and no one can snatch them out of the hand of my Father.
10:30 I and the Father are one.
10:31 The Jews then took up stones to stone him.
10:32 Jesus answered them: Many good works I have shewed you from my Father; for which of these works do you stone me?
10:33 The Jews answered him: For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, maketh thyself God.
10:34 Jesus answered them: Is it not written in your law: I said you are gods?
10:35 If he called them gods, to whom to word of God was spoken, and the scripture cannot be broken;
10:36 Do you say of him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world: Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God?
10:37 If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.
10:38 But if I do, though you will not believe me, believe the works: that you may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.
