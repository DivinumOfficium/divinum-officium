Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 1:26-38
In that time the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee, called~
Nazareth, To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of~
David; and the virgin's name was Mary. And so on.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan,)
!Bk. ii. on Luke.
The mysteries of God are unsearchable, and it is especially declared by a~
Prophet, that a man can hardly know His counsels. (Wisd. ix. 13.) Nevertheless,~
some things have been revealed to us, and we may gather from some of the words~
and works of the Lord our Saviour, that there was a special purpose of God, in~
the fact that she who was chosen to be the mother of the Lord was espoused to a~
man. Why did not the power of the Highest overshadow her before she was so~
espoused? Perhaps it was lest any might blasphemously say that she had conceived~
in adultery the Holy One.

[Responsory1]
R. O thou that bringest good tidings of peace to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice~
with strength!
* Say unto the cities of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem Behold,~
our God will come, for Whom we waited.
V. O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion get thee up into the high mountain,~
lift up thy voice with strength.
R. Say unto the cities of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem Behold,~
our God will come, for Whom we waited.

[Lectio2]
And the Angel came in unto her. Let us learn from this Virgin how to bear~
ourselves, let us learn her modesty, let us learn by her devout utterance, above~
all let us learn by the holy mystery enacted. It is the part of a maiden to be'~
timid, to avoid the advances of men, and to shrink from men's addresses. Would~
that our women would learn from the example of modesty here set before us. She~
upon whom the stare of men had never been fixed was alone in her chamber, and~
she found herself alone with Angels. There was neither companion nor witness~
there, that what passed might not be debased in gossip and the Angel saluted~
her.

[Responsory2]
R. There shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Man shall rise out of Israel, and~
shall smite through all the princes of the aliens.
* And all the earth shall be His possession.
V. All kings shall fall down before Him, all nations shall serve Him.
R. And all the earth shall be His possession.

[Lectio3]
The message of God to the Virgin was a mystery, which it was not lawful for the~
mouth of men, but only of Angels, to utter. For the first time on earth the~
words are spoken The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee. The holy maiden heareth,~
and believeth. At length she said Behold the handmaid of the Lord be it~
unto me according to thy word. Here is an example of lowliness, here is a~
pattern of true devotion. At the very moment that she is told she is chosen to~
be the mother of the Lord she at once declareth herself His handmaid. The~
knowledge that she was mother of God caused in the heart of Mary only an act of~
humility.

[Responsory3]
R. The Lord, the Ruler, cometh quickly.
* And His name shall be called Emmanuel.
V. In His days shall righteousness flourish, and abundance of peace.
R. And His name shall be called Emmanuel.
&Gloria
R. And His name shall be called Emmanuel.

[Ant 2]
The angel Gabriel * was sent to Mary, a virgin espoused to Joseph.

[Oratio]
Grant, we beseech thee, Almighty God, that the solemn Feast of our redemption,~
which is now at hand, may both help us in the life which now is, and further us~
toward the attaining of thine eternal joy in that which is to come. Through our~
Lord Jesus Christ thy Son,

[Ant 3]
Behold the handmaid * of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word.

Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 1:26-38
1:26 And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee, called Nazareth,
1:27 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.
1:28 And the angel being come in, said unto her: Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.
1:29 Who having heard, was troubled at his saying, and thought with herself what manner of salutation this should be.
1:30 And the angel said to her: Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found grace with God.
1:31 Behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and shalt bring forth a son; and thou shalt call his name Jesus.
1:32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the most High; and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of David his father; and he shall reign in the house of Jacob for ever.
1:33 And of his kingdom there shall be no end.
1:34 And Mary said to the angel: How shall this be done, because I know not man?
1:35 And the angel answering, said to her: The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the most High shall overshadow thee. And therefore also the Holy which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.
1:36 And behold thy cousin Elizabeth, she also hath conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her that is called barren:
1:37 Because no word shall be impossible with God.
1:38 And Mary said: Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it done to me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.
