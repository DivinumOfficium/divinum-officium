O God, Who didst make unto thyself a pleasant dwelling-place in the heart of thy~
blessed hand-maiden Gertrude, be Thou entreated for the same thy servant's sake,~
and by her prayers, to purge away in thy mercy all defilement from our hearts,~
and to grant us one day to rejoice with her in thy presence.

[Lectio4]
Gertrude was born of a noble family at Eisleben, in Saxony, (about the year of~
our Lord 1264.) At five years of age she offered her virginity and herself to~
Jesus Christ, in the Benedictine nunnery at Rodalsdorf. From that time forth she~
was utterly estranged from earthly things, ever striving for things higher, and~
began to lead a kind of heavenly life. To learning in human letters she added~
knowledge of the things of God. In the thought thereof she earnestly desired,~
and soon reached, the perfection of a Christian soul. Of Christ, and of the~
things in His life, she spoke oftentimes with movings of spirit. The glory of~
God was the one end of all her thoughts, and to that her every longing and her~
every act were given. Though God had crowned her with so many and so noble gifts~
both of nature and of grace, her belief regarding herself was so humble that she~
was used to number as among the greatest of the wonders of His goodness that He~
had always in His mercy borne with one who was so utterly unworthy.

[Lectio5]
In the thirtieth year of her age she was elected Abbess of Rodalsdorf, where she~
had professed herself in the religious life, and afterwards of Heldelfs. This~
office she bore for forty years in love, wisdom, and zeal for strict observance,~
so that the house seemed like an ideal ensample of a sisterhood of perfect nuns.~
To each one she was a mother and a teacher, and yet would be as the least of all,~
being in sooth in all lowliness among them as she that served. That she might be~
more utterly God's only, she tormented her body with sleeplessness, hunger, and~
other afflictions, but withal ever true to herself, stood forth a pattern of~
innocency, gentleness, and long-suffering. The salvation of her neighbours was~
her constant earnest endeavour, and her godly toil bore abundant fruit. The love~
of God oftentimes threw her into trances, and she was given the grace of the~
deepest contemplation, even to union of spirit with God.

[Lectio6]
Christ Himself, to show what such a bride was to Him, revealed that He had in~
the heart of Gertrude a pleasant dwelling-place. The Virgin Mother of God she~
ever sought with deep reverence as a mother and warden whom she had received~
from Jesus Himself, and from her she had many benefits. Toward the most Divine~
Sacrament of the Eucharist, and the sufferings of the Lord, her soul was moved~
with love and gratitude, so that she sometimes wept abundantly. She helped with~
daily gifts and prayers the souls of the just condemned to the purifying fire.~
She wrote much for the fostering of godliness. She was glorified also by~
revelations from God, and by the gift of prophecy. Her last illness was rather~
the wasting of a home - sickness to be with God than a decay of the flesh, and~
she left this life (to live the undying life in Him, upon the 17th day of~
November,) in the year of our Lord 1292. God made her bright with miracles~
both during her life and after her death.

[Lectio94]
Born at Eisleben in Saxony, Gertrud offered her virginity and herself to Jesus Christ in the Benedictine monastery of Rossdorf, when she was five. She had St Mechtilde for het teacher, and under this guidance atteined the highest gifts of contemplation. She burned wich such love for the most holy Sacrament of the Eucharist and the Passion of the Lord that when she thought of them she shed tears in profusion. She wrote many things to foster devotion, and was know for the gift of divine revelation and of prophecy. Finally, consumed more by her burning love of God than by sickness, she departed this life, famous for miracles both before and after her death.
