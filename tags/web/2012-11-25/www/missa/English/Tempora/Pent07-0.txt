[Lectio]
Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Romans
!Rom 6:19-23
Brethren: I speak in a human way because of the weakness of your flesh; for as you yielded your members as slaves of uncleanness and iniquity unto iniquity, so now yield your members as slaves of justice unto sanctification. For when you were slaves of sin, you were free as regards justice. But what fruit had you then from those things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of these things is death. But now set free from sin and become slaves to God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and as your end, life everlasting. For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is life everlasting in Christ Jesus our Lord.

[Graduale]
!Ps 33:12, 6.
Come, children, hear me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
V. Look to Him that you may be radiant with joy, and your faces may not blush~
with shame. Alleluia, alleluia.
!Ps 46:2
V. All you peoples, clap your hands, shout to God with cries of gladness.~
Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt. 7:15-21
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples: Beware of false prophets, who come to~
you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves. By their fruits you~
will know them. Do men gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles? Even so,~
every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree~
cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does~
not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Therefore, by their~
fruits you will know them. Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall~
enter the kingdom of heaven; but he who does the will of My Father in heaven~
shall enter the kingdom of heaven.

[Offertorium]
!Dan 3:40
As though it were holocausts of rams and bullocks, or thousands of fat lambs, so~
let our sacrifice be in Your presence today, that it may please You; for those~
who trust in You cannot be put to shame, O Lord.

[Secreta]
O God, You Who have given us in one perfect sacrifice the fulfillment of the~
various sacrifices made under the Old Law, accept these sacrificial gifts~
offered You by Your devoted servants, and make them holy as You did the gifts of~
Abel, so that what each one of us has offered in praise of Your majesty may~
profit for the salvation of all.

!Ps 30:3
Incline Your ear to me, make haste to deliver me.

lead us to do good.
