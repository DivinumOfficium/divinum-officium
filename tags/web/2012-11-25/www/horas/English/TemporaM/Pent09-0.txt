[Ant 1]
When the Lord would take up * Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, Elisha cried,~
and said: My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.

[Versum 1]
V. Let the evening prayer ascend unto thee, O Lord.
R. And let there descend upon us thy mercy.

[Oratio]
Let thy merciful ears, O Lord, be open to the prayers of thy humble servants;~
and, that they may obtain their petitions, make them to ask such things as shall~
please thee.

Lesson from the second book of Kings
!2 Kgs 1:1-4
1 And Moab rebelled against Israel, after the death of Achab.
2 And Ochozias fell through the lattices of his upper chamber which he had in~
Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, saying to them: Go, consult~
Beelzebub, the god of Accaron, whether I shall recover of this my illness.
3 And an angel of the Lord spoke to Elias the Thesbite, saying: Arise, and go up~
to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them: Is there not a~
God in Israel, that ye go to consult Beelzebub the god of Accaron?
4 Wherefore thus saith the Lord: From the bed, on which thou art gone up, thou~
shalt not come down, but thou shalt surely die. 

[Responsory1]
R. Prepare your hearts unto the Lord, and serve Him Only
* And He will deliver you out of the hand of your enemies.
V. Return unto Him with all your hearts, and put away the strange gods from~
among you.
R. And He will deliver you out of the hand of your enemies

[Lectio2]
!2 Kgs 1:4-6
4 And Elias went away.
5 And the messengers turned back to Ochozias. And he said to them: Why are you~
come back?
6 But they answered him: A man met us, and said to us: Go, and return to the~
king, that sent you, and you shall say to him: Thus saith the Lord: Is it~
because there was no God in Israel that thou sendest to Beelzebub the god of~
Accaron? Therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed, on which thou art gone~
up, but then shalt surely die

[Responsory2]
R. God, Which heareth all, even He sent His Angel, and took me from keeping my~
father's sheep, and
* Anointed me with the oil of His mercy.
V. The Lord That delivered me out of the mouth of the lion, and out of the paw~
of the bear
R. And anointed me with the oil of His mercy.

[Lectio3]
!2 Kgs 1:7-10
7 And he said to them: What manner of man was he who met you, and spoke these~
words?
8 But they said: A hairy man with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he~
said: It is Elias the Thesbite.
9 And he sent to him a captain of fifty, and the fifty men that were under him.~
And he went up to him, and as he was sitting on the top of a hill, said to him:~
Man of God, the king hath commanded that thou come down.
10 And Elias answering, said to the captain of fifty: If I be a man of God, let~
fire come down from heaven, and consume thee, and thy fifty. And there came down~
fire from heaven, and consumed him, and the fifty that were with him.

[Responsory3]
R. The Lord That delivered me out of the mouth of the lion, and out of the paw~

From the sermons of St Austin, Bishop of Hippo
!201st for the Season.
Dearly beloved brethren, in the Lessons which are now being read to us day by~
day, I have often warned you that we must not follow the deathful letter, to the~
abandonment of the quickening spirit. For it is thus that the Apostle saith:~
"The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life." (2 Cor. iii. 6.) If we will~
understand only the plain meaning of the letter, we shall get little or no~
edification from our readings in the Divine Scriptures. All those things whereof~
we hear were types and images of things

[Responsory4]
R. Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.
* Because the hand of the Lord was with him, he smote the Philistine, and took~
away the reproach from Israel.
V. Is not this David? Did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying~
Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
R. Because the hand of the Lord was with him, he smote the Philistine, and took~
away the reproach from Israel.

[Lectio5]
The Blessed Elias was a type of the Lord our Saviour. Just as Elias was rejected~
by the Jews, so was the true Elias, even our Lord, rejected and despised by the~
same Jews. Elias went away out of his own country, and Christ hath left the~
synagogue Elias went into the desert, and Christ hath come into the world. Elias,~
when he was in the desert, was fed by ravens, and Christ in the desert of this~
world is comforted by the faith of the Gentiles.

[Responsory5]
R. Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain upon~
you
* For there are the mighty of Israel fallen
V. All ye mountains that stand round about, the Lord look upon you but let Him~
pass by Gilboa
R. For there are the mighty of Israel fallen

[Lectio6]
For the ravens which, at the command of the Lord, ministered unto Elias, were a~
type of the flock of Gentiles. Wherefore also it is said for the Gentile Church:~
"I am black, but comely O daughters of Jerusalem!" (Cant. i. 4.) Why is the~
Church black but comely She is black by nature, but comely by grace. Why is~
she black by nature? Because she must needs own: "Behold, I was shapen in~
iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me." (Ps. 1. 7.) Why is she comely~
by? Sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be clean wash me, and I shall be~
whiter than snow,

[Responsory6]
R. Thus saith the Lord I took thee out of thy father's house, and appointed~
thee to be ruler over My people, over Israel.
* And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, to establish thy kingdom for~
ever.
V. And I have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that~
are in the earth and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies.
R. And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, to establish thy kingdom for~
ever.
&Gloria
R. And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, to establish thy kingdom for~
ever.

From the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 19:41-17
At that time When Jesus was come near to Jerusalem, He beheld the city, and~
wept over it, saying If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day,~
the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.~
And so on.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory the Great.
!39 on the Gospels.
No man that hath read the history of the destruction of Jerusalem by the Roman~
Princes Vespasian and Titus, can be ignorant that it was of that destruction~
that the Lord spoke when He wept over the ruin of the city. It is these Princes~
that are pointed at where it is said " For the days shall come upon thee that~
thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee." The truth of what followeth "~
They shall not leave in thee one stone upon another "  is even now fulfilled~
in the change of site of the city, which hath been re-built round about that~
place without the gates, where the Lord was crucified, while the ancient city~
hath been, as I am told, rooted up from the very foundations

[Responsory7]
@TemporaM/Pent01-3:Responsory1

[Lectio8]
What the sin of Jerusalem was which brought upon her the punishment of this~
destruction, we find written after " Because thou knewest not the time of thy~
visitation." The Maker of men, through the mystery of His Incarnation, was~
pleased to visit her, but she remembered not to fear and to love Him. Hence also~
the Prophet Jeremiah, rebuking the hardness of man's heart, calleth the birds of~
the air to testify against it, saying "The stork in the heaven knoweth her~
appointed time and the turtle, and the swallow, and the crane, observe the~
time of their coming but my people know not the judgment of the Lord." (viii.~
7.)

[Lectio9]
The Saviour wept over the ruin of the unfaithful city, while she herself as yet~
knew not that it was coming. If thou hadst known, said He, even thou and we may~
understand Him to have meant thou wouldest thyself have wept, in place of making~
merry as thou now dost, knowing not what hangeth over thee. And hence He saith~
farther: "at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace."~
While she was giving herself up to fleshly pleasures, and casting no look ahead~
upon coming sorrows, she had still for a day in her power the things which might~
have brought unto her peace.

@TemporaM/Pent03-0:Responsory9

[Ant 2]
When the Lord was come near to Jerusalem, He beheld the city, and wept * over it,~
saying If thou hadst known, even thou! For the days shall come upon thee, that~
thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep~
thee in on every side and shall lay thee even with the ground because thou~
knewest not the time of thy visitation. Alleluia.

[Versum 2]
V. The Lord reigneth He is clothed with majesty.
R. The Lord is clothed with strength, and hath girded Himself with power.

[Ant 3]
It is written My house is the house of prayer * for all nations but ye have~
made it a den of thieves. And He taught daily in the Temple.

[Versum 3]
V. Let my prayer, O Lord, be set forth.
R. As incense before thee.

[LectioE]
Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 19:41-17
19:41 And when he drew near, seeing the city, he wept over it, saying:
19:42 If thou also hadst known, and that in this thy day, the things that are to thy peace; but now they are hidden from thy eyes.
19:43 For the days shall come upon thee, and thy enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and straiten thee on every side,
19:44 And beat thee flat to the ground, and thy children who are in thee: and they shall not leave in thee a stone upon a stone: because thou hast not known the time of thy visitation.
19:45 And entering into the temple, he began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought.
19:46 Saying to them: It is written: My house is the house of prayer. But you have made it a den of thieves.
19:47 And he was teaching daily in the temple. And the chief priests and the scribes and the rulers of the people sought to destroy him:
19:48 And they found not what to do to him: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.
