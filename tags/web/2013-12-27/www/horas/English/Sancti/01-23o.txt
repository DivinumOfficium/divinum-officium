[Oratio]
O Lord, we pray thee that thy blessed handmaiden and witness Emerentiana in whom Thou hast ever been well pleased, because of her worthy maidenhood and her mighty showing-forth of thy power, may entreat thy pardon on our behalf.
$Per Dominum

[Lectio93]
Emerentiana was a Roman maiden, and the foster-sister of the blessed Agnes.~
While she was still a Catechumen she was inspired by her faith and love to~
rebuke the fury of the idol-worshippers against the Christians, whereupon a mob~
assembled, and stoned her so severely that she was only able to drag herself to~
the grave of holy Agnes, where, while she prayed, she gave up her soul to God,~
being baptized, not in water, but in her own blood, so freely shed for Christ.
