Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 14:15-21
At that time Jesus said unto His disciples If ye love Me, keep My~
commandments. And I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another~
Comforter. And so on.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop of Hippo.
!74th and 75th Tracts on John.
By these words of the Lord " I will pray the Father, and He shall give you~
another Comforter" He doth imply that Himself is a Com- forter. The Greek word~
used, namely " Parakletos," signifieth also an Advocate, and is used in that~
sense where it is written "We have an Advocate Parakleton with the Father,~
Jesus Christ the Righteous." "Even the Spirit of truth, Whom the world cannot~
receive," "because,": as we read elsewhere "the carnal mind is enmity against;~
God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be" as we~
may say plainly nothing can make unrighteousness righteous. By "the world," in~
this place, we must understand the lovers of the world, a love which cometh not~
of the Father. And therefore it is that this love of the world, which we strive~
to lessen and to destroy in ourselves, is contrary to " the love of God, which~
is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy I Ghost which is given unto us."

"The Spirit of truth; Whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth Him not,~
neither knoweth Him " for to love the world is to lack those spiritual eyes,~
which are able to see Him Who is invisible, the Holy Ghost. " But ye know Him,"~
saith the Lord to His disciples, " for He shall dwell with you, and shall be in~
you." He will be in them to dwell in them, not dwell in them to be in them for~
one must first be in a place before one dwell there. But lest the Apostles~
should think that the words, "He shall dwell with you," signified that He should~
visibly abide with them for a while, as do guests in the houses of men, the Lord~
saith in explanation "He shall be in you."

[Lectio3]
Therefore is He seen That is invisible. If He were not in us we could have in us~
no knowledge of Him but He is seen in us, as we see our conscience. We see the~
faces of other men, but we cannot see our Own but of consciences we see none~
save that within ourselves. But our conscience is never elsewhere but within us~
whereas the Holy Ghost may be without us, as well as within us. He is given to~
be within us, and, unless He be within us, we can neither see nor know Him,~
either within or without us. Then, after that He had promised the Holy Ghost,~
the Lord, lest they should deem that He was to give them that other Comforter~
instead of Himself, and that He Himself was to be no longer with them, said also "I~
will not leave you orphans I will come to you." Therefore, although the Son of~
God hath made us by adoption sons of His Own Father, and hath willed that the~
Same Who is His Father by nature should be our Father by grace, nevertheless, He~
showeth that Himself hath toward us a love as of a Father, where He saith "I~
will not leave you orphans."

!John 14:15-21
14:15 If you love me, keep my commandments.
14:16 And I will ask the Father, and he shall give you another Paraclete, that he may abide with you for ever.
14:17 The spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, nor knoweth him: but you shall know him; because he shall abide with you, and shall be in you.
14:18 I will not leave you orphans, I will come to you.
14:19 Yet a little while: and the world seeth me no more. But you see me: because I live, and you shall live.
14:20 In that day you shall know, that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.
14:21 He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them; he it is that loveth me. And he that loveth me, shall be loved of my Father: and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.
