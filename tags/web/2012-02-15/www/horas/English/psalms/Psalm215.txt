(Canticum Isaiae Isa 45:15-26)
15 Verily thou art a hidden God, the God of Israel the saviour.
16 They are all confounded and ashamed: the forgers of errors are gone together into confusion. 
17 Israel is saved in the Lord with as eternal salvation: you shall not be confounded, and you shall not be ashamed for ever and ever. 
18 For thus saith the Lord that created the heavens, God himself that formed the earth, and made it, the very maker thereof: he did not create it in vain: he formed it to be inhabited. I am the Lord, and there is no other. 
19 I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I have not said to the seed of Jacob: Seek me in vain. I am the Lord that speak justice, that declare right things. 
20 Assemble yourselves, and come, and draw near together, ye that are saved of the Gentiles: they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven work, and pray to a god that cannot save.
21 Tell ye, and come, and consult together: who hath declared this from the beginning, who hath foretold this from that time? Have not I the Lord, and there is no God else besides me? A just God and a saviour, there is none besides me. 
22 Be converted to me, and you shall be saved, all ye ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is no other. 
23 I have sworn by myself, the word of justice shall go out of my mouth, and shall not return: 
24 For every knee shall be bowed to me, and every tongue shall swear. 
25 Therefore shall he say: In the Lord are my justices and empire: they shall come to him, and all that resist him shall be confounded.
26 In the Lord shall all the seed of Israel be justified and praised.
