[Lectio1]
Lesson from the book of Job
!Job 31:1-6
1  I made a covenant with my eyes, that I would not so much as think upon a virgin.
2  For what part should God from above have in me, and what inheritance the Almighty from on high?
3  Is not destruction to the wicked, and aversion to them that work iniquity?
4  Doth not he consider my ways, and number all my steps?
5  If I have walked in vanity, and my foot hath made haste to deceit:
6  Let him weigh me in a just balance, and let God know my simplicity.

!Job 31:7-12
7  If my step hath turned out of the way, and if my heart hath followed my eyes, and if a spot hath cleaved to my hands:
8  Then let me sow and let another eat: and let my offspring be rooted out.
9  If my heart hath been deceived upon a woman, and if I have laid wait at my friend's door:
10  Let my wife be the harlot of another, and let other men lie with her.
11  For this is a heinous crime, and a most grievous iniquity.
12  It is a fire that devoureth even to destruction, and rooteth up all things that spring.

!Job 31:13-18
13  If I have despised to abide judgment with my manservant, or my maidservant, when they had any controversy against me:
14  For what shall I do when God shall rise to judge? and when he shall examine, what shall I answer him?
15  Did not he that made me in the womb make him also: and did not one and the same form me in the womb?
16  If I have denied to the poor what they desired, and have made the eyes of the widow wait:
17  If I have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof:
18  (For from my infancy mercy grew up with me: and it came out with me from my mother's womb)
