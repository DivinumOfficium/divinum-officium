Lesson from the second book of Kings
!2 Kgs 2:5-7
5 The sons of the prophets that were at Jericho, came to Eliseus, and said to~
him: Dost thou know that this day the Lord will take away thy master from thee?~
And he said: I also know it: hold your peace.
6 And Elias said to him: Stay here, because the Lord hath sent me as far as the~
Jordan. And he said: As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not~
leave thee; and they two went on together,
7 And fifty men of the sons of the prophets followed them, and stood in sight at a~
distance: but they two stood by the Jordan.

!2 Kgs 2:8-10
8 And Elias took his mantle and folded it together, and struck the waters, and~
they were divided hither and thither, and they both passed over on dry ground.
9 And when they were gone over, Elias said to Eliseus: Ask what thou wilt have~
me to do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Eliseus said: I beseech~
thee that in me may be thy double spirit.
10 And he answered: Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless if thou see me~
when I am taken from thee, thou shalt have what thou hast asked: but if thou see~
me not, thou shalt not have it.

11 And as they went on, walking and talking together, behold a fiery chariot,~
and fiery horses parted them both asunder: and Elias went up by a whirlwind into~
heaven.
12 And Eliseus saw him, and cried: My father, my father, the chariot of Israel,~
and the driver thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own~
garments, and rent them in two pieces.
13 And he took up the mantle of Elias, that fell from him: and going back, he~
stood upon the bank of the Jordan,
