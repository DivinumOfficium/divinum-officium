!Pro Urbano I Martyri
Commemoratio for St Urban, Bishop and Martyr.) This Urban was a Roman, who, in~
the reign of the Emperor Alexander Severus, by his teaching and holy life,~
brought many to believe in Christ. Among others was Valerian, the husband of the~
blessed Cecily, and Tiburtius, the brother of Valerian, both of whom afterwards~
bravely underwent martyrdom. It was Urban l who wrote the following words~
concerning the property of the Church : Those things which His faithful ones~
make offering of unto the Lord, must never be turned to any other use than those~
of the Church, or of our Christian brethren, or of the poor. They are the~
free-will offerings of faithful believers, the trespass offerings of sinners,~
and the inheritance of the poor. He sat in the chair of Peter six years, seven~
months, and four days, and being crowned with martyrdom, was buried in the~
cemetery of Praetextatus, on the 25th day of May. He held five ordinations in~
December, wherein he ordained nine Priests, five Deacons, and eight Bishops for~
divers places.
