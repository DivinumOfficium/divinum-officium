Lesson from the book of Isaias
!Isa 66:12-14
Thus says the Lord: Lo, I will spread prosperity over her like a river, and the wealth of the nations like an overflowing torrent. As nurslings, you shall be carried in her arms, and fondled in her lap; as a mother comforts her son, so will I comfort you; in Jerusalem you shall find your comfort. When you see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bodies flourish like the grass; the Lord’s power shall be known to His servants.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 18:1-4
 At that time, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is greater in the~
kingdom of heaven? And Jesus called a little child to Him, set him in their~
midst, and said, Amen I say to you, unless you turn and become like little~
children, you will not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whoever, therefore,~
humbles himself as this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of~
heaven.

[Offertorium]
!Luke 1:46; 1:48-49.
My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; because He~
has regarded the lowliness of His handmaid. He Who is mighty has done great~
things for me.

[Secreta]
We beseech You, O Lord, may the holy prayers of blessed Theresa, Your Virgin,~
commend our sacrifice to You, so that it may be made acceptable by her merits in~
whose honor it is solemnly offered.

[Communio]
!Deut 32:10-12
He led her about and taught her, and He guarded her as the apple of His eye. As~
an eagle He spread His wings to receive her and bore her up on His pinions. The~
Lord alone was her leader.

[Postcommunio]
May the heavenly sacrament, O Lord, enkindle in us that fire of love which urged~
blessed Theresa, Your Virgin, to offer herself to You as a victim of charity for~
mankind.
