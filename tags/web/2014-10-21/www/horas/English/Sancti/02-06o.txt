[Oratio]
O Lord, we pray thee that thy blessed handmaiden and witness Dorothy in whom~
Thou hast ever been well pleased, because of her worthy maidenhood and her~
mighty showing-forth of thy power, may entreat thy pardon on our behalf.

[Lectio93]
The maiden Dorothy, of Caesarea in Cappadocia, was betrayed to Apricius the~
President by her two sisters, Chrysta and Callista, who had denied the faith, in~
the hope that he would induce her to do likewise. She was arrested, but it came~
not to pass as they hoped. On the contrary, she brought them back to the~
Christian worship, and they received martyrdom. She was long tormented upon the~
rack, and scourged with palmbranches, and in the end was beheaded, receiving the~
double palm of virginity and martyrdom.
