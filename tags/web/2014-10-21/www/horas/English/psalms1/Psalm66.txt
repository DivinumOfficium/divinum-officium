66:1 May God have mercy on us, and bless us: * may he cause the light of his countenance to shine upon us, and may he have mercy on us.
66:2 That we may know thy way upon earth: * thy salvation in all nations.
66:3 Let people confess to thee, O God: * let all people give praise to thee. 
66:4 Let the nations be glad and rejoice: * for thou judgest the people with justice, and directest the nations upon earth. 
66:5 Let the people, O God, confess to thee: * let all the people give praise to thee: the earth hath yielded her fruit.
66:6 May God, our God bless us, may God bless us: * and all the ends of the earth fear him.
