75:1 In Judea God is known: * his name is great in Israel.
75:2 And his place is in peace: * and his abode in Sion:
75:3 There hath he broken the powers of bows, * the shield, the sword, and the battle.
75:4 Thou enlightenest wonderfully from the everlasting hills. * All the foolish of heart were troubled.
75:5 They have slept their sleep; * and all the men of riches have found nothing in their hands.
75:6 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, * they have all slumbered that mounted on horseback.
75:8 Thou art terrible, and who shall resist thee? * from that time thy wrath.
75:9 Thou hast caused judgment to be heard from heaven: * the earth trembled and was still,
75:10 When God arose in judgment, * to save all the meek of the earth.
75:11 For the thought of man shall give praise to thee: * and the remainders of the thought shall keep holiday to thee.
75:12 Vow ye, and pay to the Lord your God: * all you that are round about him bring presents.
75:13 To him that is terrible, even to him who taketh away the spirit of princes: * to the terrible with the kings of the earth.
