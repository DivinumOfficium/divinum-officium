01-19# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 4: What Are the Instruments of Good Works. Continued.
_
Not to carry anger into effect.
Not to prolong the duration of one’s wrath.
Not to retain guile in one’s heart.
Not to make a false peace.
Not to abandon charity.
Not to swear, lest perchance one forswear.
To utter only truth from heart and mouth.
Not to return evil for evil.
Not to do injury, but to suffer it patiently.
To love enemies.
Not to curse in return those who curse one, but rather to bless them.
To bear persecution for righteousness.
Not to be proud.
Not to be given to much wine.
Not to be gluttonous.
Not given to much sleep.
Not to be sluggish.
Not to be given to grumbling.
Not to be a detractor.
To put one’s hope in God.
When one sees any good in oneself to attribute it to God, not to self.
But to recognize that evil always comes from self and to refer it to self.
