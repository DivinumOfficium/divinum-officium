O God, who year by year dost gladden us by the solemn feast day of thy Blessed~
Anacletus Martyr and Pontifex, mercifully grant that we who keep his birthday, may~
ever feel the joyful effects of his protection.

[Lectio4]
Anacletus was an Athenian who governed the Church in the time of the Emperor~
Trajan. He ordained that a Bishop should be consecrated by three Bishops and no~
less, that clerks should be publicly ordained to Holy Orders by their own Bishop,~
and that in the Mass, after the Consecration, all should afterwards Communicate.~
He adorned the grave of Blessed Peter, and ordered a place for burying the Popes~
in. He held two ordinations in the month of December, wherein he ordained five~
Priests, three Deacons, and six Bishops. He sat as Pope nine years, three months,~
and ten days. He received the crown of his testimony, and was buried on the~
Vatican Hill.

[Lectio5]
From the Exposition of the hundred-and-eighteenth Psalm by St Ambrose, Bishop~
of Milan.
!21st Sermon.
Princes have persecuted me I without a cause; but my heart standeth in awe of~
thy word. These are rightly the words of a martyr, who beareth unjustly the~
torments of the persecutors, who hath robbed no man, who hath violently~
oppressed no man, who hath shed the blood of no man, who hath imagined to defile~
the bed of no man, who is debtor to the laws in nothing, and who is punished~
more grievously than if he were a robber: who speaketh righteousness, and there~
is none that will hear: who speaketh salvation, and all men fight against him:~
who is able to say: “When I spoke unto them, they fought against me without a~
cause.” (Ps. cxix. 7.) They fight against him without a cause, who can lay no~
sin to his charge; they fight against him as an evildoer, who is by their own~
acknowledgment righteous: they fight against him as a warlock, who glorieth in~
the name of the Lord, and who doeth all things well because he doeth all things~
for God's sake.

[Lectio6]
They fight against him in vain who is accused of ungodliness among the ungodly~
and the unfaithful, because he teacheth Faith. Verily, him that is fought~
against without a cause it behoveth to be strong and patient. Wherefore then~
saith he: My heart standeth in awe of thy word? Awe is the mark of the weak,~
the timid, and the fearful But there is also a weakness unto salvation, there is a~
fear which is an holy fear. 0 fear the Lord, all ye His Saints. (Ps. xxxiii.~
10.) And again: Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord. (Ps. cxi. i.) And~
wherefore is he blessed? because he delighteth greatly in His commandments.
