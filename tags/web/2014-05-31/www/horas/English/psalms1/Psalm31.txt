31:1 Blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven * and whose sins are covered.
31:2 Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed sin, * and in whose spirit there is no guile.
31:2 Because I was silent my bones grew old; * whilst I cried out all the day long.
31:4 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: * I am turned in my anguish, whilst the thorn is fastened.
31:5 I have acknowledged my sin to thee, * and my injustice I have not concealed.
31:6 I said I will confess against myself my injustice to the Lord: * and thou hast forgiven the wickedness of my sin.
31:7 For this shall every one that is holy pray to thee * in a seasonable time.
31:8 And yet in a flood of many waters, * they shall not come nigh unto him.
31:9 Thou art my refuge from the trouble which hath encompassed me: * my joy, deliver me from them that surround me.
31:10 I will give thee understanding, and I will instruct thee in this way, in which thou shalt go: * I will fix my eyes upon thee.
31:12 Do not become like the horse and the mule, * who have no understanding.
31:13 With bit and bridle bind fast their jaws, * who come not near unto thee.
31:13 Many are the scourges of the sinner, * but mercy shall encompass him that hopeth in the Lord.
31:14 Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye just, * and glory, all ye right of heart.
