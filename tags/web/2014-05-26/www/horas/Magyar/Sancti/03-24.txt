When Zacharias went into the temple of the Lord, * there appeared unto him the Angel Gabriel, standing on the right side of the Altar of incense. (Alleluia.)

I am the Angel Gabriel, * that stand in the presence of God, and am sent to speak unto thee. (Alleluia.)
The Angel Gabriel spake unto Mary * and said : Behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a Son, and shalt call His Name Jesus. (Alleluia.)
Then said Mary unto the Angel : How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? * And the Angel Gabriel answered and said unto her: The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee. (Alleluia.)

[Hymnus Vespera]
v. Christ, of the angels praise and adoration,
Father and Saviour thou, of every nation,
Graciously grant us all to gain a station,
Where thou art reigning.
_
Angel of strength, who triumphed, tumults quelling,
Gabriel send us, ancient foes expelling,
Oft in these temples may he make his dwelling,
Dear unto heaven.
_
May the fair Mother of the Light be o'er us,
Virgin of peace, with all the angel chorus,
And may the heavenly army go before us,
Guiding and guarding.
_
O may the Godhead, endless bliss possessing,
Father, Son, Spirit, grant to us this blessing;
All his creation joins his praise confessing,
Now and forever.
Ámen.

!Dan 9:20-23
20 Egyre beszéltem: imádkoztam, megvallottam bûneimet és népemnek, Izraelnek~
bûneit, s az Úr, a mi Istenünk elé terjesztettem könyörgésemet Istenünk szent~
hegyéért.
21 Még mondtam az imádságot, amikor Gábriel, az a férfiú, akit már láttam az~
elõbbi látomásomban, hirtelenül leszállt hozzám az esti áldozat idején.
22 Megszólított és azt mondta: "Máris eljöttem, hogy felvilágosítást adjak.
23 Amikor imádkozni kezdtél, egy szózat hallatszott. Eljöttem, hogy tudtodra~
adjam, mert kedvelt férfiú vagy. Figyelj hát a szózatra, és értsd meg a~

!Dan 9:26-27

[Lectio4]
From the Sermons of St Bernard, Abbat (of Clairvaux.)
!On Luke i. 26.
The Angel Gabriel was sent from God.I opine that this Angel is not one of those~
lesser ones who are often sent to earth with messages upon one occasion and~
another. This may well be understood from his name, which signifieth the strong~
-man -of- God, and because it is especially said that he was sent, not by some~
spirit haply more excellent than he, but from God Himself. It is said from God~
lest it should be imagined that God had revealed His counsel to any of the~
blessed spirits before revealing it to the Virgin, except to the Archangel~
Gabriel, who is thus discovered to possess such an excellency in the heavenly~
host as becomes at once his name and his message.

[Responsory4]
R. It came to pass that while Zacharias executed the Priest's office before God,~
in the order of his course
* There appeared unto him the Angel Gabriel, standing on the right side of the~
Altar of incense. (Alleluia.)
V. When he went into the temple of the Lord to burn incense, according to the~
custom of the Priest's office.
R. There appeared unto him the Angel Gabriel, standing on the right side of the~
Altar of incense. (Alleluia.)

[Lectio5]
Either do his name and his message disagree, for whom did it more beseem to be~
the herald of Christ, the Power of God, (i Cor. i. 24,) than him who was~
honoured by bearing a like name? For power and strength are much the same.~
Neither doth it appear unmeet or unseemly that the Lord and His messenger should~
have a like title, when we consider that that title differeth in meaning in~
each. Christ is called the Power or Strength of God in a sense very different to~
that in which the like appellation is given to the Angel. In the Angel it is a~
bestowed title; in Christ, an essential description.

[Responsory5]
R. The Angel Gabriel came down unto Zacharias, and said unto him :
* Fear not; for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a~
son, and thou shalt call his name John. (Alleluia.)
V. And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him; but the~
Angel said unto him
R. Fear not; for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a~
son, and thou shalt call his name John. (Alleluia.)

[Lectio6]
Christ is called, and absolutely the Power of God. When the strong man armed~
kept his palace, and all his goods were in peace, Christ came upon him as One~
stronger than he, and overcame him by the strength of His Own arm, and took from~
him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divided his spoils. (Luke xi. 21,~
22.) But the Angel is called the strongman-of-God, either because this title was~
his right as the herald of the Power of God, or because it was his mission to~
comfort the Virgin, naturally fearful, simple, and shame-faced, lest she should~
be beside herself with terror at the newness of the miracle, which office indeed~
he discharged when he said: Fear not, Mary; for thou hast found grace with God.~
Meetly therefore was Gabriel chosen for this work, or rather, meetly was his~
name given him since he had been so chosen.

[Responsory6]
R. I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto~
thee, and to show thee these glad tidings.
* Behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these~
things shall be performed. (Alleluia.)
V. Because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their~
season.
R. Behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these~
things shall be performed. (Alleluia.)
&Gloria
R. Behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these~
things shall be performed. (Alleluia.)

Evangélium szent Lukács Evangélista kõnyvébõl
!Luke 1:26-38
At that time : The Angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named~
Nazareth, to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of~
David : and the Virgin's name was Mary. And so on.
_
Homily by St Julian, Archbishop of Toledo.
!2nd against the Jews.
It was from an Angel that Daniel learnt the secret of the seventy weeks until~
the birth of the Christ; it was by the apparition of an Angel that Zacharias~
heard that he was about to beget a son; and it was when an Angel foretold that~
the Christ should be born of her, that Mary believed and consented. These three~
things we see announced by an Angel, and fulfilled. Let us now then look~
carefully whether the Angel who appeared to Zacharias and Mary was the same who~
had foretold these same things to Daniel.

[Responsory7]
R. The Angel Gabriel was sent to Mary, the virgin espoused to Joseph, and the~
Virgin was afraid of the light.
* Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found grace with the Lord. Behold, thou shalt~
conceive and bring forth a Son, and He shall be called the Son of the Highest.~
~(Alleluia.)
V. And when she heard it, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind~
what manner of salutation this should be. And the Angel said unto her :
R. Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found grace with the Lord. Behold, thou shalt~
conceive, and bring forth a Son, and He shall be called the Son of the Highest.~
~(Alleluia.)

[Lectio8]
As for Daniel, he, in the Book of his Prophecy, when he learnt from the Angel~
the mystery of the seventy weeks, which should mark the date of the Birth of~
Christ, plainly expresseth the name of the said Angel. For he saith : Behold,~
the man Gabriel, whom I had seen (in the vision) at the beginning, being caused~
to fly swiftly, touched me (about the time of the evening oblation; and he~
informed me, and talked with me,) and said : O Daniel, (I am now come forth to~
give thee skill and understanding. At the beginning of thy supplications the~
commandment came forth, and I am come to show thee, for thou art greatly beloved;~
therefore) consider the matter, and so on, as is there narrated. And so, when~
the time pointed at drew near, we find in the Gospel the wondrous name of this~
same Angel. For the Angel said unto Zacharias : I am Gabriel, that stand in the~
presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to show thee these glad~
tidings. 

[Lectio9]
And this is also the name which we read in the Gospel~
where the child-bearing of the BlessedVirgin Mary is spoken of, as it is written :~
The Angel Gabriel was sent from God, unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, to a~
virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the~
virgin's name was Mary. We see then that it was the one and the same Angel~
Gabriel who revealed to Daniel the time prefixed for the Birth of Christ, and~
who announced the delivery of the Virgin when the time came. He cometh at the~
very time which he himself had foretold, and showeth by actual demonstration the~
fulfilment of his former word, faithful in the prophecy of the weeks, faithful~
in the revelation of the mystery.

[Responsory8]
R. Rejoice, O Mary, by whose mighty hand the Church hath victory over her foes~
achieved
* Since thou to Gabriel's word of quickening power in lowliness hast listened~
and believed thou, still a virgin, in thy blessed womb hast God Incarnate of thy~
flesh conceived, and, still of heaven, of that virginity remainest after~
childbirth unbereaved. (Alleluia.)
V. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.
R. Since thou to Gabriel's word of quickening power in lowliness hast listened~
and believed thou, still a virgin, in thy blessed womb hast God Incarnate of thy~
flesh conceived, and, still of heaven, of that virginity remainest after~
childbirth unbereaved. (Alleluia.)
&Gloria
R. Since thou to Gabriel's word of quickening power in lowliness hast listened~

To all the weak new strength impart,
And solace to the sad of heart.

May those glad hosts which see Thy Face,
The spirits of the heavenly home,
Away from us all evils chase,
Both past, and present, and to come.

Then purge away all unbelief,
From every land where Christians dwell,

Our thanks and praises we may tell.
