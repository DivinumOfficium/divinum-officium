From the letter of St Paul to the Galatians
!Gal 5:1-5
1 Stand fast, and be not held again under the yoke of bondage.
2 Behold, I Paul tell you, that if you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.
3 And I testify again to every man circumcising himself, that he is a debtor to the whole law.
4 You are made void of Christ, you who are justified in the law: you are fallen from grace.
5 For we in spirit, by faith, wait for the hope of justice.

!Gal 5:6-10
6 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision: but faith that worketh by charity.
7 You did run well, who hath hindered you, that you should not obey the truth?
8 This persuasion is not from him that calleth you.
9 A little leaven corrupteth the whole lump.
10 I have confidence in you in the Lord: that you will not be of another mind: but he that troubleth you, shall bear the judgment, whosoever he be.

!Gal 5:11-17
11 And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? Then is the scandal of the cross made void.
12 I would they were even cut off, who trouble you.
13 For you, brethren, have been called unto liberty: only make not liberty an occasion to the flesh, but by charity of the spirit serve one another.
14 For all the law is fulfilled in one word: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
15 But if you bite and devour one another; take heed you be not consumed one of another.
16 I say then, walk in the spirit, and you shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh.
17 For the flesh lusteth against the spirit: and the spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary one to another: so that you do not the things that you would.
