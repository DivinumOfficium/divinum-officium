O God, Who by the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin, prepared a worthy~
dwelling for Your Son, and Who, by Your Son’s death, foreseen by You, preserved~
her from all taint, grant, we beseech You, through her intercession, that we too~
may come to You unstained by sin.

Lesson from the book of Proverbs
!Prov 8:22-35
The Lord begot me, the firstborn of His ways, the forerunner of His prodigies of long ago; from of old I was poured forth, at the first, before the earth. When there were no depths I was brought forth, when there were no fountains or springs of water; before the mountains were settled into place, before the hills, I was brought forth; while as yet the earth and the fields were not made, nor the first clods of the world. When He established the heavens I was there, when He marked out the vault over the face of the deep; when He made firm the skies above, and poised the fountains of waters; when He set for the sea its limit, so that the waters should not transgress His command; when He fixed fast the foundations of the earth; then was I beside Him as His craftsman, and I was His delight day by day, playing before Him all the while, playing on the surface of His earth and I found delight in the sons of men. So now, O children, listen to me; happy those who keep my ways. Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not. Happy the man who obeys me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at my doorsteps, for he who finds me finds life, and wins favor from the Lord.

Accept, O Lord, the sacrifice of salvation which we offer You on the feast of~

through her intercession, may we be freed from all sin.
