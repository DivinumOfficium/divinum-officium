O God, Who didst make blessed Vincent strong with the strength of an Apostle, to~
preach the Gospel to the poor, and to adorn the clergy of thy Church, grant, we~
beseech thee, that we who worshipfully recall his godly and worthy conversation,~
may also order our own goings upon the mighty example of his good life.

Vincent de Paul was a Frenchman by nation, and was born at (Ranquines, in the~
parish of) Pouy, not far from Dax in Gascony, (upon the 24th day of April, in~
the year of salvation 1576.) From a little child he showed remarkable charity~
towards the poor. His father removed him from keeping his cattle, in order to~
give him a school education, and he learnt earthly things at Dax, and theology~
both at Toulouse and at Saragossa. He took Priest's orders, and a degree in~
Divinity. (In 1605,) he was taken prisoner by Mahommedan pirates, who carried~
him off, and sold him for a slave in Africa. In his slavery he converted his~
owner, who was an apostate, back to Christ. Under the protection of the Mother~
of God, Vincent escaped from Barbary. He first visited the thresholds of the~
Apostles, and afterwards returned to France. He was the saintly Rector first of~
the Parish of Clichi, and afterwards of that of Chatillon. He was appointed by~
the King, ChaplainGeneral for the galleys of France, and worked with~
extraordinary zeal for the health of the souls both of those who commanded and~
of the convicts who rowed. He was made Superior of the Nuns of the Visitation by~
St Francis de Sales, and discharged this duty for about forty years, with a~
wisdom which so approved itself to the judgment of their holy Founder, that he~
was used to say he knew no worthier Priest than Vincent.

The preaching of the Gospel to the poor, especially peasants, was the work at~
which he toiled unweariedly, till he was disabled by age. To this special work~
he bound himself and the members of the Congregation which he founded under the~
missionary Congregation of Secular Priests, by a perpetual vow approved by the~
Holy See. How great were his labours for bettering the discipline of the clergy,~
is attested by the building of Seminaries for the final education of young~
clerks, the number of meetings of Priests to discuss holy things, and the~
religious exercises preparatory to Ordination, for which, as well as for godly~
retreats by laymen, he wished that the houses belonging to his Institute should~
be always freely open. To spread wider the growth of faith and godliness, he~
sent his Gospel labourers not only into the several provinces of France, but~
also into Italy, Poland, Scotland, and Ireland, and also to Barbary and India.~
He assisted Lewis XIII. on his death-bed, and the Queen Anne of Austria, mother~
of Lewis XIV., put him upon the young King's Council of Conscience during the~
Regency, in which position it was his unceasing effort that none but the most~
worthy should be named to churches and monasteries, that civil contests, duels,~
and creeping false doctrines, from which himself shrank as soon as he met them,~
should be put down, and that all men should yield the obedience which was due to~
the decisions of the Apostolic See.

There was no kind of misery which he did not strive with fatherly tenderness to~
relieve. Christians groaning in Mahommedan slavery, foundlings, deformed~
children, young maidens exposed to danger, houseless nuns, fallen women,~
convicts sent to the galleys, sick foreigners, disabled workmen, lunatics, and~
beggars without number, all these he relieved, and devoutly housed in divers~
charitable institutions which remain to this day. When Lorraine, Champagne,~
Picardy, and other districts were desolated by plague, famine, and war, he made~
immense efforts for their relief. He founded many charitable societies, to find~
out and succour the unfortunate. Among these are remarkable that of Matrons, and~
that of Sisters of Charity which hath been so widely spread. By those of the~
Cross, of Providence, and of St Guinevere he aimed at bringing up young girls as~
school - mistresses. Amid all these and other most anxious business-matters, he~
remained always looking simply to God, kind to all, true to himself, plain,~
upright, and lowly. From all honours, riches, and pleasures, he ever shrank, and~
was heard to say, that nothing gave him any pleasure, except in Christ Jesus,~
Whom it was his wish in all things to follow. With a body worn out with~
hardships, work, and old age, he gently fell asleep in the house of St Lazarus~
at Paris, the chief house of the Congregation of the Missions, upon the 27th day~
of September, in the year of salvation 1660, and of his own age the 85th. He was~
famous on account of his life, his works, and his miracles, and Clement XII.~
inscribed his name among those of the saints, appointing for his Feastday the~
19th day of the month of July. Finally, at the earnest prayer of many prelates,~
Leo XIII. proclaimed and established this hero of charity, illustrious for his~
services to all classes of men, as the patron before God in heaven of all~
charitable societies throughout the whole Catholic world which derive their~
origin in any way from his institution.

From his very boyhood, Vincent de Paul, born at Pouy in Gascony, was remarkable for his great charity toward the poor. Called from the care of his father's flock to the study of letters and then ordained to the priesthood, he fell into the hands of the Turks, who took him captive into Africa. With his master, an apostate whom he had won back to the faith of Christ, he escaped and went back to France. In the parishes entrusted to him and then as chaplain of the galleys, he zealously undertook the work of the salvation of souls. As diréctor of the Visitation nuns for about forty years, he governed them most wisely. Even in his old age, he worked untiringly for the evangelization of the poor, especially of those who lived in the country. He had founded a Congregation under the name of the Secular Priests of the Missions, and he bound them to this apostolic work by a perpetual vow confirmed by the Holy See. He established many associations for seeking out and aiding the unfortunate and for the education of girls. At length, worn out by bodily mortification, labours and old age, he peacefully fell asleep in the Lord in the year of salvation 1660. Famous for his miracles, he was placed among the Saints by Clement XII, and Leo XIII declared and appointed him the special heavenly patron of all charitable associations in the whole Catholic world which trace their origin in some way to him.
