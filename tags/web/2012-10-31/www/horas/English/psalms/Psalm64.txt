64:1 (To the end, a psalm of David. The canticle of Jeremias and Ezechiel to the people of the captivity, when they began to go out.)
64:2 A hymn, O God, becometh thee in Sion: and a vow shall be paid to thee in Jerusalem.
64:3 O hear my prayer: all flesh shall come to thee.
64:4 The words of the wicked have prevailed over us: and thou wilt pardon our transgressions.
64:5 Blessed is he whom thou hast chosen and taken to thee: he shall dwell in thy courts. We shall be filled with the good things of thy house; holy is thy temple,
64:6 Wonderful in justice. Hear us, O God our saviour, who art the hope of all the ends of the earth, and in the sea afar off.
64:7 Thou who preparest the mountains by thy strength, being girded with power:
64:8 Who troublest the depth of the sea, the noise of its waves. The Gentiles shall be troubled,
64:9 And they that dwell in the uttermost borders shall be afraid at thy signs: thou shalt make the outgoings of the morning and of the evening to be joyful.
64:10 Thou hast visited the earth, and hast plentifully watered it; thou hast many ways enriched it. The river of God is filled with water, thou hast prepared their food: for so is its preparation.
64:11 Fill up plentifully the streams thereof, multiply its fruits; it shall spring up and rejoice in its showers.
64:12 Thou shalt bless the crown of the year of thy goodness: and thy fields shall be filled with plenty.
64:13 The beautiful places of the wilderness shall grow fat: and the hills shall be girded about with joy,
64:14 The rams of the flock are clothed, and the vales shall abound with corn: they shall shout, yea they shall sing a hymn.
