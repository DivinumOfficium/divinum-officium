145:1 (Alleluia, of Aggeus and Zacharias.)
145:2 Praise the Lord, O my soul, in my life I will praise the Lord: I will sing to my God as long as I shall be. Put not your trust in princes:
145:3 In the children of men, in whom there is no salvation.
145:4 His spirit shall go forth, and he shall return into his earth: in that day all their thoughts shall perish.
145:5 Blessed is he who hath the God of Jacob for his helper, whose hope is in the Lord his God:
145:6 Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all things that are in them.
145:7 Who keepeth truth for ever: who executeth judgment for them that suffer wrong: who giveth food to the hungry. The Lord looseth them that are fettered:
145:8 The Lord enlighteneth the blind. The Lord lifteth up them that are cast down: the Lord loveth the just.
145:9 The Lord keepeth the strangers, he will support the fatherless and the widow: and the ways of sinners he will destroy.
145:10 The Lord shall reign for ever: thy God, O Sion, unto generation and generation.
