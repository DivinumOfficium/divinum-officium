57:1 If in very deed you speak justice: * judge right things, ye sons of men.
57:2 For in your heart you work iniquity: * your hands forge injustice in the earth.
57:3 The wicked are alienated from the womb; they have gone astray from the womb: * they have spoken false things.
57:4 Their madness is according to the likeness of a serpent: * like the deaf asp that stoppeth her ears:
57:5 Which will not hear the voice of the charmers; * nor of the wizard that charmeth wisely.
57:6 God shall break in pieces their teeth in their mouth: * the Lord shall break the grinders of the lions.
57:7 They shall come to nothing, like water running down; * he hath bent his bow till they be weakened.
57:8 Like wax that melteth they shall be taken away: * fire hath fallen on them, and they shall not see the sun.
57:9 Before your thorns could know the brier; he swalloweth them up, * as alive, in his wrath.
57:10 The just shall rejoice when he shall see the revenge: * he shall wash his hands in the blood of the sinner.
57:11 And man shall say: If indeed there be fruit to the just: * there is indeed a God that judgeth them on the earth.
