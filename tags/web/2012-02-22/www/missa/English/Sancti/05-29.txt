Lesson from the second letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians
!2 Cor 10:17-18; 11:1-2
Brethren: He who boasts, let him boast in the Lord. For he is not approved who commends himself, but he whom the Lord commends. Would to God that you could bear with a little of my foolishness! Nay, do bear with me! For I am jealous for you with a divine jealousy. For I betrothed you to one spouse, that I might present you a chaste virgin to Christ.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 25:1-3
At that time, Jesus spoke this parable to His disciples: Then will the kingdom~
of heaven be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went forth to meet the~
bridegroom and the bride. Five of them were foolish and five wise. But the five~
foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them, while the wise did~
take oil in their vessels with the lamps. Then as the bridegroom was long in~
coming, they all became drowsy and slept. And at midnight a cry arose, ‘Behold,~
the bridegroom is coming, go forth to meet him!’ Then all those virgins arose~
and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your~
oil, for our lamps are going out.’ The wise answered, saying, ‘Lest there may~
not be enough for us and for you, go rather to those who sell it, and buy some~
for yourselves.’ Now while they were gone to buy it, the bridegroom came; and~
those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was~
shut. Finally there came also the other virgins, who said, ‘Sir, sir, open the~
door for us!’ But he answered and said, ‘Amen I say to you, I do not know you.’~
Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 44:10
The daughters of kings come to meet You; the queen takes her place at Your right~
hand in gilded clothing, surrounded with variety.

[Secreta]
May the offering made by Your devoted people be pleasing to You, O Lord, in~
honor of Your Saints, through whose merits they know they have received help in~
times of trial.
