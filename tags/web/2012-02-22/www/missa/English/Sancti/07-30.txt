Lesson from the book of Wisdom
!Wis 10:17-20
God gave the holy ones the recompense of their labors, conducted them by a wondrous road, and became a shelter for them by day and a starry flame by night. He took them across the Red Sea and brought them through the deep waters - but their enemies He drowned in the sea, and cast them up from the bottom of the depths. Therefore the just despoiled the wicked; and they sang, O Lord, Your holy name and praised in unison Your conquering hand, O Lord, our God.

[Graduale]
!Ex 15:11, 6.
God is glorious in His Saints, wonderful in majesty, a worker of wonders.
V. Your right hand, O Lord, is magnificent in power; Your right hand has~
shattered the enemy. Alleluia, alleluia.
!Sir 44:14
V. The bodies of the Saints are buried in peace, but their name lives on and on.~
Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 5:1-12
At that time, Jesus, seeing the crowds, went up the mountain. And when He was~
seated, His disciples came to Him. And opening His mouth He taught them, saying,~
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are~
they who mourn, for the shall be comforted. Blessed are they who hunger and~
thirst for justice, for they shall be satisfied. Blessed are the merciful, for~
they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall see God.~
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God. Blessed~
are they who suffer persecution for justice’ sake, for theirs is the kingdom of~
heaven. Blessed are you when men reproach you, and persecute you, and speaking~
falsely, say all manner of evil against you, for My sake. Rejoice and exult,~
because your reward is great in heaven.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 67:36
God is wonderful in His Saints; the God of Israel is He Who gives power and~
strength to His people. Blessed be God! Alleluia.

[Secreta]
May this sacrificial gift, we beseech You, O Lord, which we offer in~
commemorating the anniversary of the death of Your Saints, both loose the bonds~
