From the Book of Revelation of St John Apostle
!Rev 4:1-5
1 After these things I looked, and behold a door was opened in heaven, and the~
first voice which I heard, as it were, of a trumpet speaking with me, said: Come~
up hither, and I will show thee the things which must be done hereafter.
2 And immediately I was in the spirit: and behold there was a throne set in~
heaven, and upon the throne one sitting.
3 And he that sat, was to the sight like the jasper and the sardine stone; and~
there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.
4 And round about the throne were four and twenty seats; and upon the seats,~
four and twenty ancients sitting, clothed in white garments, and on their heads~
were crowns of gold.
5 And from the throne proceeded lightnings, and voices, and thunders; and there~
were seven lamps burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God.

!Rev 4:6-8
6 And in the sight of the throne was, as it were, a sea of glass like to crystal;~
and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four living~
creatures, full of eyes before and behind.
7 And the first living creature was like a lion: and the second living creature~
like a calf: and the third living creature, having the face, as it were, of a~
man: and the fourth living creature was like an eagle flying.
8 And the four living creatures had each of them six wings; and round about and~
within they are full of eyes. And they rested not day and night, saying: Holy,~
holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come.
