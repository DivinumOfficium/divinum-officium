All wisdom * is of the Lord God, and was with Him from everlasting, yea before~
time was.

R. And let there descend upon us thy mercy.

Here beginneth the Book of Wisdom
!Wis 1:1-4
1 Love justice, you that are the judges of the earth. Think of the Lord in~
goodness, and seek him in simplicity of heart.
2 For he is found by them that tempt him not: and he showeth himself to them~
that have faith in him.
3 For perverse thoughts separate from God: and his power, when it is tried,~
reproveth the unwise:
4 For wisdom will not enter into a malicious soul, nor dwell in a body subject~
to sins.

!Wis 1:5-8
5 For the Holy Spirit of discipline will flee from the deceitful, and will~
withdraw himself from thoughts that are without understanding, and he shall not~
abide when iniquity cometh in.
6 For the spirit of wisdom is benevolent, and will not acquit the evil speaker~
from his lips: for God is witness of his reins, and he is a true searcher of his~
heart, and a hearer of his tongue.
7 For the spirit of the Lord hath filled the whole world: and that, which~
containeth all things, hath knowledge of the voice.
8 Therefore he that speaketh unjust things cannot be hid, neither shall the~
chastising judgment pass him by.

!Wis 1:9-11
9 For inquisition shall be made into the thoughts of the ungodly: and the~
hearing of his words shall come to God, to the chastising of his iniquities.
10 For the ear of jealousy heareth all things, and the tumult of murmuring shall~
not be hid.
11 Keep yourselves therefore from murmuring, which profiteth nothing, and~
refrain your tongue from detraction, for an obscure speech shall not go for~
nought: and the mouth that belieth, killeth the soul

From the Book of St Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, "On Offices."
!Bk. i. c. 28.
Great is the glory of justice. She liveth for others rather than for herself. By~
her our commonwealth and fellowship are holpen. She holdeth such a pre-eminence~
that all things are subject unto her judgment. She helpeth others. She giveth~
wealth. She refuseth not to labour. She taketh upon her the dangers of others.~
Who would not desire to hold this castle of power and courage, if the~
covetousness of our first parents had not weakened and distorted the strength of~
our nerve But so it is, that, while we are fain to increase wealth, to put by~
money, to add lands to our possessions, or to make show of our abundance, we put~
off the image of justice, and lose charity toward our brethren.

How far-spreading is the field of justice appeareth by this, that there is~
excepted therefrom no place, person, or time, nay, she hath to do even as~
regards enemies, for if one be agreed with his enemy of a certain place, or day~
for battle, it should be deemed unjust to fall on him beforehand, at some other~
place, or time. For it is a very different thing, whether one get the better of~
another in a hard fight, or by skill, or by accident. If therefore in war~
justice hath place, how much more is she to be observed in time of peace

Honour is the foundation of justice. The thoughts in the hearts of just men are~
honourable thoughts and when the just man accuseth himself, it is honour that~
bringeth him to that just deed. Then is his justice made manifest by his~
honourable avowal. The Lord saith by Isaiah " Behold, I lay in Zion a~
foundation-stone" (xxviii. 16), that is to say, He giveth Christ unto the Church~
to be her foundation. Christ is the true honour for all men, and the Church is~
as it were a figure of justice, being a commonwealth wherein all have rights,~
and which worketh as one, and suffereth as one. Whosoever denieth himself, the~
same is just, and worthy of Christ. Therefore also Paul saith " Other~
foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ " ( I Cor.~
iii. 11 ), and upon that foundation is it, that every building of justice must~
be raised. For the spirit of Christ is the true spirit of honour which is the~
foundation whereon justice resteth.
