[Lectio1]
From the letter of blessed Apostle James
!Jas 2:14-17
14 What shall it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but hath not~
works? Shall faith be able to save him?
15 And if a brother or sister be naked, and want daily food:
16 And one of you say to them: Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled; yet give~
them not those things that are necessary for the body, what shall it profit?
17 So faith also, if it have not works, is dead in itself.

[Responsory1]
R. I will sing a new song unto thee, O God Alleluia.
* Upon a psaltery of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee. Alleluia, Alleluia.
V. Thou art my God, and I will praise thee Thou art my God, and I will exalt thee.
R. Upon a psaltery of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee. Alleluia, Alleluia.

[Lectio2]
!Jas 2:18-22
18 But some man will say: Thou hast faith, and I have works: show me thy faith~
without works; and I will show thee, by works, my faith.
19 Thou believest that there is one God. Thou dost well: the devils also believe~
and tremble.
20 But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works, offering up Isaac his son upon~
the altar?
22 Seest thou, that faith did co-operate with his works; and by works faith was~
made perfect?

[Responsory2]
R. It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord Alleluia
* And to sing praises Alleluia.
V. Upon an instrument of ten strings, upon the harp with a solemn sound.
R. And to sing praises Alleluia.
&Gloria
R. And to sing praises Alleluia.

[Lectio3]
!Jas 2:23-26
23 And the scripture was fulfilled, saying: Abraham believed God, and it was~
reputed to him to justice, and he was called the friend of God.
24 Do you see that by works a man is justified; and not by faith only?
25 And in like manner also Rahab the harlot, was not she justified by works,~
receiving the messengers, and sending them out another way?
26 For even as the body without the spirit is dead; so also faith without works~
is dead.

[Responsory3]
R. Let now the redeemed of the Lord Alleluia
* Say Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
V. Let them whom He hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy, and gathered them out of the lands.
R. Say Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
&Gloria
R. Say Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.

[Ant 2]
A spirit hath not flesh and bones, * as ye see Me have now believe. Alleluia.

[Ant 3]
I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. * Howbeit,~
when He, the Spirit of truth, is come, He will guide you into all truth.~
Alleluia.~
