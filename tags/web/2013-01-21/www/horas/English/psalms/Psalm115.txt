115:10 I have believed, therefore have I spoken; but I have been humbled exceedingly.
115:11 I said in my excess: Every man is a liar.
115:12 What shall I render to the Lord, for all the things that he hath rendered to me?
115:13 I will take the chalice of salvation; and I will call upon the name of the Lord.
115:14 I will pay my vows to the Lord before all his people:
115:15 Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.
115:16 O Lord, for I am thy servant: I am thy servant, and the son of thy handmaid. Thou hast broken my bonds:
115:17 I will sacrifice to thee the sacrifice of praise, and I will call upon the name of the Lord.
115:18 I will pay my vows to the Lord in the sight of all his people:
115:19 In the courts of the house of the Lord, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem.
