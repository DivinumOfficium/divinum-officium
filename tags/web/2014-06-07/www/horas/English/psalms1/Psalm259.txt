(Canticum Sapientiae * Sap 3:1-6)
3:1 But the souls of the just are in the hand of God, and the torment of death shall not touch them.
3:2 In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die: and their departure was taken for misery:
3:3 And their going away from us, for utter destruction: but they are in peace.
3:4 And though in the sight of men they suffered torments, their hope is full of immortality.
3:5 Afflicted in few things, in many they shall be well rewarded: because God hath tried them, and found them worthy of himself.
3:6 As gold in the furnace he hath proved them, and as a victim of a holocaust he hath received them, and in time there shall be respect had to them
