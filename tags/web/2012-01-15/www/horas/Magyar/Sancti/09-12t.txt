Evangélium Szt Máté könyvébõl
!Matt 1:1-17
Jézus Krisztus, Dávid fiának, Ábrahám fiának nemzetségtáblája. Ábrahám nemzette~
Izsákot, Izsák nemzette Jákobot És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Hilary, Bishop (of Poitiers.)
!Comment, on Matth. i.)
By the generation which Matthew noteth in the Kingly, and Luke in the Priestly~
descent of our Lord, both mean to show His relationship with each race, and both~
reach it in the clear line of the pedigree which they are tracing, for that~
connection between the Kingly and Priestly houses which was begun by the~
marriage of David was fully accomplished in the link between Salathiel and~
Zorobabel. And so while Matthew recordeth the line from father to son coming~
down from Judah, and Luke teacheth the descent from the tribe of Levi through~
Nathan, both prove that by His forefathers our Lord Jesus, Who is already a King~
and a Priest from everlasting to everlasting, hath also the right to these~
dignities by earthly inheritance.

Homily by St Hilary, Bishop (of Poitiers.)
!Comment, on Matth. i.)
Homily by St Hilary, Bishop (of Poitiers.) It mattereth nothing who is actually~
inserted in the genealogy, as long as the whole line are understood to proceed~
from one source. Hence, since Joseph and Mary were of the same family, and~
Joseph is shown to have been a descendant of Abraham, Mary is shown to have been~
the same. It was a rule of the Law that if a man died without children, his next~
brother should take his widow to wife, and the first son begotten of her was~
counted as the son of her first husband. And thus the inheritance was kept in~
the line of the first-born, since the descendants who inherited were always the~
sons of the first-born, in name, if not in fact.

The next thing is, that, since we have said that, according to the ordinary~
value of terms, this genealogy is inconsistent with itself both as regards~
number and order, we should produce some explanation of this phenomenon. It is~
not a trifle that the statements should be one thing and the facts another,~
since the summary is not in accordance with the details. From Abraham to David~
are counted fourteen generations, and from David until the carrying away into~
Babylon, are found in other books seventeen. But this is neither a falsehood nor a~
piece of carelessness. There are three generations passed by. Joram begat~
Ahaziah, and Ahaziah begat Joash, and Joash begat Amaziah, and Amaziah begat~
Uzziah. But in Matthew it is stated that Joram begat Uzziah, whereas they are~
separated from each other by three clear generations. This is so because the~
woman of whom Joram begat Ahaziah was a foreign heathen, namely (Athaliah, the~
daughter) of Ahab, and Jezebel his wife.

[Lectio9]
It was declared by the Prophet that the descendants of Ahab should not sit upon~
the throne of Israel beyond the fourth generation. The stain of heathenism is~
therefore left out by omitting the three kings tainted therewith, and fourteen~
generations are counted to Mary, although they were actually in number seventeen,~
and this can seem no blunder to any that know that our Lord Jesus Christ hath~
not only that origin which He drew from Mary, but that in His bodily generation~
is comprehended a signification of His eternal generation.
