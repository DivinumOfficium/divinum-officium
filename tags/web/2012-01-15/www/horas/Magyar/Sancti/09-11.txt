!Commemoratio for the holy Martyrs Protus and Hyacinth.
Protus and Hyacinth were brethren, eunuchs of the blessed Virgin Eugenia, and~
were baptized along with her by Bishop Helenus. They gave themselves to the~
study of God's Word, and dwelt for a while in wonderful lowliness and holiness~
of life in a monastery in Egypt. However, they afterwards followed the holy~
Virgin Eugenia to Rome, in the reign of the Emperor Gallienus, and were arrested~
in that city for professing the Christian faith. By no means could they be~
brought to leave the Christian religion and to worship the gods, and they were~
therefore severely scourged and beheaded, upon the 11th day of September.
