Let us not pass by the holy Lawrence, who began to weep when he saw Sixtus his~
Bishop being led to martyrdom, not because Sixtus was going to suffer, but~
because he himself was going to remain behind. And so he began to say to him~
such words as these Father, whither goest thou without thy son Holy Priest,~
dost thou fare hence without a Deacon It hath never been thy use to offer~
sacrifice without a minister. What therefore in me hath displeased thee, my~
Father Hast thou tried me and found me unworthy to be called thy son Make~
trial if I am indeed an useless servant, even I, whom thou didst choose to~
commit unto me the administration of the cup of the Blood of the Lord unto me,~
to whom thou gavest part in the celebration of the Sacraments, dost thou refuse~
part with thee in thy blood-shedding

!Lib. 2., cap. 28., post medium.
When he was asked for the treasures of the Church, he answered that he would~
show them. The next day he brought the poor. When he was asked where were the~
treasures which he had promised, he pointed to the poor and said These are~
the treasures of the Church. And in good sooth, he was right. They are treasures~
indeed, in whom Christ is, and in whom the belief in Christ is. The Apostle~
saith We have this treasure in earthen vessels. (2 Cor. iv. 7.) What better~
treasures hath Christ than they in whom He hath said that He Himself is For~
thus is it written I was an hungered, and ye gave Me meat I was thirsty, and~
ye gave Me drink I was a stranger, and ye took Me in, and then Inasmuch as~
ye have done it unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto~
Me. (Matth. xxv. 35, 40.) These were the treasures which Lawrence showed, and he~
had the better of his persecutors, for these were treasures which they could not~
take away.

Was it not said to blessed Lawrence Thou hadst no right to disperse the riches~
of the Church, or to sell the vessels which were used for the Sacraments If~
any man is to do thus, it is a thing which must be done with the most upright~
honesty and the most wise discretion. If any man do it for his own profit, it is~
surely a sin, but if it be done to help the poor or redeem slaves, it is a work~
of mercy. For no man can say, Why doth the needy live or, Why ought we to~
ransom slaves No man can challenge it, if it be done to build the temple of~
God. No man can rebuke it, if a rule be stretched to bury the remains of the~
faithful. No man can grieve that the departed find rest in Christian~
burial-places. For these three objects it is lawful to break, melt down, or sell~
the vessels of the Church, even after they have been in use.

Evangélium Szt János Apostol könyvébõl
!John 12:24-26
Abban az idõben így szólt Jézus tanítványaihoz: Bizony, bizony, mondom nektek:~
ha a búzaszem nem hull a földbe, és nem hal el, egymaga marad. És így tovább.
_
Continuation of the Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo. As on Aug. 11.) He~
which suffereth martyrdom hath followed Christ, even to the point of having that~
love, greater than which no man hath, even that a man lay down his life for his~
friends. (John xv. 13.) Hereby also he hath laid down his life for Christ, Who~
hath said touching His members Inasmuch as ye have done it unto these, ye~
have done it unto Me. (Matth. xxv. 35, 40.) Such a servant as this He was~
pleased to make and to call Himself, as He saith: The Son of man came not to be~
ministered unto, but to minister, and to give His life a ransom for many.~
~(Matth. xx. 28.) A servant of Christ, therefore, is so called for the same~
reason that Christ is called, a servant. And thus it cometh that if any man~
serve Christ, him will the Father honour, even with the great honour that, where~
His Son is, there shall also His servant be and his joy will never wane.

When, therefore, my brethren, ye hear how that the Lord saith Where I am,~
there shall also My servant be, think not that He speaketh only of good Bishops~
and Clergymen. Do ye also do your little to serve Christ, by living well, by~
giving alms, and by proclaiming His Name and doctrine to such as ye can. Let~
every man who is father of a family know that this very name implieth that he~
should bear them a fatherly love. For Christ and for life eternal let him warn,~
teach, exhort, correct all that belong to him let him shew kindness, let him~
use discipline upon them. And so shall he discharge in his own house the office~
of the Church and, as it were, of a Bishop, serving Christ, that where He is,~
there also he may be.

!Commemoratio Ss. Mart. Hippolyto et Cassiano.
Hippolytus was one of those baptized by St Lawrence. He was arrested in his own~
house while he was taking the Holy Communion. He was brought before the Emperor~
Valerian, and, when he was asked by him touching his religious profession, he~
freely confessed that he was a Christian. Wherefore he was beaten with clubs,~
but when his faith was found only the bolder under the blows, he was tempted~
with promises of gifts and honours. Then when words were found only to be thrown~
away upon him, he was given over to the Praefect to be put to death. The~
Praefect went to the house of Hippolytus to take possession of his goods, and~
there found that all the household were Christians. He strove in vain to awe~
them into the denial of their faith, and then ordered Concordia, the nurse of~
Hippolytus, who was encouraging the rest, to be beaten to death with whips~
loaded with lead, and afterwards the others to be slain outside the gate that~
leadeth toward Tivoli. Hippolytus was tied to wild horses which dragged him~
through rough places full of briars and thistles, until with a mangled body he~
resigned his soul to God. Justin the Priest buried him along with the others. On~
the same day, at Imola, the martyr Cassian was put to a most cruel death. He was a~
schoolmaster, and was given up to his scholars, with his hands bound behind his~
back, to be stabbed and torn to death with steel pens. Owing to the weakness of~
the means, the suffering of his martyrdom was very grievous and long, and his~
palm all the more glorious.
