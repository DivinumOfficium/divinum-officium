[Hymnus Vespera]
v. Father of lights! one glance of thine,
Whose eyes the universe control,
Fills Magdalene with holy love,
And melts the ice within her soul.
_
Her precious ointment forth she brings
Upon those sacred feet to pour;
She washes them with burning tears,
And with her hair she wipes them o'er.
_
Impassioned, to the cross she clings,
Nor fears beside the tomb to stay;
Nor dreads the soldiers' savage mien,
For love has cast all fear away.
_
O Christ, thou very love itself!
Blest hope of man, through thee forgiven!
So touch our spirits from above,
So purify our souls for heaven.
_
To God the Father, with the Son
And Holy Paraclete, with thee,
As evermore hath been before,
Be glory through eternity.
Amen.

[Versum 1]
V. Grace is poured into thy lips.
R. Therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.

[Ant 1]
A woman in the city * which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat~
in the house of Simon the leper, brought an alabaster box of ointment, and stood~
at the Feet of Jesus, behind Him, weeping, and began to wash His Feet with tears,~
and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed His Feet, and anointed~
them with the ointment.

[Oratio]
Lord, we pray thee that we may be holpen by the pleading of Blessed Mary~
Magdalen, whose prayers so much availed with thee, that Thou didst call up her~
brother Lazarus living from the dead, when he had lain in the grave four days~
already.

Maria Magdalena megtereseert, * Aldjuk az Urat

[Hymnus Matutinum]
v. His sacred feet with tears of agony
She bathes; and prostrate on the ground adores;
Steeps them in kisses chaste, and wipes them dry
With her own hair; then forth her precious ointment pours.
_
Praise in the highest to the Father be;
Praise to the mighty co-eternal Son;
And praise, O Spirit Paraclete, to thee,
While ages evermore of endless ages run.
Amen.

De Canticis canticorum.
!Song 3:1-4
1 Éjszaka ágyamban kerestem, akit szeret a lelkem. De hiába kerestem, nem~
találtam.
2 "Azért hát fölkelek, bejárom a várost, keresem a tereken és az utcákon, akit~
szeret a lelkem." Hiába kerestem, nem találtam!
3 Találkoztam az õrökkel, akik a várost járták. "Nem láttátok, akit szeret a~
lelkem?"
4 Alig mentem tovább, otthagyva õket, megtaláltam, akit szeret a lelkem.~
Belekapaszkodtam, és nem engedem el, amíg be nem viszem anyámnak házába, annak~
szobájába, ki méhében hordozott.

[Responsory1]
R. Mary Magdalen and the other Mary went very early to the sepulchre.
* That Jesus Whom ye seek, is not here; for He is risen, as He said He goeth~
before you into Galilee; there shall ye see Him.
V. And very early in the morning, the first day of the week, they came unto~
the sepulchre, at the rising of the sun; and, entering into the sepulchre, they~
saw a young man sitting upon the right side, who saith unto them
R. That Jesus Whom ye seek, is not here; for He is risen, as He said He goeth~
before you into Galilee; there shall ye see Him.

!Song 8:1-7
1 Bár testvérem volnál, és szoptad volna az anyám emlõjét! Ha utcán lelnélek,~
ott megcsókolnálak, akkor nem vethetne meg érte senki.
2 Magammal vinnélek és bevezetnélek anyámnak házába, és tanítgatnál, én meg~
itatnálak fûszerezett borral, gránátalma-musttal.
3 A balját a fejem alá teszi, a jobbjával meg átkarol.
4 Jeruzsálem lányai, kérlek benneteket, ne zavarjátok, ne ébresszétek föl~
szerelmemet, amíg maga nem akarja.

[Responsory2]
R. Rejoice with me, all ye that love the Lord for I sought Him and He hath~
appeared unto me
* And while as I was weeping at the Sepulchre, I saw the Lord.
V. When His disciples were gone away, I tarried still; and the fire of love in~
my heart yearned after Him.
R. And while as I was weeping at the Sepulchre, I saw the Lord.

!Song 8:5-7
5 Ki az ott, aki a puszta felõl erre tart és a szerelmesére támaszkodik? Az~
almafa alatt keltettelek föl. Ott, ahol vajúdni kezdett veled anyád, ahol kínok~
közt fetrengett, aki megszült.
6 Tegyél a szívedre pecsétnek, mint valami pecsétet a karodra! Mert mint a halál,~
olyan erõs a szerelem, olyan a szenvedély, mint az alvilág. Nyila tüzes nyíl, az~
Úrnak lángja.
7 Tengernyi víz sem olthatja el a szerelmet, egész folyamok sem tudnák~
elsodorni. Ha valaki háza egész vagyonát felkínálná is a szerelemért, azt is~
kevesellnék!

[Responsory3]
R. They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid Him. The~
Angels say unto her Woman, why weepest thou? He is risen, as He said.
* He goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see Him.
V. And as she wept, she stooped down and looked into the Sepulchre, and saw two~
Angels in white, sitting; and they say unto her
R. He goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see Him.
&Gloria
R. He goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see Him.

From the Sermons of Pope St Gregory (the Great.)
!25 th on the Gospels.
Mary Magdalen, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, through love of the~
truth, washed away in her tears the defilement of her sins, and the words of the~
Truth are fulfilled which He spake Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for~
she loved much. She who had remained chilly in sin, became fiery through love.~
When even His disciples went away again unto their own home, Mary still stood~
without at the sepulchre of Christ, weeping. She sought Him Whom her soul loved,~
but she found Him not. She searched for Him with tears; she yearned with strong~
desire for Him Who, she believed, had been taken away. And thus it befell her,~
that being the only one who had remained to seek Him, she was the only one that~
saw Him. It is the truth that the backbone of a good work is perseverance.

[Lectio5]
At first when she sought Him, she found Him not; she went on searching, and so~
it came to pass that she found Him; and this was so, to the end that her longing~
might grow in earnestness, and so in its earnestness might find what it sought.~
Hence is it that the Bride in the Song of Songs saith as representing the~
Church: By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth. We seek on our bed~
for Him Whom our soul loveth, when, having got some little rest in this world,~
we still sigh for the Presence of our Redeemer but it is by night that we so~
seek Him, for though our mind may be on the alert for Him, yet still He is~
hidden from our eyes by the darkness that now is.

[Lectio6]
But if we find not Him Whom our soul loveth, it remaineth that we should rise~
and go about the city, that is, by thought and questioning, go through the holy~
Church of the elect seek Him in the streets, and in the broad ways, that is,~
walk anxiously looking about us both in the narrow and the broad places, that if~
we can, we may find His footsteps there for there are some even of those who~
live for the world, from whom something may be learnt to be imitated by a godly~
man. As we thus go wakefully about, the watchmen, that keep the city, find us;~
the holy Fathers, who are the watchmen of the bulwarks of the Church, come to~
meet our good endeavours, and to teach us either by their words or by their~
writings. And it needeth but a little to pass from them, but we find Him Whom~
our soul loveth (a little we must pass,) for albeit our Redeemer in lowliness~
became a man among men, yet by right of His Divine Nature He is still above men.

Evangélium Szt Lukács könyvébõl
!Luke 7:36
Azon idõben egy farizeus meghívta Jézust, hogy egyék nála. Betért hát a farizeus~
házába, és asztalhoz telepedett. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!Bk. 1. Horn. 23, torn, x.
Ye have listened carefully to the Gospel whileas it was being read, so that the~
thing told hath, as it were, passed before the eyes of your heart. Ye have seen~
in your mind's eye, albeit not with bodily sight, the Lord Jesus Christ sitting~
down to meat in the Pharisee's house, and not refusing when He is bidden of him.~
Ye have seen also an infamous woman of the city, one of utterly bad character, a~
sinner, thrusting herself in an uninvited guest, to the banquet where her Healer~
was sitting, and seeking health at His hands with godly shamelessness; thrusting~
herself in eager for mercy, as though eager for the feast. She knew under what a~
disease she laboured, and she knew that He unto Whom she came was mighty to cure~
it.

[Lectio8]
She drew near therefore, not unto the Lord's Head, but unto His Feet. She that~
had so long walked the paths of sin betook her unto the Feet that went about~
doing good. She first poured forth heart-felt tears, and washed the Lord's Feet~
with the humble service of her acknowledgment, wiped them with her hair, kissed~
them, and anointed them. Her silence cried aloud, next in words but in~
manifested love. The Pharisee, who had desired the Lord Jesus Christ that He~
would eat with him, belonged to that class of proud men concerning whom the~
Prophet Isaiah saith people which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to~
me; for I am holier than thou. (lxv. 5.) When therefore he saw how this woman~
touched the Lord's Feet with her tears, her kisses, her hair, and her ointment,~
he spake within himself, saying This Man, if He were a Prophet, would have~
known who and what manner of woman this is, that toucheth Him; for she is a~
sinner.

[Lectio9]
Pharisee, that biddest and scornest the Lord! Thou invitest the Lord to meat,~
and thou knowest not Him That should have given thee to eat! Whence knowest thou~
that the Lord knoweth not who and what manner of woman this is, save from this,~
that she is allowed to draw near unto Him, and that He suffereth her to kiss His~
Feet, to wipe them, and to anoint them? Ought not an unclean woman to have been~
permitted to do these things to clean feet? If such a woman had drawn near to~
the feet of this Pharisee, he would have said to her what Isaiah putteth into~
the mouth of such Stand by thyself, come not near to me, for I am holier than~
thou. But she came unto the Lord unclean that she might go away cleansed, sick,~
that she might go away healed, with confession, that she might go away with~
thanksgiving.

[Hymnus Laudes]
v. Son of the Highest, deign to cast
On us a pitying eye;
Thou, who repentant Magdalene
Didst call to endless joy.
_
Again the royal treasury
Receives its long-lost coin;
The gem is found, and, cleansed from mire,
Doth all the stars outshine.
_
O Jesus, balm of every wound!
The sinner's only stay!
Wash thou in Magdalene's pure tears
Our guilty spots away.
_
Mother of God! the sons of Eve
Weeping thine aid implore:
Oh, land us from the storms of life
Safe on th' eternal shore.
_
Glory, for graces manifold,
To the one only Lord;
Whose mercy doth our souls forgive,
Whose bounty doth reward.
Amen.

[Versum 2]
V. God hath chosen her and forechosen her.
R. He hath made her to dwell in His tabernacle.

[Ant 2]
Mary anointed * the Feet of Jesus, and wiped Them with her hair; and the house~
was filled with the odour of the ointment.
