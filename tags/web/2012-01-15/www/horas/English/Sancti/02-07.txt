[Oratio]
May the pleading of blessed Romuald Abbot make us acceptable unto thee O Lord,~
we pray; that what we may not have through any merits of ours, we may gain by~
means of his patronage
$Per Dominum

[Lectio4]
The holy Abbat Romuald was the son of one Sergius, of a noble family of Ravenna.~
While he was still very young, he went to a neighbouring monastery at Classis to~
do penance. While he was there he heard a discourse by a monk, which stirred him~
up strongly to aim at godliness of living; and he had afterwards in the Church~
by night two visions in which the blessed servant of God Apollinaris foretold to~
him that he should become a monk himself. He accordingly did so; and soon~
afterwards betook himself to one Marinus, whose holy life and strict discipline~
were then much noised about in all the coasts of the Venetians, that he might by~
his teaching and guidance attain towards the hard and lofty point of perfection.

[Lectio5]
The more he was assailed by the wiles of Satan and the unkindness of men, the~
more did he exercise himself in lowliness, with continual fasting and prayer,~
and rejoice in thinking of heavenly things, with abundance of tears. And all the~
while he bore so bright a face as gladdened all who looked on him. He was held~
in great honour by princes and kings, and his counsel moved many to leave the~
blandishments of the world and withdraw to the desert. He had such a burning~
desire to obtain the crown of martyrdom that he set out for Pannonia on purpose~
to seek it, but, falling into sickness whenever he went forward though growing~
strong again whenever he drew back, he behoved to return home.

[Lectio6]
God worked miracles by him both during his life and after his death, and~
likewise gave him the gift of prophecy. Like the Patriarch Jacob, he saw a~
ladder reaching from earth to heaven, and men in white garments ascending and~
descending upon it, in whom he marvellously knew were represented the monks of~
the Camaldolese Institute, of which he was the founder. At the age of 120 years,~
of which he had spent 100 in serving God in great hardness, he passed into His~
Presence, in the year of Salvation 1027. Five years after his death his body was~
found incorrupt, and laid in a magnificent grave in the Church of his order at~
Fabriano.

[Lectio94]
Romuald was born o{ a noble family of Ravenna; his father's name being Sergius,~
and. as a young man, withdrew to the neighboring monastery of Classis to lead a~
life of penance. There, fired with great eagerness for the love of God and~
encouraged bv an apparition of St' Apollinaris, he became a monk. He exercised~
himself un-wearyingly in fasting and prayer, and such joy showed on his face that~
it gladdened all those who saw him. Burning with desire for martyrdom, he set~
out for Pannonia, but was taken ill and forced to return. He became the founder~
of the Order of Camaldolese monks, whom he had seen in a vision as Angels~
mountains a ladder that reached up to the heaven. When he had reached the age of a~
hundred and twenty. having served God in the greatest austerity for a hundred of~
those years, he at length made his wa' to Him in the Year of salvation 1027, and~
was buried with honor in the church of his Order at Fabriano.
