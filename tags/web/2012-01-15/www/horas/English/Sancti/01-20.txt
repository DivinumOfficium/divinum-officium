[Oratio]
Mercifully consider our weakness, O Almighty God, and whereas by the burden of~
our sins we are sore let and hindered, grant that we may be relieved by the~
prayers of thy blessed and glorious Martyrs Fabian and Sebastian.
$Per Dominum

[Lectio4]
Fabian was a Roman, and sat as Pope from (the year of our Lord 236, in) the~
reign of the Emperor Maximin till (250, in) that of Decius. He appointed a~
Deacon to each of the seven districts of Rome to look after the poor. He~
likewise appointed the same number of Subdeacons to collect the acts of the~
Martyrs from the records kept by the seven district notaries. It was by him that~
it was ordained that every Maundy Thursday the old Chrism should be burnt and~
new consecrated. He was crowned with martyrdom upon the 20th of January, in the~
persecution of Decius, and buried in the cemetery of St Kallistus on the Appian~
Way, having sat in the throne of Peter fifteen years and four days. He held five~
Advent ordinations, in which he ordained twenty - two Priests, seven Deacons,~
and eleven Bishops for divers Sees.

[Lectio5]
The father of Sebastian was of Narbonne, and his mother a Milanese. He was a~
great favourite of the Emperor Diocletian, both on account of his noble birth~
and his personal bravery, and was by him appointed captain of the first company~
of the Praetorian Guards. He was in secret a Christian, and often supported the~
others both by good offices and money. When some showed signs of yielding under~
persecution, he so successfully exhorted them, that, for Jesus Christ's sake,~
many offered themselves to the tormentors. Among these were the brothers Mark~
and Marcellian who were imprisoned at Rome in the house of Nicostratus. The wife~
of Nicostratus himself, named Zoe, had lost her voice, but it was restored to~
her at the prayer of Sebastian. These facts becoming known to Diocletian, he~
sent for Sebastian, and after violently rebuking him, used every means to turn~
him from his faith in Christ. But as neither promises nor threats availed, he~
ordered him to be tied to a post and shot to death with arrows.

[Lectio6]
Sebastian was treated accordingly, and left for dead, but in the night the holy~
widow Irene sent for the body in order to bury it, and then found that he was~
still alive, and nursed him in her own house. As soon as his health was restored,~
he went out to meet Diocletian, and boldly rebuked him for his wickedness. The~
Emperor was first thunderstruck at the sight of a man whom he believed to have~
been some time dead, but afterwards, frenzied with rage at tl\e reproaches of~
Sebastian, ordered him to be beaten to death with rods, under which torment the~
martyr yielded his blessed soul to God, (upon the 20th day of January, in the~
year of our Lord 288.) His body was thrown into a sewer, but he appeared in~
sleep to Lucina, and made known to her where it was, and where he would have it~
buried. She accordingly found it and laid it in those Catacombs, over which a~
famous Church hath since been built, called St Sebastian'swithout-the-Walls.

[Lectio94]
Fabian a Roman ruled the Church from the time of Maximian to that of Decius. He~
divided the City into seven districts and assigned a deacon to each to care for~
the poor. He appointed the same number of subdeacons to collect the Acts of the~
Martyrs from the records of the district notaries. He decreed that every year on~
Holy Thursday the old chrism be burned and new chrism consecrated. At length, on~
January 20, he was crowned with martyrdom and buried in the cemetery of~
Callistus on the Appian Way. - Sebastian was a favorite with Diocletian .for~
his. noble birth and his bravery, and was and was made captain of the first~
company of the praetorian guards. He aided the Christians, whose faith he~
secretly practiced, both by, deeds and by material help and strengthened them in~
professing Christ. When all this was reported to Diocletian, he tried.by every~
means to turn Sebastian awav :from faith in Christ. But when neither promises~
nor threats were successful, he ordered him to be tied to spot and shot through~
with arrows. The servant of God was then thought by all to be dead;- but shortly~
afterwards, restored to health, he appeared in Diocletian's presence and boldly~
rebuked him for his wickedness. Then the tyrant ordered him beaten with rods~
until he expired.
