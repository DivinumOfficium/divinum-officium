89:1 Lord, thou hast been our refuge * from generation to generation.
89:2 Before the mountains were made, or the earth and the world was formed; * from eternity and to eternity thou art God.
89:3 Turn not man away to be brought low: * and thou hast said: Be converted, O ye sons of men.
89:4 For a thousand years in thy sight * are as yesterday, which is past.
89:5 And as a watch in the night, * things that are counted nothing, shall their years be.
89:6 In the morning man shall grow up like grass; in the morning he shall flourish and pass away: * in the evening he shall fall, grow dry, and wither.
89:7 For in thy wrath we have fainted away: * and are troubled in thy indignation.
89:8 Thou hast set our iniquities before thy eyes: * our life in the light of thy countenance.
89:9 For all our days are spent; * and in thy wrath we have fainted away.
89:10 Our years shall be considered as a spider: * the days of our years in them are threescore and ten years.
89:11 But if in the strong they be fourscore years: * and what is more of them is labour and sorrow.
89:12 For mildness is come upon us: * and we shall be corrected.
89:13 Who knoweth the power of thy anger, * and for thy fear can number thy wrath?
89:14 So make thy right hand known: * and men learned in heart, in wisdom.
89:15 Return, O Lord, how long? * and be entreated in favour of thy servants.
89:16 We are filled in the morning with thy mercy: * and we have rejoiced, and are delighted all our days.
89:17 We have rejoiced for the days in which thou hast humbled us: * for the years in which we have seen evils.
89:18 Look upon thy servants and upon their works: * and direct their children.
89:19 And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us: and direct thou the works of our hands over us; * yea, the work of our hands do thou direct.
