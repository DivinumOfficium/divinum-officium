39:1 With expectation I have waited for the Lord, * and he was attentive to me.
39:2 And he heard my prayers, * and brought me out of the pit of misery and the mire of dregs.
39:3 And he set my feet upon a rock, * and directed my steps.
39:4 And he put a new canticle into my mouth, * a song to our God.
39:5 Many shall see, and shall fear: * and they shall hope in the Lord.
39:6 Blessed is the man whose trust is in the name of the Lord; * and who hath not had regard to vanities, and lying follies.
39:7 Thou hast multiplied thy wonderful works, O Lord my God: * and in thy thoughts there is no one like to thee.
39:8 I have declared and I have spoken * they are multiplied above number.
39:9 Sacrifice and oblation thou didst not desire; * but thou hast pierced ears for me.
39:9 Burnt offering and sin offering thou didst not require: * then said I, Behold I come.
39:9 In the head of the book it is written of me that I should do thy will: * O my God, I have desired it, and thy law in the midst of my heart.
39:10 I have declared thy justice in a great church, * lo, I will not restrain my lips: O Lord, thou knowest it.
39:11 I have not hid thy justice within my heart: * I have declared thy truth and thy salvation.
39:12 I have not concealed thy mercy and thy truth * from a great council.
39:13 Withhold not thou, O Lord, thy tender mercies from me: * thy mercy and thy truth have always upheld me.
39:14 For evils without number have surrounded me; * my iniquities have overtaken me, and I was not able to see.
39:14 They are multiplied above the hairs of my head: * and my heart hath forsaken me.
39:14 Be pleased, O Lord to deliver me: * look down, O Lord, to help me.
39:15 Let them be confounded and ashamed together, that seek after my soul * to take it away.
39:16 Let them be turned backward and be ashamed * that desire evils to me.
39:17 Let them immediately bear their confusion, * that say to me: ‘T is well, ‘t is well.
39:18 Let all that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: * and let such as love thy salvation say always: The Lord be magnified.
39:18 But I am a beggar and poor: * the Lord is careful for me.
39:18 Thou art my helper and my protector: * O my God, be not slack.
