93:1 The Lord is the God to whom revenge belongeth: * the God of revenge hath acted freely.
93:2 Lift up thyself, thou that judgest the earth: * render a reward to the proud.
93:3 How long shall sinners, O Lord: * how long shall sinners glory?
93:4 Shall they utter, and speak iniquity: * shall all speak who work injustice?
93:5 Thy people, O Lord, they have brought low: * and they have afflicted thy inheritance.
93:6 They have slain the widow and the stranger: * and they have murdered the fatherless.
93:7 And they have said: The Lord shall not see: * neither shall the God of Jacob understand.
93:8 Understand, ye senseless among the people: * and, you fools, be wise at last.
93:9 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? * or he that formed the eye, doth he not consider?
93:10 He that chastiseth nations, shall he not rebuke: * he that teacheth man knowledge?
93:11 The Lord knoweth the thoughts of men, * that they are vain.
93:12 Blessed is the man whom thou shalt instruct, O Lord: * and shalt teach him out of thy law.
93:13 That thou mayst give him rest from the evil days: * till a pit be dug for the wicked.
93:14 For the Lord will not cast off his people: * neither will he forsake his own inheritance.
93:15 Until justice be turned into judgment: * and they that are near it are all the upright in heart.
93:16 Who shall rise up for me against the evildoers? * or who shall stand with me against the workers of iniquity?
93:17 Unless the Lord had been my helper, * my soul had almost dwelt in hell.
93:18 If I said: My foot is moved: * thy mercy, O Lord, assisted me.
93:19 According to the multitude of my sorrows in my heart, * thy comforts have given joy to my soul.
93:20 Doth the seat of iniquity stick to thee, * who framest labour in commandment?
93:21 They will hunt after the soul of the just, * and will condemn innocent blood.
93:22 But the Lord is my refuge: * and my God the help of my hope.
93:23 And he will render them their iniquity: and in their malice he will destroy them: * the Lord our God will destroy them.
