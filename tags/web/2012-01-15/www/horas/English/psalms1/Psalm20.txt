20:1 In thy strength, O Lord, the king shall joy; * and in thy salvation he shall rejoice exceedingly.
20:2 Thou hast given him his heart’s desire: * and hast not withholden from him the will of his lips.
20:3 For thou hast prevented him with blessings of sweetness: * thou hast set on his head a crown of precious stones.
20:4 He asked life of thee: * and thou hast given him length of days for ever and ever.
20:5 His glory is great in thy salvation: * glory and great beauty shalt thou lay upon him.
20:6 For thou shalt give him to be a blessing for ever and ever: * thou shalt make him joyful in gladness with thy countenance.
20:7 For the king hopeth in the Lord: * and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.
20:8 Let thy hand be found by all thy enemies: * let thy right hand find out all them that hate thee.
20:9 Thou shalt make them as an oven of fire, * in the time of thy anger: the Lord shall trouble them in his wrath, and fire shall devour them.
20:10 Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth: * and their seed from among the children of men.
20:11 For they have intended evils against thee: * they have devised counsels which they have not been able to establish.
20:12 For thou shalt make them turn their back: * in thy remnants thou shalt prepare their face.
20:13 Be thou exalted, O Lord, in thy own strength: * we will sing and praise thy power.
