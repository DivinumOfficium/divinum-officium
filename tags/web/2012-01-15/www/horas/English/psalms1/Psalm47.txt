47:1 Great is the Lord, and exceedingly to be praised * in the city of our God, in his holy mountain.
47:2 With the joy of the whole earth is mount Sion founded, * on the sides of the north, the city of the great king.
47:3 In her houses shall God be known, * when he shall protect her.
47:4 For behold the kings of the earth assembled themselves: * they gathered together.
47:5 So they saw, and they wondered, they were troubled, they were moved: * trembling took hold of them.
47:6 There were pains as of a woman in labour; * with a vehement wind thou shalt break in pieces the ships of Tharsis.
47:7 As we have heard, so have we seen, in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God: * God hath founded it for ever.
47:8 We have received thy mercy, O God, * in the midst of thy temple.
47:9 According to thy name, O God, so also is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: * thy right hand is full of justice.
47:10 Let mount Sion rejoice, and the daughters of Juda be glad; * because of thy judgments, O Lord.
47:11 Surround Sion, and encompass her: * tell ye in her towers.
47:12 Set your hearts on her strength; and distribute her houses, * that ye may relate it in another generation.
47:13 For this is God, our God unto eternity, and for ever and ever: * he shall rule us for evermore.
