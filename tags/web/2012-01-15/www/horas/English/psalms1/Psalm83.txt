83:1 How lovely are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts! * my soul longeth and fainteth for the courts of the Lord.
83:2 My heart and my flesh * have rejoiced in the living God.
83:3 For the sparrow hath found herself a house, * and the turtledove a nest for herself where she may lay her young ones:
83:4 Thy altars, O Lord of hosts, * my king and my God.
83:5 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house, O Lord: * they shall praise thee for ever and ever.
83:6 Blessed is the man whose help is from thee: * in his heart he hath disposed to ascend by steps, in the vale of tears, in the place which he hath set.
83:7 For the lawgiver shall give a blessing, they shall go from virtue to virtue: * the God of gods shall be seen in Sion.
83:9 O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer: * give ear, O God of Jacob.
83:10 Behold, O God our protector: * and look on the face of thy Christ.
83:11 For better is one day in thy courts * above thousands.
83:12 I have chosen to be an abject in the house of my God, * rather than to dwell in the tabernacles of sinners.
83:13 For God loveth mercy and truth: * the Lord will give grace and glory.
83:13 He will not deprive of good things them that walk in innocence: * O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.
