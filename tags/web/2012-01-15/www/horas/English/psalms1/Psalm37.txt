37:1 Rebuke me not, O Lord, in thy indignation; * nor chastise me in thy wrath.
37:2 For thy arrows are fastened in me: * and thy hand hath been strong upon me.
37:3 There is no health in my flesh, because of thy wrath: * there is no peace for my bones, because of my sins.
37:4 For my iniquities are gone over my head: * and as a heavy burden are become heavy upon me.
37:5 My sores are putrified and corrupted, * because of my foolishness.
37:6 I am become miserable, and am bowed down even to the end: * I walked sorrowful all the day long.
37:7 For my loins are filled with illusions; * and there is no health in my flesh.
37:8 I am afflicted and humbled exceedingly: * I roared with the groaning of my heart.
37:9 Lord, all my desire is before thee, * and my groaning is not hidden from thee.
37:10 My heart is troubled, my strength hath left me, * and the light of my eyes itself is not with me.
37:12 My friends and my neighbours *have drawn near, and stood against me.
37:13 And they that were near me stood afar off: * and they that sought my soul used violence.
37:14 And they that sought evils to me spoke vain things, * and studied deceits all the day long.
37:15 But I, as a deaf man, heard not: * and as a dumb man not opening his mouth.
37:16 And I became as a man that heareth not: * and that hath no reproofs in his mouth.
37:17 For in thee, O Lord, have I hoped: * thou wilt hear me, O Lord my God.
37:18 For I said: Lest at any time my enemies rejoice over me: * and whilst my feet are moved, they speak great things against me.
37:19 For I am ready for scourges: * and my sorrow is continually before me.
37:20 For I will declare my iniquity: * and I will think for my sin.
37:21 But my enemies live, and are stronger that I: * and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.
37:22 They that render evil for good, have detracted me, * because I followed goodness.
37:23 Forsake me not, O Lord my God: * do not thou depart from me. 
37:23 Attend unto my help, * O Lord, the God of my salvation.
