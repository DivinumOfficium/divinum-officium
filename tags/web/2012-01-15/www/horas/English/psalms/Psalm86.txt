86:1 (For the sons of Core, a psalm of a canticle. The foundations thereof are the holy mountains:)
86:2 The Lord loveth the gates of Sion above all the tabernacles of Jacob.
86:3 Glorious things are said of thee, O city of God.
86:4 I will be mindful of Rahab and of Babylon knowing me. Behold the foreigners, and Tyre, and the people of the Ethiopians, these were there.
86:5 Shall not Sion say: This man and that man is born in her? and the Highest himself hath founded her.
86:6 The Lord shall tell in his writings of peoples and of princes, of them that have been in her.
86:7 The dwelling in thee is as it were of all rejoicing.
