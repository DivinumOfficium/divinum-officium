143:1 Blessed be the Lord my God, who teacheth my hands to fight, and my fingers to war.
143:2 My mercy, and my refuge: my support, and my deliverer: My protector, and I have hoped in him: who subdueth my people under me.
143:3 Lord, what is man, that thou art made known to him? or the son of man, that thou makest account of him?
143:4 Man is like to vanity: his days pass away like a shadow.
143:5 Lord, bow down thy heavens and descend: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
143:6 Send forth lightning, and thou shalt scatter them: shoot out thy arrows, and thou shalt trouble them.
143:7 Put forth thy hand from on high, take me out, and deliver me from many waters: from the hand of strange children:
143:8 Whose mouth hath spoken vanity: and their right hand is the right hand of iniquity.
143:9 To thee, O God, I will sing a new canticle: on the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings I will sing praises to thee.
143:10 Who givest salvation to kings: who hast redeemed thy servant David from the malicious sword:
143:11 Deliver me, And rescue me out of the hand of strange children; whose mouth hath spoken vanity: and their right hand is the right hand of iniquity:
143:12 Whose sons are as new plants in their youth: Their daughters decked out, adorned round about after the similitude of a temple:
143:13 Their storehouses full, flowing out of this into that. Their sheep fruitful in young, abounding in their goings forth:
143:14 Their oxen fat. There is no breach of wall, nor passage, nor crying out in their streets.
143:15 They have called the people happy, that hath these things: but happy is that people whose God is the Lord.
