(Canticum Annae 1 Sam 2:1-10)
1 My heart hath rejoiced in the Lord, and my horn is exalted in my God: my mouth is enlarged over my enemies: because I have joyed in thy salvation. 
2 There is none holy as the Lord is: for there is no other beside thee, and there is none strong like our God. 
3 Do not multiply to speak lofty things, boasting: let old matters depart from your mouth: for the Lord is a God of all knowledge, and to him are thoughts prepared. 
4 The bow of the mighty is overcome, and the weak are girt with strength. 
5 They that were full before have hired out themselves for bread: and the hungry are filled, so that the barren hath borne many: and she that had many children is weakened.
6 The Lord killeth and maketh alive, he bringeth down to hell and bringeth back again. 
7 The Lord maketh poor and maketh rich, he humbleth and he exalteth. 
8 He raiseth up the needy from the dust, and lifteth up the poor from the dunghill: that he may sit with princes, and hold the throne of glory. For the poles of the earth are the Lord's, and upon them he hath set the world. 
9 He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness, because no man shall prevail by his own strength. 
10 The adversaries of the Lord shall fear him: and upon them shall he thunder in the heavens. The Lord shall judge the ends of the earth, and he shall give empire to his king, and shall exalt the horn of his Christ.
