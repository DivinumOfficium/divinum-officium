45:9 Come and behold ye the works of the Lord: what wonders he hath done upon earth,
45:10 Making wars to cease even to the end of the earth. He shall destroy the bow, and break the weapons: and the shield he shall burn in the fire.
45:11 Be still and see that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, and I will be exalted in the earth.
45:12 The Lord of armies is with us: the God of Jacob is our protector.
