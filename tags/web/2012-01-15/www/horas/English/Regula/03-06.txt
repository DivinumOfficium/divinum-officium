03-06# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 29: If Brethren Who Go Out From the Monastery Ought to Be Received Back Again
_
If a brother who departs from the monastery through his own fault should desire to return, let him first promise complete amendment of the fault for which he departed and so let him be received back in the lowest grade, that by this means his humility may be proved. But if he go forth again, unto the third time let him be thus received back, but knowing now that henceforth all readmission will be denied him.
