02-19# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 16: How the Work of God Is to Be Carried Out During the Day
_
As says the prophet: “Seven times a day have I offered Thee praise.” The which sacred number of seven we fulfill in this way, if at Lauds Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers and Compline time we discharge the duties of our service. For concerning these hours the prophet said: “Seven times a day have I offered Thee praise.” For, again, concerning night office the same prophet says: “In the middle of the night am I wont to rise and praise Thee.” Therefore let us ascribe to our Creator praise for the judgments of His justice at these hours, namely, at Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers, Compline; and at night let us rise to praise Him.
