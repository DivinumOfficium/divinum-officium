[Lectio1]
From the Book of Revelation to St John Apostle.
!Rev 2:1-7
1 Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write: These things saith he, who~
holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven~
golden candlesticks:
2 I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not~
bear them that are evil, and thou hast tried them, who say they are apostles,~
and are not, and hast found them liars:
3 And thou hast patience, and hast endured for my name, and hast not fainted.
4 But I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first charity.
5 Be mindful therefore from whence thou art fallen: and do penance, and do the~
first works. Or else I come to thee, and will move thy candlestick out of its~
place, except thou do penance.
6 But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaites, which I also~
hate.
7 He, that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches: To~
him, that overcometh, I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the~
paradise of my God.

!Rev 2:8-11
8 And to the angel of the church of Smyrna write: These things saith the First~
and the Last, who was dead, and is alive:
9 I know thy tribulation and thy poverty, but thou art rich: and thou art~
blasphemed by them that say they are Jews and are not, but are the synagogue of~
Satan.
10 Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer. Behold, the devil will~
cast some of you into prison that you may be tried: and you shall have~
tribulation ten days. Be thou faithful until death: and I will give thee the~
crown of life.
11 He, that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches: He~
that shall overcome, shall not be hurt by the second death.

[Responsory2]

!Rev 2:12-17
12 And to the angel of the church of Pergamus write: These things, saith he,~
that hath the sharp two edged sword:
13 I know where thou dwellest, where the seat of Satan is: and thou holdest fast~
my name, and hast not denied my faith. Even in those days when Antipas was my~
faithful witness, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.
14 But I have against thee a few things: because thou hast there them that hold~
the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the~
children of Israel, to eat, and to commit fornication:
15 So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaites.
16 In like manner do penance: if not, I will come to thee quickly, and will~
fight against them with the sword of my mouth.
17 He, that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches: To~
him that overcometh, I will give the hidden manna, and will give him a white~
counter, and in the counter, a new name written, which no man knoweth, but he~
that receiveth it.

his Christ, alleluia, alleluia.
V. And a voice came out from the throne, saying: Give praise to our God, all ye~
his servants: and you that fear him, little and great.
R. Now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power~
of his Christ, alleluia, alleluia.
