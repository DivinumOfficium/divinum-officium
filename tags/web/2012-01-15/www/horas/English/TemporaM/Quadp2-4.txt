Lesson from the book of Genesis
!Gen 9:12-15
12 And God said: This is the sign of the covenant which I will give between me~
and you, and to every living soul that is with you, for perpetual generations.
13 I will set my bow in the clouds, and it shall be the sign of a covenant~
between me, and between the earth.
14 And when I shall cover the sky with clouds, my bow shall appear in the~
clouds:
15 And I will remember my covenant with you, and with every living soul that~
beareth flesh: and there shall no more be waters of a flood to destroy all~
flesh.

!Gen 9:20-23
20 And Noe, a husbandman, began to till the ground, and planted a vineyard.
21 And drinking of the wine was made drunk, and was uncovered in his tent.
22 Which when Cham the father of Chaanan had seen, to wit, that his father's~
nakedness was uncovered, he told it to his two brethren without.
23 But Sem and Japheth put a cloak upon their shoulders, and going backward,~
covered the nakedness of their father: and their faces were turned away, and~
they saw not their father's nakedness.

!Gen 9:24-29
24 And Noe awaking from the wine, when he had learned what his younger son had~
done to him,
25 He said: Cursed be Chaanan, a servant of servants, shall he be unto his~
brethren.
26 And he said: Blessed be the Lord God of Sem, be Chanaan his servant.
27 May God enlarge Japheth, and may he dwell in the tents of Sem, and Chanaan be~
his servant.
28 And Noe lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years:
29 And all his days were in the whole nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.
