From the holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 20:17-28
In that time Jesus going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples apart, and~
said to them: Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be betrayed~
to the chief priests and the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death. And~
so on.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!Bk. v. to Gratian, on Faith, c. ii.
Consider what it was that the mother of Zebedee's children came to Christ~
desiring, with, and for her sons. She was a mother, who, longing for the honour~
of her sons, preferred a request immoderate, and yet pardonable. She was a~
mother who, albeit stricken in years and comfortless, at an age when she had~
sore need of the strength of her offspring to help and keep her, was yet so~
earnest in godliness and motherly love, that she had liefer suffer the loss of~
her sons, that they might gain the reward of following Christ still, as we read~
they had already done, when, at the first call of the Lord, they left their nets~
and their father, (iv. 21, 22.)

She, then, yielding to the intensity of her motherly love, besought the Saviour,~
saying, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one at thy right hand and the~
other at thy left hand, in thy kingdom. Although it was a mistake, it was a~
mistake of love. For a mother's love knoweth no moderation. Yet, although it was a~
greedy prayer, that was a pardonable greed, which hungered, not for riches, but~
for grace. Neither was that request shameless which sought, not her own good,~
but her children's. Remember that she was a mother. Think how that she was a~
mother.

Christ took into His consideration that mother's love of hers, which made her~
sons' reward the comfort of her own old age, and which could bear the loss of~
her loved ones, broken as she was by a mother's yearnings. Consider also that~
she was a woman, that is, of the weaker sex, to which the Lord had not yet given~
strength by His Passion. Consider, I say, that she was an heiress of Eve, and~
weakened by that transmission of the unbridled covetousness of the first woman,~
which the Lord had not yet disarmed by His Blood, even that craving for undue~
dignity, wherewith all our natures are imbued, and which Christ's Bloodshedding~
had not yet washed away. She erred indeed, but the mistake was an inherited~
weakness.

[Ant 2]
Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, * and the Son of man shall be betrayed to be~
crucified.

[Oratio 2]
Look down in mercy upon thy people, O Lord, we beseech thee, and grant unto them,~
whom Thou commandest to abstain from fleshly meats, power to abstain also from~
the corruption of sin.
$Per Dominum

[Ant 3]
For He shall be delivered to the Gentiles, * to mock, and to scourge, and to~
crucify.

[Oratio 3]
God, the Renewer and Lover of innocency, turn the hearts of all thy servants to~
thyself, that so they, being enkindled with the fire of thy Spirit, may be found~
ever rooted in faith, and fruitful in works.

v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 20:17-28
20:17 And Jesus going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples apart, and said to them:
20:18 Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be betrayed to the chief priests and the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death.
20:19 And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked, and scourged, and crucified, and the third day he shall rise again.
20:20 Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee with her sons, adoring and asking something of him.
20:21 Who said to her: What wilt thou? She saith to him: Say that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left, in thy kingdom.
20:22 And Jesus answering, said: You know not what you ask. Can you drink the chalice that I shall drink? They say to him: We can.
20:23 He saith to them: My chalice indeed you shall drink; but to sit on my right or left hand, is not mine to give to you, but to them for whom it is prepared by my Father.
20:24 And the ten hearing it, were moved with indignation against the two brethren.
20:25 But Jesus called them to him, and said: You know that the princes of the Gentiles lord it over them; and they that are the greater, exercise power upon them.
20:26 It shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be the greater among you, let him be your minister:
20:27 And he that will be first among you, shall be your servant.
20:28 Even as the Son of man is not come to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a redemption for many.
