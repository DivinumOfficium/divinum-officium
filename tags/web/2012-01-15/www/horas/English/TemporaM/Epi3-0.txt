Here begins the letter of St Paul to the Galatians
!Gal 1:1-5
1 Paul, an apostle, not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the~
Father, who raised him from the dead,
2 And all the brethren who are with me, to the churches of Galatia.
3 Grace be to you, and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,
4 Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present~
wicked world, according to the will of God and our Father:
5 To whom is glory for ever and ever. Amen.

!Gal 1:6-10
6 I wonder that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace~
of Christ, unto another gospel.
7 Which is not another, only there are some that trouble you, and would pervert~
the gospel of Christ.
8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach a gospel to you besides that~
which we have preached to you, let him be anathema.
9 As we said before, so now I say again: If any one preach to you a gospel,~
besides that which you have received, let him be anathema.
10 For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? If I yet~
pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.

!Gal 1:11-14
11 For I give you to understand, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by~
me is not according to man.
12 For neither did I receive it of man, nor did I learn it; but by the~
revelation of Jesus Christ.
13 For you have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion: how~
that, beyond measure, I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it.
14 And I made progress in the Jews' religion above many of my equals in my own~
nation, being more abundantly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.

From the Exposition of the Epistle to the Galatians by St Austin, Bishop (of~
Hippo.)
!Preface, Bk. iv.
The reason of the Apostle's writing to the Galatians was this that they might~
understand that the grace of God had worked in them that they were no longer~
under the law. For when the grace of the Gospel was preached to them, there had~
not been wanting to them some of them of the circumcision, Christians indeed in~
name, but who had not yet apprehended that great benefit of grace, and desiring~
still to be bound with burdens of the law burdens which the Lord God had laid,~
not upon such as serve righteousness, but upon such as serve sin, laying, that~
is to say, upon the unrighteous a righteous law, whereby their unrighteousness~
was made manifest, not taken away. For there is not anything which taketh away~
sin, save only the grace of faith which worketh by love.

[Lectio5]
The men of the circumcision would have the Galatians, who were under grace, to~
be under the burdens of the law, persuading them that the Gospel profited them~
nothing, unless they should be circumcised, and take on them the other outward~
observances of the Jews' religion. Whence the Galatians began to have doubts of~
the Apostle Paul, by whom the Gospel had been preached to them, as one that held~
not the doctrine of the other Apostles, who compelled the Gentiles to come under~
the law.

[Lectio6]
The same question is discussed in the Epistle to the Romans, but with this~
difference in that case the Apostle putteth an end to the discussion, and~
stilleth the strife which had arisen between the Jewish and the Gentile converts,~
in consequence of the Jews holding that they had earned the knowledge of the~
Gospel as a reward for their observance of the law, and grudging the same~
knowledge to the uncircumcised, as to men who had done nothing to deserve it;~
and the Gentiles, on the contrary, maintaining that they were superior to the~
Jews, in that they were not the murderers of the Lord. Now, in this Epistle to~
the Galatians, the Apostle addresseth himself to those who were troubled by the~
authority claimed by them who were of the circumcision, and sought to bring into~
subjection to the law them who were of the uncircumcision.

From the holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 8:1-13
In that time when Jesus was come down from the mountain, great multitudes~
followed him: And behold a leper came and adored him. And so on.
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Bk. i. Comm. on Matth. viii.
When the Lord was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed Him.~
They were not able to follow Him when He went up. And first there came a leper.~
This poor creature's disease had prevented him from hearing the Saviour's long~
sermon on the Mount. Let it be noted that he is the first person specially named~
as being healed. The second was the Centurion's servant; the third was Peter's~
wife's mother, who was sick of a fever at Capernaum; the fourth were they who~
were brought unto Christ as being troubled with evil spirits, from whom He by~
His word cast out the evil spirits, at the same time that He healed all that~
were sick.

[Lectio8]
And, behold, there came a leper, and worshipped Him, saying Properly after~
preaching and doctrine cometh occasion for a sign, that the power of the miracle~
might confirm in the hearers the truth of the teaching that had gone before.~
Lord, if Thou wilt, Thou canst make me clean. He that prayeth the Lord to have~
the will, doubteth not but that He hath the power. And Jesus put forth His hand,~
and touched him, saying I will; be thou clean. As soon as the Lord put forth~
His Hand the leprosy departed. Let us remark how lowly and unbragging is the~
Lord's language. The leper had said, If Thou wilt; the Lord answereth, I will.~
The leper, Thou canst make me clean, the Lord, Be thou clean. Most Latin~
readers, misled by the identity of form in that language between the Present~
Infinitive Active and the Second Person Singular Present Imperative Passive of~
the Verb, read Christ's answer as if it were, I will to make thee clean. This~
is wrong. The sentences are separate. First cometh the expression of volition, I~
will, then the command, Be thou clean.

[Lectio9]
And Jesus saith unto him See thou tell no man. What need was there to tell~
what his body showed? But go thy way, show thyself to the Priest. There were~
divers reasons why Christ should send him to the Priest. First, for humility's~
sake, that He might show reverence to God's Priest. Then there was a command in~
the law that they that were cleansed of leprosy should make an offering to the~
Priests. Moreover, that, when the Priests saw the leper cleansed, they might~
either believe in the Saviour, or refuse to believe; if they believed, that they~
might be saved, and, if they believed not, that they might have no excuse.~
Lastly, that He might give no ground for the accusation that was so often~
brought against Him, that He was unobservant of the law.

v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 8:1-13
8:1 AND when he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him:
8:2 And behold a leper came and adored him, saying: Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
8:3 And Jesus stretching forth his hand, touched him, saying: I will, be thou made clean. And forthwith his leprosy was cleansed.
8:4 And Jesus saith to him: See thou tell no man: but go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses commanded for a testimony unto them.
8:5 And when he had entered into Capharnaum, there came to him a centurion, beseeching him,
8:6 And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, and is grieviously tormented.
8:7 And Jesus saith to him: I will come and heal him.
8:8 And the centurion making answer, said: Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldst enter under my roof: but only say the word, and my servant shall be healed.
8:9 For I also am a man subject to authority, having under me soldiers; and I say to this, Go, and he goeth, and to another, Come, and he cometh, and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.
8:10 And Jesus hearing this, marvelled; and said to them that followed him: Amen I say to you, I have not found so great faith in Israel.
8:11 And I say to you that many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven:
8:12 But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into the exterior darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
8:13 And Jesus said to the centurion: Go, and as thou hast believed, so be it done to thee. And the servant was healed at the same hour.
