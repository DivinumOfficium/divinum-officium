[Lectio1]
From the Book of Ecclesiasticus
!Sir 4:23-28
23 Son, observe the time, and fly from evil.
24 For thy soul be not ashamed to say the truth.
25 For there is a shame that bringeth sin, and there is a shame that bringeth~
glory and grace.
26 Accept no person against thy own person, nor against thy soul a lie.
27 Reverence not thy neighbour in his fall:
28 And refrain not to speak in the time of salvation. Hide not thy wisdom in her~
beauty.

30 In nowise speak against the truth, but be ashamed of the lie of thy~
ignorance.
31 Be not ashamed to confess thy sins, but submit not thyself to every man for~
sin.
32 Resist not against the face of the mighty, and do not strive against the~
stream of the river

36 Let not thy hand be stretched out to receive, and shut when thou shouldst~
give.
