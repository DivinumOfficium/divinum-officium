Here begins the Acts of Apostles
!Acts 1:1-8
1 The former treatise I made, O Theophilus, of all things which Jesus began to~
do and to teach,
2 Until the day on which, giving commandments by the Holy Ghost to the apostles~
whom he had chosen, he was taken up.
3 To whom also he showed himself alive after his passion, by many proofs, for~
forty days appearing to them, and speaking of the kingdom of God.
4 And eating together with them, he commanded them, that they should not depart~
from Jerusalem, but should wait for the promise of the Father, which you have~
heard (saith he) by my mouth.
5 For John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy~
Ghost, not many days hence.
6 They therefore who were come together, asked him, saying: Lord, wilt thou at~
this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?
7 But he said to them: It is not for you to know the times or moments, which the~
Father hath put in his own power:
8 But you shall receive the power of the Holy Ghost coming upon you, and you~
shall be witnesses unto me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and Samaria, and even~
to the uttermost part of the earth.

!Acts 1:9-14
9 And when he had said these things, while they looked on, he was raised up: and a~
cloud received him out of their sight.
10 And while they were beholding him going up to heaven, behold two men stood by~
them in white garments.
11 Who also said: Ye men of Galilee, why stand you looking up to heaven? This~
Jesus who is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come, as you have seen him~
going into heaven.
12 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount that is called Olivet, which~
is nigh Jerusalem, within a sabbath day's journey.
13 And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode~
Peter and John, James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew,~
James of Alpheus, and Simon Zelotes, and Jude the brother of James.
14 All these were persevering with one mind in prayer with the women, and Mary~
the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren

!Acts 1:15-26
15 In those days Peter rising up in the midst of the brethren, said: (now the~
number of persons together was about an hundred and twenty:)
16 Men, brethren, the scripture must needs be fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost~
spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was the leader of them~
that apprehended Jesus:
17 Who was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.
18 And he indeed hath possessed a field of the reward of iniquity, and being~
hanged, burst asunder in the midst: and all his bowels gushed out.
19 And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem: so that the same~
field was called in their tongue, Haceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.
20 For it is written in the book of Psalms: Let their habitation become desolate,~
and let there be none to dwell therein. And his bishopric let another take.
21 Wherefore of these men who have companied with us all the time that the Lord~
Jesus came in and went out among us,
22 Beginning from the baptism of John, until the day wherein he was taken up~
from us, one of these must be made a witness with us of his resurrection.
23 And they appointed two, Joseph, called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and~
Matthias.
24 And praying, they said: Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, show~
whether of these two thou hast chosen,
25 To take the place of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas hath by~
transgression fallen, that he might go to his own place.
26 And they gave them lots, and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was numbered~
with the eleven apostles.
