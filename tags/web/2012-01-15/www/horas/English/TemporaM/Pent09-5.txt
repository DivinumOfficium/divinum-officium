Lesson from the second book of Kings
!2 Kgs 8:1-3
1 And Eliseus spoke to the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying:~
Arise, and go thou and thy household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst find:~
for the Lord hath exiled a famine, and it shall come upon the land seven years.
2 And she arose, and did according to the word of the man of God: and going with~
her household, she sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.
3 And when the seven years were ended, the woman returned out of the land of the~
Philistines, and she went forth to speak to the king for her house, and for her~
lands.

4 And the king talked with Giezi, the servant of the man of God, saying: Tell me~
all the great things that Eliseus hath done.
5 And when he was telling the king how he had raised one dead to life, the woman~
appeared, whose son he had restored to life, crying to the king for her house,~
and her lands. And Giezi said: My lord O king, this is the woman, and this is~
her son, whom Eliseus raised to life.
6 And the king asked the woman: and she told him. And the king appointed her an~
eunuch, saying: Restore her all that is hers, and all the revenues of the lands,~
from the day that she left the land, to this present.

 Eliseus also came to Damascus, and Benadad king of Syria was sick: and they~
told him, saying: The man of God is come hither.
8 And the king said to Hazael: Take with thee presents, and go to meet the man~
of God, and consult the Lord by him, saying: Can I recover of this my illness?
9 And Hazael went to meet him, taking with him presents, and all the good things~
of Damascus, the burdens of forty camels. And when he stood before him, he said:~
thy son Benadad the king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying: Can I recover of~
this my illness?
10 And Eliseus said to him: Go tell him: Thou shalt recover: bat the Lord hath~
shown me that he shall surely die.
