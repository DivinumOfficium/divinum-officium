O Lord, we beseech thee, absolve thy people from their offences, that through~
thy bountiful goodness we may all be delivered from the bands of those sins,~
which by our frailty we have committed.

From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 9:18-26
At that time While Jesus spake these things unto the multitudes, behold, there~
came a certain ruler, and worshipped Him, saying Lord, my daughter is even now~
dead. And so on.
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Bk. i. Comment, on Matth. ix.
The eighth miracle took place upon the occasion when a certain ruler, desiring~
not to be kept out of the mystery of the true circumcision, besought Christ to~
recall his daughter to life. But a woman, which was diseased with an issue of~
blood, thrust herself in, and her cure occupieth the eighth place, so that the~
resurrection of the ruler's daughter is postponed and made the ninth in~
enumeration even as it is written in the Psalms "Ethiopia shall soon stretch~
forth her hands unto God." (lxvii. 32.) And again " Blindness in part is~
happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles is come in and so all~
Israel shall be saved." (Rom. xi. 25, 26.)

[Lectio8]
And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood, twelve years,~
came behind Him, and touched the hem of His garment." In the Gospel according to~
Luke (viii. 42) it is written that the ruler's daughter was about twelve years~
of age. Note therefore that this woman, who typifies the Gentiles, had been~
diseased for the same time that the Jewish nation, typified by the ruler's~
daughter, had been living in faith. We see not clearly the hideousness of evil,~
until we compare it with good.

[Lectio9]
This woman with the issue of blood came not to the Lord in an house or in a city,~
for such as she were by the Law banished out of cities, (Lev. xv. 25,) but in~
the way, as He walked so that the Lord healed one, even while He was on the~
road to heal another. Whence also the Apostles said It was necessary that the~
word of God should first have been spoken to you but, seeing ye put it from~
you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the~
Gentiles." (Acts xiii. 46.)

[Ant 2]
For she said within herself: * If I may but touch the hem of His garment, I~
shall be whole.

[Versum 2]
V. The Lord reigneth He is clothed with majesty.
R. The Lord is clothed with strength, and hath girded Himself with power.

[Ant 3]
But Jesus turned Him about, * and when He saw her, He said Daughter, be of~
good comfort thy faith hath made thee whole. Alleluia.

[Versum 3]
V. Let my prayer, O Lord, be set forth.
R. As incense before thee.

Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 9:18-26
9:18 And he was speaking these things unto them, behold a certain ruler came up, and adored him, saying: Lord, my daughter is even now dead; but come, lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.
9:19 And Jesus rising up followed him, with his disciples.
9:20 And behold a woman who was troubled with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment.
9:21 For she said within herself: If I shall touch only his garment, I shall be healed.
9:22 But Jesus turning and seeing her, said: Be of good heart, daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.
9:23 And when Jesus was come into the house of the ruler, and saw the minstrels and the multitude making a rout,
9:24 He said: Give place, for the girl is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.
9:25 And when the multitude was put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand. And the maid arose.
9:26 And the fame hereof went abroad into all that country.
