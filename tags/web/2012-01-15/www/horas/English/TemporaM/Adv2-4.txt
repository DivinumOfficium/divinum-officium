Lesson from the book of Isaias
!Isa 19:1-2
1 The burden of Egypt. Behold the Lord will ascend upon a swift cloud, and will~
enter into Egypt, and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence, and the~
heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst thereof.
2 And I will set the Egyptians to fight against the Egyptians: and they shall~
fight brother against brother, and friend against friend, city against city,~
kingdom against kingdom.

!Isa 19:3-6
3 And the spirit of Egypt shall be broken in the bowels thereof, and I will cast~
down their counsel: and they shall consult their idols, and their diviners, and~
their wizards, and soothsayers.
4 And I will deliver Egypt into the hand of cruel masters, and a strong king~
shall rule over them, saith the Lord the God of hosts.
5 And the water of the sea shall be dried up, and the river shall be wasted and~
dry.
6 And the rivers shall fail: the streams of the banks shall be diminished, and~
be dried up. The reed and the bulrush shall wither away.

!Isa 19:11-13
11 The princes of Tanis are become fools, the wise counsellors of Pharao have~
given foolish counsel: how will you say to Pharao: I am the son of the wise, the~
son of ancient kings?
12 Where are now thy wise men? let them tell thee, and shew what the Lord of~
hosts hath purposed upon Egypt.
13 The princes of Tanis are become fools, the princes of Memphis are gone astray,~
they have deceived Egypt, the stay of the people thereof.

am not worthy to unloose.
