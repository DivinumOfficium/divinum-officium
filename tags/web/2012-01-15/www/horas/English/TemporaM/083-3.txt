[Lectio1]
From the Book of Wisdom
!Wis 7:1-6
1 I myself also am a mortal man, like all others, and of the race of him, that~
was first made of the earth, and in the womb of my mother I was fashioned to be~
flesh.
2 In the time of ten months I was compacted in blood, of the seed of man, and~
the pleasure of sleep concurring.
3 And being born I drew in the common air, and fell upon the earth, that is made~
alike, and the first voice which I uttered was crying, as all others do.
4 I was nursed in swaddling clothes, and with great cares.
5 For none of the kings had any other beginning of birth.
6 For all men have one entrance into life, and the like going out.

!Wis 7:7-10
7 Wherefore I wished, and understanding was given me: and I called upon God, and~
the spirit of wisdom came upon me:
8 And I preferred her before kingdoms and thrones, and esteemed riches nothing~
in comparison of her.
9 Neither did I compare unto her any precious stone: for all gold in comparison~
of her, is as a little sand, and silver in respect to her shall be counted as~
clay.
10 I loved her above health and beauty, and chose to have her instead of light:~
for her light cannot be put out.

!Wis 7:11-14
11 Now all good things came to me together with her, and innumerable riches~
through her hands,
12 And I rejoiced in all these: for this wisdom went before me, and I knew not~
that she was the mother of them all.
13 Which I have learned without guile, and communicate without envy, and her~
riches I hide not.
14 For she is an infinite treasure to men! which they that use, become the~
friends of God, being commended for the gift of discipline.
