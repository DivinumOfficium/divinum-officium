From the first book of the Macchabees
!1 Mac  2:49-54
49  Now the days drew near that Mathathias should die, and he said to his sons: Now hath pride and chastisement gotten strength, and the time of destruction, and the wrath of indignation:
50  Now therefore, O my sons, be ye zealous for the law, and give your lives for the covenant of your fathers.
51  And call to remembrance the works of the fathers, which they have done in their generations: and you shall receive great glory, and an everlasting name.
52  Was not Abraham found faithful in temptation, and it was reputed to him unto justice?
53  Joseph in the time of his distress kept the commandment, and he was made lord of Egypt.
54  Phinees our father, by being fervent in the zeal of God, received the covenant of an everlasting priesthood.
