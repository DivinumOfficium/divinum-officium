1 The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to make known to his~
servants the things which must shortly come to pass: and signified, sending by~

keepeth those things which are written in it; for the time is at hand.

dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth, who hath loved us, and washed us~

!Rev 1:12-19
12 And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. And being turned, I saw~
seven golden candlesticks:
13 And in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks, one like to the Son of man,~
clothed with a garment down to the feet, and girt about the paps with a golden~
girdle.
14 And his head and his hairs were white, as white wool, and as snow, and his~
eyes were as a flame of fire,
15 And his feet like unto fine brass, as in a burning furnace. And his voice as~
the sound of many waters.
16 And he had in his right hand seven stars. And from his mouth came out a sharp~
two edged sword: and his face was as the sun shineth in his power.
17 And when I had seen him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right~
hand upon me, saying: Fear not. I am the First and the Last,
18 And alive, and was dead, and behold I am living for ever and ever, and have~
the keys of death and of hell.
19 Write therefore the things which thou hast seen, and which are, and which~
must be done hereafter.

Sermon from Blessed Austin bishop (of Hyppo)
!Sermo 147. de Tempore.
In these holy days of the Lord's resurrection, let us treat as far as we are able, of that gift of the resurrection of the body. For this is our faith, this gift is promised us in the Body of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in him we have the first example. He willed, not only to tell us of our future hope, but to show it to us. He came to the disciples, and they were terrified when they saw him, and supposed that they seen a spirit, yet he gave them proof of the firmness of his body.  

[Responsory4]
R. One of the seven Angels talked with me, saying Come hither, I will show thee~

Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
V. And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain
R. And I saw Jerusalem descending out of heaven, adorned with her jewels.~

Reading 5
He spoke to them, not only with his word for their ears, but also with his form for their eyes. He proved his identity, not only by appearing before them, but also offering himself to be touched and handled, for he said, Why are ye troubled, and why do thoughts arise in your hearts ? Behold my hands and my feet; handle me , and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.

[Responsory5]
R. I heard in heaven the voice of many Angels, saying
* Fear the Lord, and give glory to Him, and worship Him That made heaven and~
earth, the sea, and the fountains of waters. Alleluia, Alleluia.
V. I saw a strong Angel of God fly through the midst of heaven, crying with a~
loud voice and saying

earth, the sea, and the fountains of waters. Alleluia, Alleluia.
&Gloria
R. Fear the Lord, and give glory to Him, and worship Him That made heaven and~
earth, the sea, and the fountains of waters. Alleluia, Alleluia.

[Lectio6]
It is a greater miracle that so many men are born every day, who have not already existed, than that some of them, who do already exist, should rise from the dead, and yet this is not considered a miracle at all, but it is taken for granted. Christ is risen: it is a cetain fact. He was body; he was flesh; he hung on the cross; he gave up the ghost; his flesh was laid in the sepulchre. He who lived in it, showed that flesh to be living. Why are you amazed? Why do you not believe? It is God who has done this.

[Responsory6]
R. Coming from Lebanon how sweet she is, alleluia:
* And the swet smell of her garments, above all aromatical spices, alleluia,~
alleluia.
V. thy lips are as a dropping honeycomb, honey and milk are under thy tongue.
R. And the swet smell of her garments, above all aromatical spices, alleluia,~
alleluia.
&Gloria
R. And the swet smell of her garments, above all aromatical spices, alleluia,~

From the holy Gospel according to John
!John 16:16-22
At that time Jesus said to his disciples:16 A little while, and now you shall~
not see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me: because I go to the~
Father. And so on.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!Tract 101 of John.)
This little while is the whole duration of this present world. In the same sense~
this same Evangelist saith in his Epistle (ii. 18), It is the last time. The~
words, because I go to the Father, refer to the first clause of the text, namely, A~
little while and ye shall not see Me, and not to the latter clause, that is,~
and again a little while, and ye shall see Me. By His going to the Father He was~
about to bring it to pass that they should see Him no more. And thus it was that~
He said, not that He was about to die, and that after His death they should not~
see Him until He rose again, but that He was going to the Father, which He did~
when, after that He was risen again and had manifested Himself to them for forty~
days, He ascended up into heaven.

[Responsory7]
R. The people of Israel sung: Alleluia and all the multitude of Jacob sung in~
measure.
* And David [was with the singers, (and) played upon an harp in the house of the~
Lord, and sung praises unto God. Alleluia, Alleluia.
V. So the Priests and the Levites were sanctified, and all Israel brought up the~
ark of the covenant of the Lord with shouting.
R. And David [was with the singers, (and) played upon an harp in the house of~
the Lord, and sung praises unto God. Alleluia, Alleluia.
&Gloria
R. And David [was with the singers, (and) played upon an harp in the house of~
the Lord, and sung praises unto God. Alleluia, Alleluia.

[Lectio8]
But now, to them which were looking on Him in the Body, He saith, A little while,~
and ye shall not see Me, a little while, and they who now saw Him clad in a~
dying nature, should see Him so no more, because He was about to go to the~
Father. But He saith : And again a little while, and ye shall see Me, and these~
words are a promise to the Universal Church, just as are those others : Lo, I~
am with you alway, even unto the end of the world (Matth. xxviii. 20.) Our Lord~
delayeth not His promised coming. Again a little while, and we shall see Him. We~
shall see Him. And, 0, when we shall see Him, then we shall beg, we shall ask no~
more; for no desire will be unsatisfied, and no riddle unsolved.

[Responsory8]
R. Your sorrow, alleluia,
* Shall be turned into joy. Alleluia
V. The world shall rejoice; and you shall be made sorrowful: but your sorrow
R. Shall be turned into joy. alleluia
&Gloria
R. Shall be turned into joy. alleluia

[Lectio9]
This little while seemeth a very long while to us now, while as it is still~
going on, but when it is over we shall feel indeed how truly it is but a little~
while. Therefore, may our rejoicing never be like the rejoicing of that world~
whereof it is said: The world shall rejoice. A woman when she is in travail~
hath sorrow, and yet, while hitherto our gladness is still coming to the birth~
through throes of sorrow, let us not be altogether sorrowful, but, as the~
Apostle hath it (Rom. xii. 12) : Rejoicing in hope : patient in tribulation. A~
woman, when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come : but as~
soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for~
joy that a man is born into the world. And so will it be with us. And with that~
let me end my discourse. The next passage is one of extreme difficulty; nor is~
it possible to treat it briefly, if, (with the will of God,) it is to be treated~
satisfactorily.

[Responsory9]
R. I saw Jerusalem coming down out of heaven, adorned with pure gold, and~
garnished with precious stones.
* Alleluia, Alleluia.
V. The building of the wall of it was of jasper and the city was pure gold,~

R. Alleluia, Alleluia.
&Gloria

v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 16:16-22
16:16 A little while, and now you shall not see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me: because I go to the Father.
16:17 Then some of the disciples said one to another: What is this that he saith to us: A little while, and you shall not see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me, and, because I go to the Father?
16:18 They said therefore: What is this that he saith, A little while? we know not what he speaketh.
16:19 And Jesus knew that they had a mind to ask him; and he said to them: Of this do you inquire among yourselves, because I said: A little while, and you shall not see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me?
16:20 Amen, amen I say to you, that you shall lament and weep, but the world shall rejoice; and you shall be made sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.
16:21 A woman, when she is in labour, hath sorrow, because her hour is come; but when she hath brought forth the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.
16:22 So also you now indeed have sorrow; but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice; and your joy no man shall take from you.
