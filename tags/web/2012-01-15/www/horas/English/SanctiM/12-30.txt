[Lectio1]
From the letter of blessed Apostle Paul to the Romans
!Rom 2:1-4
1 Wherefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest. For wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself. For thou dost the same things which thou judgest. 
2 For we know that the judgment of God is, according to truth, against them that do such things. 
3 And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them who do such things, and dost the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God? 
4 Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and patience, and longsuffering? Knowest thou not, that the benignity of God leadeth thee to penance?

!Rom 2:5-8
5 But according to thy hardness and impenitent heart, thou treasurest up to thyself wrath, against the day of wrath, and revelation of the just judgment of God.
6 Who will render to every man according to his works. 
7 To them indeed, who according to patience in good work, seek glory and honour and incorruption, eternal life: 
8 But to them that are contentious, and who obey not the truth, but give credit to iniquity, wrath and indignation

[Lectio3]
!Rom 2:9-13
9 Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that worketh evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek. 
10 But glory, and honour, and peace to every one that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
11 For there is no respect of persons with God. 
12 For whosoever have sinned without the law, shall perish without the law; and whosoever have sinned in the law, shall be judged by the law. 
13 For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.
