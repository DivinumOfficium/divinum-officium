[Lectio1]
!Rom 16:1-5
1 And I commend to you Phebe, our sister, who is in the ministry of the church,~
that is in Cenchrae:
2 That you receive her in the Lord as becometh saints; and that you assist her~
in whatsoever business she shall have need of you. For she also hath assisted~
many, and myself also.
3 Salute Prisca and Aquila, my helpers in Christ Jesus,
4 Who have for my life laid down their own necks: to whom not I only give~
thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles,
5 And the church which is in their house. Salute Epenetus, my beloved: who is~
the firstfruits of Asia in Christ.

[Lectio2]
!Rom 16:17-19
17 Now I beseech you, brethren, to mark them who make dissensions and offences~
contrary to the doctrine which you have learned, and avoid them.
18 For they that are such, serve not Christ our Lord, but their own belly; and~
by pleasing speeches and good words, seduce the hearts of the innocent.
19 For your obedience is published in every place. I rejoice therefore in you.~
But I would have you to be wise in good, and simple in evil.
