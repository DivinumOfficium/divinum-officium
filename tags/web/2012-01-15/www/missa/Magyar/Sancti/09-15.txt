[Lectio]
Olvasmány Judit könyvébõl
!Jdt 13:22; 13:25
Mindnyájan pedig imádván az Urat, mondák neki: Az Úr megáldott téged az õ erejével, mert általad semmivé tette ellenségeinket. Mert ma a te nevedet úgy felmagasztalta, hogy el nem távozik dicséreted az emberek szájától, kik megemlékeznek az Úr erejérõl mindörökké; mivelhogy nem kimélted éltedet a te nemzetséged szorongatásaért és sanyarúságaért, hanem elejét vetted a romlásnak a mi Istenünk színe elõtt.

[Sequentia]
At the Cross her station keeping,
Stood the mournful Mother weeping,
Close to Jesus to the last.
_
Through her heart, His sorrow sharing,
All His bitter anguish bearing
Now at length the sword had passed.
_
Oh, how sad and sore distressed
Was that Mother highly blessed
Of the sole begotten One!
_
Christ above in torment hangs,
She beneath beholds the pangs
Of her dying, glorious Son.
_
Is there one who would not weep
‘Whelmed in miseries so deep
Christ’s dear Mother’s pain untold.
_
Can the human heart refrain
From partaking in her pain,
In that Mother’s pain untold?
_
Bruised, derided, cursed, defiled,
She beheld her tender Child,
All with bloody scourges rent.
_
For the sins of His own nation
Saw Him hang in desolation
Till His spirit forth He sent.
_
O sweet Mother! fount of love,
Touch my spirit from above,
Make my heart with yours accord.
_
Make me feel as you have felt;
Make my soul to glow and melt
With the love of Christ, my Lord.
_
Holy Mother, pierce me through,
In my heart each wound renew
Of my Savior crucified.
_
Let me share with you His pain,
Who for all our sins was slain,
Who for me in torments died.
_
Mix’d with yours let my tears be,
Mourning Him Who mourned for me,
All the days that I may live.
_
By the Cross with you to stay,
There with you to weep and pray,
Is all I ask of you to give.
_
Virgin of all virgins blest!
Listen to my fond request:
Let me share that grief of yours.
_
Let me, to my latest breath,
In my body bear the death
Of that dying Son of yours.
_
Wounded with His every wound,
Steep my soul till it has swooned
In His very Blood away.
_
Be to me, O Virgin, nigh,
Lest in flames I burn and die,
In this awful judgment day.
_
Christ, when You shall call me hence,
Be Your Mother my defense,
Be Your Cross my victory.
_
While my body here decays,
May my soul Your goodness praise,
Safe in heaven eternally.
Amen. Alleluia.

Attól az órától fogva házába fogadta a tanítvány.
