Lesson from the first letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians
!1 Cor. 4:9-14
Brethren: We have been made a spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men. We are fools for Christ, but you are wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are honored, but we are without honor! To this very hour we hunger and thirst, and we are naked and buffeted, and have no fixed abode. And we toil, working with our own hands. We are reviled and we bless, we are persecuted and we bear with it, we are maligned and we entreat, we have become as the refuse of this world, the offscouring of all, even until now! I write these things not to put you to shame, but to admonish you as my dearest children, in Christ Jesus our Lord.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 10:1-9
At that time, the Lord appointed seventy-two others, and sent them forth two by~
two before Him into every town and place where He Himself was about to come. And~
He said to them, The harvest indeed is, great, but the laborers are few. Pray~
therefore the Lord of the harvest to send forth laborers into His harvest. Go.~
Behold, I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves. Carry neither purse,~
nor wallet, nor sandals, and greet no one on the way. Whatever house you enter,~
first say, ‘Peace to this house!’ And if a son of peace be there, your peace~
will rest upon him; but if not, it will return to you. And remain in the same~
house, eating and drinking what they have; for the laborer deserves his wages.~
Do not go from house to house. And whatever town you enter, and they receive you,~
eat what is set before you, and cure the sick who are there, and day to them,~
‘The kingdom of God is at hand for you.’

[Offertorium]
!Ps 20:2-3
O Lord, in Your strength the just man is glad; in Your victory how greatly he~
rejoices! You have granted him his heart’s desire.

Grant us, we beseech You, almighty God, that the offering of our lowliness may~
be pleasing to You in honor of Your Saints and may purify us in both body and~
mind.
