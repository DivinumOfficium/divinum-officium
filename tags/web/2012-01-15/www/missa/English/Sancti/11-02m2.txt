Lesson from the second book of Machabees
!2 Mach. 12:43-46
In those days: The most valiant man Judas, making a gathering, sent twelve thousand drachmas of silver to Jerusalem for sacrifice to be offered for the sins of the dead, thinking well and religiously concerning the resurrection, for if he had not hoped that they that were slain should rise again, it would have seemed superfluous and vain to pray for the dead; and because he considered that they who had fallen asleep with godliness, had great grace laid up for them. It is therefore a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the dead, that they may be loosed from sins.

[Graduale]
!4 Esd. 2:34-35
Eternal rest give to them, O Lord; and let perpetual light shine upon them.
!Ps 111:7
V. The just man shall be in everlasting remembrance; an evil report he shall not~
fear.
!Tractus
O Lord, absolve the souls of all the faithful departed from every bond of sin.
V. And by the help of Your grace may they be worthy to escape the sentence of~
vengeance.
V. And to enjoy all the beatitude of the light eternal.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 6:37-40
At that time, Jesus said to the multitude of the Jews, All that the Father gives~
to Me shall come to Me, and him who comes to Me I will not cast out. For I have~
come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him Who sent Me.~
Now this is the will of Him Who sent Me, the Father, that I should lose nothing~
of what He has given Me, but that I should raise it up on the last day. For this~
is the will of My Father Who sent Me, that whoever beholds the Son, and believes~
in Him, shall have everlasting life, and I will raise him up on the last day.

[Offertorium]
!  
O Lord, Jesus Christ, King of glory, deliver the souls of all the faithful~
departed from the pains of hell and the deep pit; deliver them from the lion's~
mouth, that hell engulf them not, nor they fall into darkness, but that Michael,~
the holy standard-bearer, bring them into the holy light
v. which You once promised to Abraham and his seed.
V. We offer You, O Lord, sacrifices and prayers of praise; accept them for those~
souls whom we this day commemorate; grant them, O Lord, to pass from death to~
the life
v. which You once promised to Abraham and his seed.

[Secreta]
O Lord, be pleased to accept our humble prayers for the souls of Your servants~
and handmaids, in whose behalf we offer You the sacrifice of praise that You may~
mercifully admit them into the fellowship of Your Saints.

[Communio]
!4 Esd 2:35; 2:34

with Your Saints forever, for You are kind.

[Postcommunio]
Grant, we beseech You, O Lord, that the souls of Your servants and handmaids,~
cleansed by these sacrifices, may obtain both forgiveness and eternal rest.
