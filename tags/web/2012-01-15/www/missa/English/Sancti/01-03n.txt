[Lectio]
Lesson from the Acts of Apostles
!Acts 4:8 - 12.
In those days, Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said, Rulers of the people and elders, if we are on trial today about a good work done to a cripple, as to how this man has been cured, be it known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that in the Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, Whom you crucified, Whom God has raised from the dead, even in this Name does he stand here before you, sound. This is ‘The stone that was rejected by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone.’ Neither is there salvation in any other. For there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved.
