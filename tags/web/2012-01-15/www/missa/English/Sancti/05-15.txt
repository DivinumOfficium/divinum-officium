Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus
!Eccli 31:8-11
Happy the man found without fault, who turns not aside after gain, nor puts his trust in money nor in treasures! Who is he, that we may praise him? For he has done wonders in his life. He has been tested by gold and come off safe, and this remains his glory forever; he could have sinned but did not, could have done evil but would not, so that his possessions are secure in the Lord, and the assembly of the Saints shall recount his alms.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 18:1-5
At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is the greatest in~
the kingdom of heaven? And Jesus called a little child to him, set him their~
midst, and said, Amen I say to you, unless you turn and become like little~
children, you will not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whoever, therefore,~
humbles himself as this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of~
heaven. And whoever receives one such little child for My sake, receives Me.
