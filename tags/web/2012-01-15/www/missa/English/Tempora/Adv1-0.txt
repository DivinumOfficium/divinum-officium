[Lectio]
Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Romans
!Rom 13:11-14
Brethren: Understand, for it is now the hour for us to rise from sleep, because now our salvation is nearer than when we came to believe. The night is far advanced; the day is at hand. Let us therefore lay aside the works of darkness, and put on the armor of light. Let us walk becomingly as in the day, not in revelry and drunkenness, not in debauchery and wantonness, not in strife and jealousy. But put on the Lord Jesus Christ.

[Graduale]
!Ps 24:3-4
No one who waits for You shall be put to shame.
V. Your ways, O Lord, make known to me; teach me Your paths. Alleluia, alleluia.
!Ps 84:8
V. Show us, O Lord, Your kindness, and grant us Your salvation. Alleluia.

[GradualeF]
!Ps 24:3-4
No one who waits for You shall be put to shame.
V. Your ways, O Lord, make known to me; teach me Your paths. 

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 21:25-33
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples: There will be signs in the sun and~
moon and stars, and upon the earth distress of nations bewildered by the roaring~
of sea and waves; men fainting for fear and for expectation of the things that~
are coming on the world; for the powers of heaven will be shaken. And then they~
will see the son of Man coming upon a cloud with great power and majesty. but~
when these things begin to come to pass, look up, and lift up your heads,~
because your redemption is at hand. And He spoke to them a parable. Behold the~
fig tree, and all the trees. When they now put forth their buds, you know that~
summer is near. Even so, when you see these things coming to pass, know that the~
kingdom of God is near. Amen I say to you, this generation will not pass away~
till all things have been accomplished. Heaven and earth will pass away, but My~
words will not pass away.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 24:1-3
To You I lift up my soul: in You, O my God, I trust; let me not be put to shame;~
let not my enemies exult over me. No one who waits for You shall be put to~
shame.

[Secreta]
May these offerings, O Lord, cleanse us by their mighty power and thus make us~
come purer before You Who are their author.
