Lesson from the Acts of Apostles
!Acts 10:34, 42-48.
In those days, Peter opening his mouth, said, Men, brethren, the Lord charged us to preach to the people and to testify that He it is Who has been appointed by God to be judge of the living and of the dead. To Him all the prophets bear witness, that through His Name all who believe in Him may receive forgiveness of sins. While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came upon all who were listening to his message. And the faithful of the circumcision, who had come with Peter, were amazed, because on the Gentiles also the grace of the Holy Spirit had been poured forth; for they heard them speaking in tongues and magnifying God. Then Peter answered, Can anyone refuse the water to baptize these, seeing that they have received the Holy Spirit just as we did? And he ordered them to be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 3:16-21.
At that time, Jesus said to Nicodemus: God so love the world that He gave His~
only-begotten Son, that those who believe in Him may not perish, but may have~
life everlasting. For God did not send His Son into the world in order to judge~
the world, but that the world might be save through Him. He who believes in Him~
is not judged; but he who does not believe in Him is already judged, because he~
does not believe in the Name of the only-begotten Son of God. Now this is the~
judgment: The light has come into the world, yet men have loved the darkness~
rather than the light, for their works were evil. For everyone who does evil~
hates the light, and does not come to the light, that his deeds may not be~
exposed. But he who does the truth comes to the light that his deeds may be made~
manifest, for they have been performed in God.
