[Lectio]
Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians
!Eph. 4:7-13.
Brethren: To each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ’s bestowal. Thus it says, Ascending on high, He led away captives; He gave gifts to men. Now this, He ascended, what does it mean but that He also first descended into the lower parts of the earth? He Who descended, He it is Who ascended also above all the heavens, that He might fill all things. And He Himself gave some men as apostles, and some as prophets, others again as evangelists, and others as pastors and teachers, in order to perfect the saints for a work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the deep knowledge of the Son of God, to perfect manhood, to the mature measure of the fullness of Christ.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 17:1-11.
At that time, raising His eyes to heaven, Jesus said, Father, the hour has come!~
Glorify Your Son, that Your Son may glorify You, even as You have given Him~
power over all flesh, in order that to all You have given Him He may give~
everlasting life. Now this is everlasting life, that they may know You, the only~
true God, and Him Whom You have sent, Jesus Christ. I have glorified You on~
earth; I have accomplished the work that You have given Me to do. And now You,~
Father, glorify Me with Yourself, with the glory that I had with You before the~
world existed. I have manifested Your name to the men whom You have given Me out~
of the world. They were Yours, and You have given them to Me, and they have kept~
Your word. Now they have learnt that whatever You have given Me is from You;~
because the words that You have given Me I have given to them. And they have~
received them, and have known of a truth that I came forth from You, and they~
have believed that You did send Me. I pray for them; not for the world do I pray,~
but for those whom You have given Me, because they are Yours; and all things~
that are Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine; and I am glorified in them. And I~
am no longer in the world, but these are in the world, and I am coming to You.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 65:8-9, 20.
Bless the Lord our God, you peoples, loudly sound His praise; He has given life~
to my soul, and has not let my feet slip. Blessed be the Lord, Who refused me~
not my prayer, or His kindness. Alleluia.

[Secreta]
Accept, O Lord, the prayers and gifts of Your faithful people, that, through~
these rites of love and devotion we may pass to the glory of heaven.
