[Oratio]
O God, who, by the preaching and the blood of your holy Martyrs, Isaac, John, and their companions, consecrated the first fruits of the faith in the vast areas of North America, mercifully grant that, through their intercession, the fruitful harvest of Christians may everywhere increase day by day.

[Lectio94]
Among the members of the Society of Jesus who brought very much renown to the infant Church in North America in the middle of the seventeenth century by laboring under the greatest hardships in the mission of New France, God chose as victims eight men of outstanding integrity, who sacrificed their lives in what is now the State of New York and the Province of Ontario, Canada. John de Brebeuf and Isaac Jogues are regarded as their leaders and masters, for they were valiant men, fired with apostolic zeal, living most mortified lives, in intimate prayerful union with God. Not unlike them in virtue were the priests: Anthony Daniel, Gabriel Lalemant, Charles Garnier and Noel Chabanel; also the lay coadjutors of the Society of Jesus, Rene Goupil and John Lalande. All these crowned a life  of martyrdom lived among the savage Huron tribes with a cruel death for the same reason - their faith - although not at the same time and place. Some of them, however, suffered incredible torture with such fortitude as to excite even the admiration of the savages themselves. All these were beatified by Pius XI and shortly afterwards, when they became famous for miracles, the same Pontiff canonized them.
