Lesson from the book of Wisdom
!Wis 10:10:14
The Lord guided the just in direct ways, showed him the kingdom of God, and gave him knowledge of holy things; He prospered him in his labors and made abundant the fruit of his works, stood by him against the greed of his defrauders, and enriched him; He preserved him from foes, and secured him against ambush, and He gave him the prize for his stern struggle that he might recognize that devotion to God is mightier than all else. He did not abandon the just man when he was sold, but delivered him from sin. He went down with him into the dungeon, and did not desert him in his bonds, until He brought him the scepter of royalty and authority over his oppressors, and showed those who had defamed him false; and the Lord our God gave him eternal glory.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 19:12-26
At that time, Jesus spoke this parable to His disciples: A certain nobleman went~
into a far country to obtain for himself a kingdom and then return. And having~
summoned ten of his servants, he gave them ten gold pieces and said to them,~
‘Trade till I come.’ But his citizens hated him; and they sent a delegation~
after him to say, ‘We do not wish this man to be king over us.’ And it came to~
pass when he had returned, after receiving the kingdom, that he ordered the~
servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him in order that he~
might learn how much each one had made by trading. And the first came, saying,~
‘Lord, your gold piece has earned ten gold pieces.’ And he said to him, ‘Well~
done, good servant; because you have been faithful in a very little, you shall~
have authority over ten towns.’ Then the second came, saying, ‘Lord, your gold~
piece has made five gold pieces.’ And he said to him, ‘Be you also over five~
towns.’ And another came, saying, ‘Lord, behold your gold piece, which I have~
kept laid up in a napkin; for I feared you, because you are a stern man. You~
take up what you did not sow.’ He said to him, ‘Out of your own mouth I judge~
you, you wicked servant. You knew that I am a stern man, taking up what I did~
not lay down and reaping what I did not sow. Why, then, did you not put my money~
in a bank, so that I on my return might have gotten it with interest?’ And he~
said to the bystanders, ‘Take away the gold piece from him, and give it to him~
who has the ten gold pieces.’ But they said to him, ‘Lord, he has ten gold~
pieces.’ I say to you that to everyone who has shall be given; but from him who~
does not have, even that which he has shall be taken away.

My faithfulness and My kindness shall be with him, and through My name shall his~
horn be exalted. (Alleluia.)

spurning the delights of the world, labored earnestly to please Christ, the only~
King, so may his prayer make us pleasing to You.
