141:1 I cried to the Lord with my voice: * with my voice I made supplication to the Lord.
141:2 In his sight I pour out my prayer, * and before him I declare my trouble:
141:3 When my spirit failed me, * then thou knewest my paths.
141:4 In this way wherein I walked, * they have hidden a snare for me.
141:5 I looked on my right hand, and beheld, * and there was no one that would know me.
141:6 Flight hath failed me: * and there is no one that hath regard to my soul.
141:7 I cried to thee, O Lord: * I said: Thou art my hope, my portion in the land of the living.
141:8 Attend to my supplication: * for I am brought very low.
141:9 Deliver me from my persecutors; * for they are stronger than I.
141:10 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: * the just wait for me, until thou reward me.
