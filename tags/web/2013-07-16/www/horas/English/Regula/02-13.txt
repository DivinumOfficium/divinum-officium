02-13# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 11: How Night Office Is to Be Said On Lord’s Days
_
On the Lord’s day let there be somewhat earlier rising for night office, in which night office let this arrangement be kept: that is, when the six psalms as we assigned above have been sung and the versicle, all sitting down arranged in order in the stalls let four lections be read from the book as we said above with their responsories, when only in the fourth responsory let the singer recite the Gloria; and when he begins it at once let all rise with reverence.

After these lections let there follow six other psalms, in order, with antiphons in the same manner as before and a versicle. After these again let other four lections be read with their responsories, in the same order as above. After these let there follow three canticles from the prophets, appointed by the abbot; and let these canticles be sung with Alleluia. When the versicle also has been recited, the abbot asking a blessing, let another four lections be read from the New Testament in the same manner as above. But after the fourth responsory let the abbot begin the hymn “Te Deum laudamus”: and this being completed, let the abbot read a lection from the Gospel, all standing in honour and respect. The reading finished, let all answer Amen, and then let the abbot follow on with the hymn “Te decet laus”; and the benediction given, let them begin Lauds. And let this order of night office be observed on Lord’s days at all times, summer and winter alike, unless haply the rising be delayed too late, which be far from us, for then there must be some abbreviation of the lections or of the responsories. However, let every precaution be taken that this may not take place: but if it should happen, let fitting satisfaction for it be offered to God in the oratory by him through whose neglect it came to pass.
