69:1 (Unto the end, a psalm for David, to bring to remembrance that the Lord saved him.)
69:2 O God, come to my assistance; O Lord, make haste to help me.
69:3 Let them be confounded and ashamed that seek my soul:
69:4 Let them be turned backward, and blush for shame that desire evils to me: Let them be presently turned away blushing for shame that say to me: 'Tis well, 'tis well.
69:5 Let all that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee; and let such as love thy salvation say always: The Lord be magnified.
69:6 But I am needy and poor; O God, help me. Thou art my helper and my deliverer: O lord, make no delay.
