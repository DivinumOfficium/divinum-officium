[Oratio]
O God, Who dost gladden us by the yearly Feast-day of thine holy Martyrs~
Cyriacus, Largus, and Smaragdus, mercifully grant unto us who keep their~
birth-day, the strength to imitate their patience under suffering.
$Per Dominum

[Lectio4]
Cyriacus the Deacon was long kept in prison with Sisinius, Largus, and Smaragdus,~
and wrought many wonderful works. Among other things he by his prayers freed~
from a devil Arthemia, a daughter of Diocletian, and, being sent to Sapor, King~
of the Persians, also delivered his daughter Jobia from a foul spirit. He~
baptized the king, her father, and four hundred and thirty others, and~
afterwards returned to Rome. He was arrested by command of the Emperor Maximian,~
and dragged in chains before his chariot. Then after four days he was brought~
forth from prison, had boiling pitch poured upon him, was stretched on a block,~
~(and belaboured with a cudgel,) and at last was slain with the axe, along with~
Largus, Smaragdus, and twenty others, at the gardens of Sallust, on the Salarian~
Way. On this Way were their bodies buried by John the Priest, on the 16th day~
of March, (in the year of our Lord 303,) but afterwards, on the 8th of August,~
Pope Marcellus and the noble lady Lucina took them and wrapped them in linen,~
and embalmed them with costly ointments, and carried them to the farm belonging~
to the said lady Lucina, at the seventh milestone from Rome on the road to~
Ostia.

From the Sermon S. John Chrysostom
!Serm. 1. de Mart, tom. 3.
Every man knoweth how, by the good Providence of God, the divers glories of His~
Martyrs are held in such esteem by His people, that the same His Saints in all~
places receive worthy honour, and before us is set, by the favour of Christ, the~
noble ensample of their courage: thus are we stirred up to consider, on the~
occasion of these Holidays, how great glory doth abide them in heaven, whose~
birthdays are thus kept upon earth: thereby, also, we are roused to strive to be~
like them, brave, godly, and true: so that, in the strength of Christ, we, like~
them, may wrestle with, and conquer our enemy, and, when we have gained the same~
victory that they gained, may with them at last be glorified in the kingdom of~
heaven.

[Lectio6]
For what man is there willing to share their reward, that if he do not first lay~
hold on their steadfastness, follow after the ensample of their faith, and~
imitate their brave patience, can either seek or find their glory by likeness to~
their lives? But whosoever doth so follow them, let him not doubt but that,~
though in very deed he gain not the crown of martyrdom, he is yet able by good~
works to make himself meet therefor. For we have a most merciful God, Which~
either giveth Martyrdom unto such as be willing, or, without Martyrdom, doth~
make them joint heirs with the Saints in the kingdom of God.

From the holy Gospel according to Mark
!Mark 16:15-18
Abban az idõben így szolt Jézus tanitványaihoz: Menjetek el az egész világra, és~
hirdessétek az evangéliumot minden teremtménynek. És így tovább.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great.) 
!29th on the Gospels.
By the words every~
creature we may understand every tribe of the Gentiles. Of aforetime it had been~
said, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, (Matth. x. 5,) but now, Preach the~
Gospel to every creature, that, since the Jews had proudly rejected the~
preaching of the Apostles, that might become our gain which was the seal of~
their condemnation. But when the Eternal Truth sendeth forth His disciples to~
preach, what doth He but scatter seed over the field of the world He scattered~
abroad a few grains for seed, that He may afterward reap an abundant harvest in~
our faith.

[Lectio8]
The great harvest of faithful souls throughout the whole world would never have~
sprung up, if the hand of the Lord had not first scattered those chosen grains~
of preachers over the reasonable soil of men's minds. Then is written, He that~
believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be~
damned. Now, perchance, thou sayest in thine heart I believe, and therefore I~
shall be saved. True, if to thy faith thou dost add works. He only hath a living~
faith whose life doth not give the lie to his profession. It is of this that~
Paul speaketh, where he saith of certain vain believers, They profess that they~
know God but in works they deny Him. (Tit. i. 16.)

[Lectio9]
And these signs shall follow them that believe In My name they shall cast out~
devils, they shall speak with new tongues, they shall take up serpents and if~
they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on~
the sick, and they shall recover. My brethren, these signs do not follow us. Do~
we, then, not believe Nay. The truth is, these things were needful when the~
Church was young. That she might grow by the increase of the faithful, she~
needed to be nourished with miracles. So we, when we plant a young tree,~
continually water and tend it, till we see that it hath taken firm root in the~
earth but when once it hath taken firm root, it can grow of itself. Hence Paul~
saith of tongues Tongues are for a sign not to them that believe, but to them~
that believe not. ( Cor. xiv. 22.)
