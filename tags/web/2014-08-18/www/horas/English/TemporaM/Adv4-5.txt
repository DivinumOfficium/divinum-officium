Lesson from the book of Isaias
!Isa 66:5-8
5 Hear the word of the Lord, you that tremble at his word: Your brethren that~
hate you, and cast you out for my name's sake, have said: Let the Lord be~
glorified, and we shall see in your joy: but they shall be confounded.
6 A voice of the people from the city, a voice from the temple, the voice of the~
Lord that rendereth recompense to his enemies.
7 Before she was in labour, she brought forth; before her time came to be~
delivered, she brought forth a man child.
8 Who hath ever heard such a thing? and who hath seen the like to this? shall~
the earth bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be brought forth at once,~
because Sion hath been in labour, and hath brought forth her children?

!Isa 66:9-12
9 Shall not I that make others to bring forth children, myself bring forth,~
saith the Lord? shall I, that give generation to others, be barren, saith the~
Lord thy God?
10 Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all you that love her: rejoice~
for joy with her, all you that mourn for her.
11 That you may suck, and be filled with the breasts of her consolations: that~
you may milk out, and flow with delights, from the abundance of her glory.
12 For thus saith the Lord: Behold I will bring upon her as it were a river of~
peace, and as an overflowing torrent the glory of the Gentiles, which you shall~
suck; you shall be carried at the breasts, end upon the knees they shall caress~
you.

!Isa 66:13-18
13 As one whom the mother caresseth, so will I comfort you, and you shall be~
comforted in Jerusalem.
14 You shah see and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like~
an herb, and the hand of the Lord shall be known to his servants, and he shall~
be angry with his enemies.
15 For behold the Lord will come with fire, and his chariots are like a~
whirlwind, to render his wrath in indignation, and his rebuke with flames of~
fire.
16 For the Lord shall judge by fire, and by his sword unto all flesh, and the~
slain of the Lord shall be many.
17 They that were sanctified, and thought themselves clean in the gardens behind~
the gate within, they that did eat swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the~
mouse: they shall be consumed together, saith the Lord.
18 But I know their works, and their thoughts: I come that I may gather them~
together with all nations and tongues: and they shall come and shall see my~
glory.
