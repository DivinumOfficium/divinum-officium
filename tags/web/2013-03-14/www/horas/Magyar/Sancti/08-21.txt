[Oratio]
O Almighty and merciful God, Who didst enkindle the love of thyself in the~
blessed Jeanne Frances, Who didst give unto her the grace to make every path of~
life temporal the straight and narrow way which leadeth unto life eternal, and~
Who wast pleased to use her as a mean whereby to adorn thy Church with a new~
sisterhood, grant unto us for that thine handmaid's sake, and at her prayers,~
that we who know that we have no strength as of ourselves to help ourselves, and~
therefore do put all our trust in thine Almighty power, may by the assistance of~
thy heavenly grace, always prevail in all things against whatsoever shall arise~
to fight against us.
$Per Dominum

[Lectio4]
Jeanne Frances Fremiot de Chantal was born of parents of the highest rank, at~
Dijon in Burgundy, (on the 23rd day of January, in the year 1575.) From her~
earliest childhood she gave no dark promise of a life of eminent holiness. It is~
said that when she was scarcely fifteen years of age she confuted with~
precocious acuteness a Presbyterian nobleman, and when he gave her a little~
present she put it in the fire, saying That is how heretics will burn in hell~
for not believing Christ when He speaketh. On the death of her mother, she~
placed herself under the keeping of the Virgin Mother of God, and discharged a~
maid who strove to beguile her into loving the world. She had nothing youthful~
about her ways. She shrank from the pleasures of life. She had a strong wish~
that she might die a martyr. She devoted herself unweariedly to religion and~
godliness. Her father gave her in marriage, (at twenty years of age,) to the~
Baron de Chantal, and she strove to excel in all the duties and graces of a~
wife. She made it her work to see that her children, her servants, and all~
others under her authority were taught the doctrines of the faith and the~
practice of good living. She relieved the sufferings of the poor by plentiful~
almsgiving, for which purposes God not unfrequently miraculously multiplied her~
money. And so it came to pass that no one ever asked her for food in Christ's~
name and was refused it.

[Lectio5]
When her husband was accidentally killed out shooting, and in her widowhood she~
determined to embrace the more excellent way, and took a vow not to marry again.~
She bore her bereavement with resignation to the Will of God, and so far~
overcame her horror of the gentleman who had fired the shot, that, to show she~
attributed no blame to him, she stood god-mother to his little boy. She was~
quite content with few servants and plain cookery and dress, and sold her rich~
wardrobe for the benefit of charities. She received offers of second marriage~
which would have been both politic and honourable, but never was induced to~
accept one of them, and to harden herself in her intention of remaining in her~
widowhood, she renewed her vow to that effect, and branded on her chest with a~
hot iron the most holy name of Jesus Christ. Her love grew tenderer every day,~
and she had brought to her the starving, the abandoned, the diseased, and those~
who were afflicted with the most sickening disorders. Them she not only~
sheltered, comforted, and nursed, but washed and mended their filthy and ragged~
garments, and shrank not from putting her mouth to their sores oozing with~
disgusting matter. Whatever of her time was not taken up by her household duties~
she spent in prayer, reading godly books, and working.

[Lectio6]
She used the services of St Francis de Sales as her spiritual adviser, and when~
she learnt from him what was the will of God, she scrupled not to disregard the~
wishes of her own father, brother-in-law, and even of her son, whom she left~
with calm determination, went forth from her home, and founded the holy~
Institution of the Sisters of the Visitation of St Mary, (at Annecy, upon~
Trinity Sunday 1610.) She most rigidly kept the rules of this Institute, and~
loved so well to be poor, that it made her glad to lack even the necessaries of~
life. She showed herself a model of Christian lowliness, obedience, and all~
graces. Having settled in her heart still to go up higher and higher towards the~
Temple of the Lord, she bound herself by a most difficult vow always to do that~
which she should understand to be best. It was chiefly through her labour that~
the holy Institute of the Visitation became spread far and wide, and she stirred~
up the sisters to godliness and love by her words, by her example, and by~
writings full of Divine wisdom. She duly received the Sacraments before her~
death, and then, at Moulins, on the 13th day of December, in the year 1641,~
departed hence, to be for ever with the Lord. St Vincent of Paul, who was far~
distant, in a vision beheld her soul borne to heaven, and St Francis de Sales~
coming to meet it. Her body was afterwards taken to Annecy. She was famous for~
miracles both before and after her death, and Pope Benedict XIV. enrolled her~
among the Blessed, and Pope Clement XIII. among the Saints. Pope Clement XIV.~
ordered her Feast-day to be kept by the whole Church upon the twenty-first day~
of August.

[Lectio94]
Born of noble parents at Dijon in Burgundy, Jane Frances Frémiot de Chantal lost her mother while she was still a girl, and commended herself to the care of the Virgin Mother of God. Her father gave her in marriage to the Baron de Chantal, and she shewed herself to be a valiant woman above all others, making herself all things to all persons. When her husband was killed while hunting, she made a vow of continence, and she so mastered herself that she did not hesitate to act as godmother to the son of the man who killed her husband. Lest later on she should be moved from her determination to observe chastity, she renewed her vow and inscribed the most holy Name of Jesus on her breast with a hot iron. With St. Francis de Sales as her spiritual director, who taught her the divine will, she laid the foundations of the religious Institute of the Visitation of Holy Mary, which she spread fare and wide. Finally she bound herself by a vow always to do what she understood to be most perfect. Full of merits, she went to the Lord on the 13th day of December, 1641, at Moulins, and was enrolled among the Saints by Clement XIII.
