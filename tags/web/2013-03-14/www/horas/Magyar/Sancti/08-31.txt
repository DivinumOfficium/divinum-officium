[Oratio]
O God, Who didst make thy blessed Confessor Raymond to do a wonderful work in~
delivering thy faithful ones from bondage to the unbelievers, grant unto us at~
his prayers to be delivered from the chains of sin, and with all willingness of~
mind to do those things that are pleasing in thy sight.

This Raymond is commonly called the Unborn, because his was one of the rare~
cases in which the child is not brought into the world in the course of nature,~
but by a surgical operation after the death of the mother. He was the son of~
godly and noble parents, at Portel, (in the dioecese of Urgel,) in Catalonia.~
The tokens of his holy after-life appeared even in his childhood. The things~
that delight children, and the attractions of the world, had no charm for him.~
He was so earnest in godliness that all men marvelled at his habits of premature~
old age. As he grew older, he gave himself to the study of letters, but, at the~
command of his father, turned to farming. He went often to the Chapel of St~
Nicolas, in the suburbs of Portel, to visit the sacred image of the Mother of~
God, which is still sought with great tenderness by the faithful. There he~
poured forth his soul in prayer, and earnestly entreated the Mother of God~
herself to be pleased to take him for her son, to show him the way wherein it~
should be safe for him to walk, and to teach him the science of the Saints.

And the most gracious Maiden was not deaf to his prayers. From her he understood~
that it would please her right well, if he would join the Religious Order which~
had just been founded at her own inspiration, styled of Ransom or of Mercy, for~
buying up and freeing slaves. As soon as he had received this intimation from~
her, he went to Barcelona, and entered the Institute so nobly dedicated to love~
for our neighbour. Once enlisted in the Regular Army, he guarded unspotted for~
ever the virginity which he had already consecrated to the Blessed Virgin for~
ever. But he was a bright and shining light of all other good words and works,~
especially of tender compassion for Christians who were passing a life of~
grievous bondage in the possession of unbelieving masters. To free such he was~
sent into Africa, and delivered many. But his money ran short, and as there were~
still many in imminent danger of denying the faith, he pawned himself. He was~
enkindled with a most vehement longing for the salvation of souls, and by his~
exhortations brought divers Mohammedans to Christ. The Moors therefore threw him~
into close prison, and put him to divers tortures, at last making holes through~
his lips and locking them together with an iron padlock, which horrid cruelty he~
long bore.

The account of these, and other brave things that he did, he got the name of a~
Saint far and wide. Gregory IX. was moved thereby to make Raymond a Cardinal of~
the Holy Roman Church, but in this place of honour the man of God shrank from~
all outward show, and clung ever tightly to the lowliness that beseemeth a~
Religious man. He had started for Rome, (in obedience to the command of the Pope,)~
but had only got as far as Cardona, (six miles from Barcelona,) when he was~
seized with his last illness, and earnestly called for the strengthening~
Sacraments of the Church. But his position became critical, and the Priest had~
not arrived. Then Angels came unto him, clad in the habit of his own Order, and~
ministered unto him the wholesome Provision for the last journey. When he had~
taken It, he gave God thanks, and departed hence to be ever with the Lord. It~
was the last Lord's Day in August, 1240. After his death there was some dispute~
arose as to where his body should be buried so they shut it up in a box, and~
laid it upon a blind mule, and the beast was guided by God to carry it to the~
chapel of St Nicolas, that he might be buried where he had laid the foundations~
of his nobler life. There was built there a Convent of his Order, and the~
faithful come together thither from all parts of Catalonia to honour him, and he~
is famous for divers signs and wonders.

[Lectio94]
Raymund was called Nonnatus, or Unborn, because he was brought into life from the side of his dead mother contrary to the common law of nature. He scorned childish games and the temptations of the world and gave himself to works of devotion so that all admired the boy as having the virtues of a mature man. He loved the Mother of God above all and constantly prayed to her. He entered the religious Order called that of Ransom or of Mercy, for the ransom of captives. He perpetually kept his virginity, which he had already consecrated to the Blessed Virgin, and shone with the other virtues, especially with charity toward the Christians who were living wretched lives under the power of pagans. Gregory IX enrolled him among the Cardinals ; but the man of God shrank from all pomp and always held most firmly to the humility proper to a religious. At Cardona, worn out by his last illness and fortified by the Sacraments of the Church, he went to the Lord on the last Sunday of August in the year 1240.
