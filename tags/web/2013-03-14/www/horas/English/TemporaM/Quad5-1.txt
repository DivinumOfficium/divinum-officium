[Lectio1]
From the holy Gospel according to John
!John 7:32-39
In that time the rulers and Pharisees sent ministers to apprehend him. And so~
on.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo. ) 
!31th Tract on John.
How could they~
take Him until such time as He willed to be taken? If, then, they could not take~
Him until He willed to be taken, were they sent to watch His teaching? Then~
said Jesus unto them Yet a little while am I with you  what ye now seek to do,~
ye shall do; but not yet, for I will not so yet. And why will I not so yet?~
Because yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto Him that sent Me  I~
must fulfill that which I am sent to do, and so go to suffer.

[Responsory1]
R. Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, and out of the hand of~
the unrighteous and cruel man.
* For Thou art my hope.
V. O my God, be not far from me O my God, make haste for my help.
R. For Thou art my hope.

[Lectio2]
You shall seek Me, and shall not find Me, and where I am thither ye cannot come.~
In these words He foretold already His rising again from the dead. While He~
was with them they would not know Him; and afterwards they sought Him, when they~
saw that a multitude already believed in Him. For great signs were wrought also~
when the Lord rose again, and ascended up into heaven. Then were great signs~
again wrought through the Disciples, that is, through them by Him Who worketh~
the same directly also by Himself, according as He had said unto them~
Without Me ye can do nothing. (John xv. 5.) When that lame man that was laid~
daily at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple stood up at the voice of Peter (Acts~
iii.) and walked, and all the people were filled with wonder, Peter bade them~
know that it was not by his own power that he had made him to walk, but by the~
power of Him Whom they had killed. And when they heard this, many were pricked~
in their heart, and said What shall we do? (Acts ii. 37.)

[Responsory2]
R. They that lay wait for my soul take counsel together, saying God hath~
forsaken him;
* Persecute and take him, for there is none to deliver him. O my God, be not far~
from me O my God, make haste for my help.
V. All that hate me whispered together against me; against me did they devise~
my hurt, saying
R. Persecute and take him, for there is none to deliver him. O my God, be not~
far from me O my God, make haste for my help.

[Lectio3]
Nor they saw that they were burdened with the guilt of an exceeding great sin,~
in that they had killed Him, Whom it was their duty to worship and adore and~
for that guilt they knew of no propitiation. Yea, their sin was indeed exceeding~
great; and the consideration of it made them to despair for whom the Lord, when~
He hung upon the Cross, had been willing to pray, as it is written Then said~
Jesus Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. (Luke xxiii. 34.)~
At that hour He had seen among many aliens some that were His Own; for them He~
asked forgiveness, while yet He suffered at their hand, nor considered that they~
were putting Him to death, but only that He was dying for them.

[Responsory3]
R. Mine enemies spoke to me peaceably, but in wrath they troubled me.
* This Thou hast seen, O Lord; keep not silence be not far from me.
V. But as for me, when they troubled me my clothing was sackcloth, and I humbled~
my soul with fasting.
R. This Thou hast seen, O Lord; keep not silence be not far from me.
&Gloria
R. Mine enemies spoke to me peaceably, but in wrath they troubled me. * This Thou hast seen, O Lord; keep not silence be not far from me.

[Ant 2]
In the last day, that great day of the Feast, * Jesus stood and cried, saying:~
If any man thirst, let Him come unto Me, and drink.

[Oratio 2]
Hallow, O Lord, we beseech thee, this our Fast, and mercifully grant us~
forgiveness of all our trespasses.
$Per Dominum

[Ant 3]
If any man thirst, let him come unto Me, * and drink and out of his belly~
shall flow living water, saith the Lord.

[Oratio 3]
Grant unto thy people, we beseech thee, O Lord, health both of mind and body,~
that they, ever cleaving unto good works, may under thy shadow be ever worthily~
defended.
$Per Dominum.

v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 7:32-39
7:32 The Pharisees heard the people murmuring these things concerning him: and the rulers and Pharisees sent ministers to apprehend him.
7:33 Jesus therefore said to them: Yet a little while I am with you: and then I go to him that sent me.
7:34 You shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither you cannot come.
7:35 The Jews therefore said among themselves: Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?
7:36 What is this saying that he hath said: You shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, you cannot come?
7:37 And on the last, and great day of the festivity, Jesus stood and cried, saying: If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.
7:38 He that believeth in me, as the scripture saith, Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.
7:39 Now this he said of the Spirit which they should receive, who believed in him: for as yet the Spirit was not given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.
