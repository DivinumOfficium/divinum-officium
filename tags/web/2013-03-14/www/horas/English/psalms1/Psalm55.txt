55:1 Have mercy on me, O God, for man hath trodden me under foot; * all the day long he hath afflicted me fighting against me.
55:2 My enemies have trodden on me all the day long; * for they are many that make war against me.
55:3 From the height of the day I shall fear: * but I will trust in thee.
55:4 In God I will praise my words, in God I have put my trust: * I will not fear what flesh can do against me.
55:5 All the day long they detested my words: * all their thoughts were against me unto evil.
55:6 They will dwell and hide themselves: * they will watch my heel.
55:7 As they have waited for my soul, for nothing shalt thou save them: * in thy anger thou shalt break the people in pieces.
55:8 O God, I have declared to thee my life: * thou hast set my tears in thy sight,
55:9 As also in thy promise. * Then shall my enemies be turned back.
55:10 In what day soever I shall call upon thee, * behold I know thou art my God.
55:11 In God will I praise the word, in the Lord will I praise his speech. * In God have I hoped, I will not fear what man can do to me.
55:12 In me, O God, are vows to thee, * which I will pay, praises to thee:
55:13 Because thou hast delivered my soul from death, my feet from falling: * that I may please in the sight of God, in the light of the living.
