O Almighty and most merciful God, of thy bountiful goodness keep us, we beseech~
thee, from all things that may hurt us that we, being ready both in body and~
soul, may cheerfully accomplish those things that Thou wouldest have done.

From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 22:1-14
At that time Jesus spake by parables unto the chief priests and Pharisees, and~
said The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage~
for his son. And so on.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great.)
!38th on the Gospels.
I remember that I have often said that, in the Holy Gospel, the Church as she~
now is, is called the kingdom of heaven, for the kingdom of heaven is indeed the~
assembly of the righteous. The Lord hath said by the mouth of His Prophet The~
heaven is My throne. (Isa. lxvi. 1.) Solomon saith The throne of wisdom is the~
soul of the righteous. And Paul saith that Christ is the power of God and the~
wisdom of God. (1 Cor. i. 24.) From these passages we may clearly gather that if~
wisdom be God, and wisdom's throne be the soul of the righteous, and God's~
throne be the heaven, then the soul of the righteous is heaven. Hence also the~
Psalmist saith, speaking of holy preachers The heavens declare the glory of~
God. (xviii. 2.)

[Lectio8]
The kingdom of heaven, therefore, is the Church of the righteous, even of them~
whose hearts seek not for anything upon earth, but who sigh so continually after~
the things which are above, that God doth already reign in them as He doth in~
heaven. Let it then be said, The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king,~
which made a marriage for his son. Ye already understand, my loving friends, 1~
who is that Royal Father of a Royal Son. It is indeed no other than He to Whom~
the Psalmist saith : Give the King thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness~
unto the King's son. (lxxi. 2.) Which made a marriage for his son. God the~
Father made a marriage for God the Son, when He wedded Him to the manhood in the~
womb of the Virgin, when He willed that He Who is God before all ages, should in~
the end of the ages become Man.

[Lectio9]
The marriage union is the union of two persons, but God forbid that we should~
imagine that the One Person of our Redeemer Jesus Christ, Who is both God and~
Man, is formed by a union of an human person with a Divine Person. We profess~
concerning Him that He is of, and in two natures, but we shrink from the ~
blasphemy of saying that He is compounded of two~
persons. It will therefore be clearer and safer to say that the marriage which~
the Father made for His Royal Son was the wedding Him, through the mystery of~
the Incarnation, to His mystic Bride the Holy Church. The womb of the Maiden~
Mother was the marriage chamber in which this union took place. Hence it is that~
the Psalmist saith: In the sun hath He set His tabernacle, Who is as a~
bridegroom coming out of his chamber. (xviii. 6.2)

Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 22:1-14
22:1 AND Jesus answering, spoke again in parables to them, saying:
22:2 The kingdom of heaven is likened to a king, who made a marriage for his son.
22:3 And he sent his servants, to call them that were invited to the marriage; and they would not come.
22:4 Again he sent other servants, saying: Tell them that were invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my beeves and fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come ye to the marriage.
22:5 But they neglected, and went their own ways, one to his farm, and another to his merchandise.
22:6 And the rest laid hands on his servants, and having treated them contumeliously, put them to death.
22:7 But when the king had heard of it, he was angry, and sending his armies, he destroyed those murderers, and burnt their city.
22:8 Then he saith to his servants: The marriage indeed is ready; but they that were invited were not worthy.
22:9 Go ye therefore into the highways; and as many as you shall find, call to the marriage.
22:10 And his servants going forth into the ways, gathered together all that they found, both bad and good: and the marriage was filled with guests.
22:11 And the king went in to see the guests: and he saw there a man who had not on a wedding garment.
22:12 And he saith to him: Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? But he was silent.
22:13 Then the king said to the waiters: Bind his hands and feet, and cast him into the exterior darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
22:14 For many are called, but few are chosen.
