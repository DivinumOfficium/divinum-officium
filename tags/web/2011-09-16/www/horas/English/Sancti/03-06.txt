[Versum 1]
V. Thou hast crowned them with glory and honour, O Lord.
R. And madest them to have dominion over the works of thy hands.

[Ant 1]
For theirs is the Kingdom of heaven * who love not their lives in this world, and~
have attained unto the reward of the Kingdom, and have washed their robes in the~
blood of the Lamb.

[Invit]
For the confession of Blessed Perpetua and Felicitas * let us praise our God.

[Oratio]
Grant us we pray, O Lord our God, to reverence with unceasing devotion the triumph of thy holy martyrs Perpetua and Felicitas; and although we cannot pay the honor what is their due, let us at least present them our humble service

Perpetua et Felicitas, in persecutione Severus imperatoris, in Africa, una cum~
Revocato, Saturnino et Secundulo comprehensae sunt et in tenebricosum carcerem~
detrusae; quibus ultra adjunctus est Satyrus. Erant adhuc catechumenae, sed~
paulo post baptizatae sunt. Paucis diebus interjectis, e carcere ad forum~
deductae cum sociis, post gloriosam confessionem, ab Hilarione procuratore~
damnantur ad bestias. Inde hilares descendunt ad carcerem, ubi variis visionibus~
recreantur et ad martyrii palmam accenduntur. Perpetuam.nec patris senio~
confecti iteratae preces et lacrimae, neo erga filium infantem pendentem ad~
ubera maternus amor, nec supplicii atrocitas, a Christi fide dimovere umquam~
potuerunt

[Lectio5]
Felicitas vero instante spectaculo die, cum octo jam menses praegnans esset, in~
magno erat luctu, ne differretur; leges quippe vetabant praegnantes supplicio~
affici. At precibus commartyrum accelerato partu, enixa est filiam. Cumque in~
partu laborans doleret, ait illi quidam de custodibus: Quae sic modo doles, quid~
facies objecta bestiis? Cui illa: Modo ego patior; illic autem alius erit in me,~
qui patietur pro me, quia et ego pro illo passura sum.

[Lectio6]
In amphitheatrum, toto inspectante populo, producuntur tandem generossae~
mulieres, Nonis Martii, ac primum flagellis caeduntur. Tunc a ferocissima vacca~
aliquamdiu jactatae, plagis concisae et in terram elisae sunt. Demum cum sociis.~
qui a variis bestiis vexati fuerant, gladiorum ictibus conficiuntur. Harum~
sanctarum Martyrum festum Pius decimus Pontifex maximus ad ritum duplicem pro~
universa Ecclesia evexit ac diei sextae Martii adsignari mandavit.

[Lectio94]
Perpetua and Felicitas were arrested in Africa, together with Saturninus and Secundus, during the persecution of the emperor Severus, and were cast into a dark dungeon, where they were later joined by Saturus. There as they were still catechumens, they were baptized. Then they were condemned to the beasts. Felicitas was undergoing the pains of childbirth, and as she groaned, one of the gaolers asked her what she would do in the ampitheatre. She answered, Now it is I who suffer, but there it will be another within me who will suffer on my account, because I shall be suffering for him. They were brought into the ampitheatre, with all the people looking on, and were beaten with rods. Then they were tossed by a savage cow for some time, gored with its horns and dashed to the ground. Finally they were killed by the sword together with their companions who had been attacked by various wild beasts, on the sixth of March
