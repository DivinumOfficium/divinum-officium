[Lectio93]
In the reign of the Emperor Decius one Tryphon strove by preaching the faith of~
Jesus Christ to bring all men to worship Him. For this cause he was taken by the~
servants of Decius. He was first tormented upon the rack, and flesh stripped~
from him with iron claws; then red-hot nails were driven into his insteps, he~
was beaten with cudgels and scarified with lighted torches. The sight of the~
courage wherewith he bore all, brought the Praefect Respicius to believe in the~
Lord Christ, and he forthwith declared himself a Christian. He also was divers~
ways tormented, and then led along with Tryphon before the statue of Jupiter.~
When Tryphon prayed, the statue fell down. Then were both Tryphon and Respicius~
savagely lashed with whips loaded with lead, until they grasped the crown of a~
most glorious testimony, upon the 10th day of November. Upon the same day a~
certain maiden named Nympha, having openly confessed that Jesus Christ is very~
God, added the palm of martyrdom to the crown of virginity.
