From the first letter of blessed Apostle John
!1 John 3:1-6
1 Behold what manner of charity the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should~
be called, and should be the sons of God. Therefore the world knoweth not us,~
because it knew not him.
2 Dearly beloved, we are now the sons of God; and it hath not yet appeared what~
we shall be. We know, that, when he shall appear, we shall be like to him:~
because we shall see him as he is.
3 And every one that hath this hope in him, sanctifieth himself, as he also is~
holy.
4 Whosoever committeth sin committeth also iniquity; and sin is iniquity.
5 And you know that he appeared to take away our sins, and in him there is no~
sin.
6 Whosoever abideth in him, sinneth not; and whosoever sinneth, hath not seen~
him, nor known him.

!John 3:7-12.
7 Little children, let no man deceive you. He that doth justice is just, even as~
he is just.
8 He that committeth sin is of the devil: for the devil sinneth from the~
beginning. For this purpose, the Son of God appeared, that he might destroy the~
works of the devil.
9 Whosoever is born of God, committeth not sin: for his seed abideth in him, and~
he can not sin, because he is born of God.
10 In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil.~
Whosoever is not just, is not of God, nor he that loveth not his brother.
11 For this is the declaration, which you have heard from the beginning, that~
you should love one another.
12 Not as Cain, who was of the wicked one, and killed his brother. And wherefore~
did he kill him? Because his own works were wicked: and his brother's just

!1 John 3:13-16
13 Wonder not, brethren, if the world hate you.
14 We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren.~
He that loveth not, abideth in death.
15 Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer. And you know that no murderer~
hath eternal life abiding in himself.
16 In this we have known the charity of God, because he hath laid down his life~
for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.

From the Sermons of St John Chrysostom, Patriarch of Constantinople.
!On the Ascension, tom 3.
Then Christ went up into heaven, He offered unto the Father the First-fruits of~
our nature, and the Father marvelled at the offering, seeing the Majesty of the~
Priest and the Spotlessness of the oblation. He received the Sacrifice into His~
Own hands, He made It to sit upon His Throne, nay, more, He gave It a place at~
His Own Right Hand. Let us ask what nature was His Who heard the words: "Sit~
Thou at My right hand," (Ps. cix. 1,) ” what nature was His to Whom God said "~
Be Thou Partaker of My Throne?" It was the same nature as was his who heard the~
sentence " Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return." (Gen. iii. 19.)~
Archangels beheld our nature upon the Throne of the Lord, refulgent with eternal~
glory.

[Lectio5]
It was not enough of glory for Him * to be exalted above the heavens, nor to be~
ranked with angels but He was exalted above the heavens, He went up above the~
Cherubim, He ascended beyond the Seraphim, neither found He His rank beneath the~
Throne of the Lord of lords. Behold how high the heaven is above the earth, and~
the earth above hell, how high above the heaven is the heaven of heavens, how~
high above the heaven of heavens the Angels, above the Angels the Higher Powers,~
and above the Higher Powers the Throne of the Lord. Above all these hath One of~
our nature been exalted, so that man, which had fallen so low that there was no~
farther fall for him, is now in place so high, that there is thence no~
ascending.

[Lectio6]
Paul also, dwelling on this, saith " He That descended is the Same also That~
ascended up far above all heavens," even as he had said " Now, that He~
ascended, what is it but that He also descended first into the lower parts of~
the earth." (Eph. iv. 9, 10.) Learn hence Who it was That ascended, and with~
what nature He was exalted. And with this thought I wish to bring my sermon to~
an end. From the thought of that glorified Manhood let us learn with amazement~
what the goodness of God is that goodness which hath crowned with an honour,~
higher than which is none, and a glory, greater than which is none, a Person~
Sharer of our nature, even That Person Which this day hath taken the place which~
is His of right, above all things other than Himself. This day Angels and

From the Holy Gospel according to Mark
!Mark 16:14-20
At that time Jesus appeared unto the eleven disciples as they sat at meat, and~
upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed~
not them which had seen Him after He was risen. And so on.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory the Great.
!Same as before.
"So then, after the Lord Jesus had spoken unto them, He was received up into~
heaven, and sat on the right hand of God" We learn in the Old Testament, (4~
Kings ii.,) that Elijah was taken up into heaven. But this word "heaven" may~
mean either the terrestrial atmosphere, or the space external to the sphere of~
this planet. Of these the atmosphere closely surrounds the earth, and we call~
the birds "the fowls of the heaven," because we see them fly therein. It was~
only up into this that Elijah was taken, that he might be carried off suddenly~
into some part of the earth, to us unknown, and there live in profound peace of~
body and soul, until the end of the world, when he will return and pay the debt~
of nature. For him, therefore, death waiteth, but is not escaped. But our~
Redeemer made it not to wait for Him, but conquered it, and by rising again~
shattered it, and by His Ascension showed forth the glory of His Againrising.

[Lectio8]
We must mark also, how that Elijah was taken up in a chariot, as though to show~
plainly that for a mere man some outward help was needful. This help was given~
to him by Angels, as plainly appeareth, since it was impossible for one whom a~
weak nature yet weighed down earthward, to fly up even into the atmosphere. But~
of our Redeemer we read not that He was borne up in a chariot, or by Angels,~
since He by Whom all things were made, clearly rose above all things by His Own~
Power. He returned unto Him with Whom He was, and whither He returned, there He~
abode, for albeit as touching His Manhood He ascended up into heaven, yet, as~
touching His Godhead, He still comprehended both heaven and earth.

[Lectio9]
But as the sale of Joseph by his brethren was a type of the sale of Christ, so~
were the translations of Enoch and Elijah types of His Ascension. The Lord~
therefore had had forerunners and witnesses of His Ascension, the one before the~
Law, the other under the Law, that Himself might one day come, Who was able~
indeed to pass into the heavens. Hence also there is some difference to be~
observed in the manner wherein each was translated. Enoch was seen no more,~
~(Gen. v. 24,) for God took him Elijah was carried up by a whirlwind into~
heaven He That came after them was not taken up, nor carried up, but went up~
through space by His Own Power.

v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Mark
!Mark 16:14-20
16:14 At length he appeared to the eleven as they were at table: and he upbraided them with their incredulity and hardness of heart, because they did not believe them who had seen him after he was risen again.
16:15 And he said to them: Go ye into the whole world, and preach the gospel to every creature.
16:16 He that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved: but he that believeth not shall be condemned.
16:17 And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name they shall cast out devils: they shall speak with new tongues.
16:18 They shall take up serpents; and if they shall drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them: they shall lay their hands upon the sick, and they shall recover.
16:19 And the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God.
16:20 But they going forth preached every where: the Lord working withal, and confirming the word with signs that followed.
