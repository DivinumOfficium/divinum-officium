Lesson from the book of Isaias
!Isa 42:1-4
1 BEHOLD my servant, I will uphold him: my elect, my soul delighteth in him: I~
have given my spirit upon him, he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.
2 He shall not cry, nor have respect to person, neither shall his voice be heard~
abroad.
3 The bruised reed he shall not break, and smoking flax he shall not quench: he~
shall bring forth judgment unto truth.
4 He shall not be sad, nor troublesome, till he set judgment in the earth: and~
the islands shall wait for his law.

!Isa 42:5-7
5 Thus saith the Lord God that created the heavens, and stretched them out: that~
established the earth, and the things that spring out of it: that giveth breath~
to the people upon it, and spirit to them that tread thereon.
6 I the Lord have called thee in justice, and taken thee by the hand, and~
preserved thee. And I have given thee for a covenant of the people, for a light~
of the Gentiles:
7 That thou mightest open the eyes of the blind, and bring forth the prisoner~
out of prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.

!Isa 42:10-13
10 Sing ye to the Lord a new song, his praise is from the ends of the earth: you~
that go down to the sea, and all that are therein: ye islands, and ye~
inhabitants of them.
11 Let the desert and the cities thereof be exalted: Cedar shall dwell in~
houses: ye inhabitants of Petra, give praise, they shall cry from the top of the~
mountains.
12 They shall give glory to the Lord, and shall declare his praise in the~
islands.
13 The Lord shall go forth as a mighty man, as a man of war shall he stir up~
zeal: he shall shout and cry: he shall prevail against his enemies.
