90:1 He that dwelleth in the aid of the most High, * shall abide under the protection of the God of Jacob.
90:2 He shall say to the Lord: Thou art my protector, and my refuge: * my God, in him will I trust.
90:3 For he hath delivered me from the snare of the hunters: * and from the sharp word.
90:4 He will overshadow thee with his shoulders: * and under his wings thou shalt trust.
90:5 His truth shall compass thee with a shield: * thou shalt not be afraid of the terror of the night.
90:6 Of the arrow that flieth in the day, of the business that walketh about in the dark: * of invasion, or of the noonday devil.
90:7 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand: * but it shall not come nigh thee.
90:8 But thou shalt consider with thy eyes: * and shalt see the reward of the wicked.
90:9 Because thou, O Lord, art my hope: * thou hast made the most High thy refuge.
90:10 There shall no evil come to thee: * nor shall the scourge come near thy dwelling.
90:11 For he hath given his angels charge over thee; * to keep thee in all thy ways.
90:12 In their hands they shall bear thee up: * lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.
90:13 Thou shalt walk upon the asp and the basilisk: * and thou shalt trample under foot the lion and the dragon.
90:14 Because he hoped in me I will deliver him: * I will protect him because he hath known my name.
90:15 He shall cry to me, and I will hear him: * I am with him in tribulation, I will deliver him, and I will glorify him.
90:16 I will fill him with length of days; * and I will shew him my salvation.
