Lesson from the second letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians
!2 Cor. 10:17-18; 11:1-2
Brethren: He who boasts, let him boast in the Lord. For he is not approved who commends himself, but he whom the Lord commends. Would to God that you could bear with a little of my foolishness! Nay, do bear with me! For I am jealous for you with a divine jealousy. For I betrothed you to one spouse, that I might present you a chaste virgin to Christ.

[Graduale]
!Ps 44:5
In your splendor and your beauty ride on triumphant, and reign.

V. Behind her the virgins of her train are brought to the King. They are borne in to You with gladness. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 25:1-13
At that time, Jesus spoke this parable to His disciples: Then will the kingdom~
of heaven be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went forth to meet the~
bridegroom and the bride. Five of them were foolish and five wise. But the five~
foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them, while the wise did~
take oil in their vessels with the lamps. Then as the bridegroom was long in~
coming, they all became drowsy and slept. And at midnight a cry arose, ‘Behold,~
the bridegroom is coming, go forth to meet him!’ Then all those virgins arose~
and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your~
oil, for our lamps are going out.’ The wise answered, saying, ‘Lest there may~
not be enough for us and for you, go rather to those who sell it, and buy some~
for yourselves.’ Now while they were gone to buy it, the bridegroom came; and~
those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was~
shut. Finally there came also the other virgins, who said, ‘Sir, sir, open the~
door for us!’ But he answered and said, ‘Amen I say to you, I do not know you.’~
Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 44:10
The daughters of kings come to meet You; the queen takes her place at Your right~
hand in gilded clothing, surrounded with variety.

[Secreta]
May the offering made by Your devoted people be pleasing to You, O Lord, in~
honor of Your Saints, through whose merits they know they have received help in~
times of trial.
