Lesson from the first letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians
!1 Cor. 1:4-8
Brethren: I give thanks to my God always concerning you for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus, because in everything you have been enriched in Him, in all utterance and in all knowledge; even as the witness to the Christ has been made so firm in you that you lack no grace, while awaiting the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who will also keep you secure unto the end, unimpeachable in the day of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 9:1-8
At that time, Jesus, getting into a boat, crossed over and came to his own town.~
And behold, they brought to Him a paralytic lying on a pallet. And Jesus, seeing~
their faith, said to the paralytic, Take courage, son; your sins are forgiven~
you. And behold, some of the scribes said within themselves, This man~
blasphemes. And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, Why do you harbor evil~
thoughts in your hearts? For which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven~
you,’ or to say, ‘Arise, and walk’? But that you may know that the Son of Man~
has power on earth to forgive sins, - then He said to the paralytic - Arise,~
take up your pallet and go to your house. And he arose, and went away to his~
house. But when the crowds saw it, they were struck with fear, and glorified God~
Who had given such power to men.

[Offertorium]
!Ex 24:4-5
Moses consecrated an altar to the Lord, offering upon it holocausts, and~
sacrificing victims: he made an evening sacrifice to the Lord God for an odor of~
sweetness, in the sight of the Israelites.

[Secreta]
O God, Who, through the gifts we have exchanged with You in this sacrament, have~
made us partakers of the supreme Godhead, grant, we beseech You, that, as we~
have knowledge of Your truth, so we may fully live up to it.

make us receive it worthily.
