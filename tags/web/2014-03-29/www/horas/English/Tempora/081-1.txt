Lesson from the book of Proverbs
!Prov 3:1-6
1 My son, forget not my law, and let thy heart keep my commandments.
2 For they shall add to thee length of days, and years of life and peace.
3 Let not mercy and truth leave thee, put them about thy neck, and write them in the tables of thy heart:
4 And thou shalt find grace and good understanding before God and men.
5 Have confidence in the Lord with all thy heart, and lean not upon thy own prudence.
6 In all thy ways think on him, and he will direct thy steps.

[Responsory1]
R. O Lord, Father and Governor of my life, leave me not, lest I fall before mine adversaries,
* and mine enemy rejoice over me.
V. Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.
R. Lest mine enemy rejoice over me.

7 Be not wise in thy own conceit: fear God, and depart from evil:
8 For it shall be health to thy navel, and moistening to thy bones.

10 And thy barns shall be filled with abundance, and thy presses shall run over with wine.

* Thou didst make thy people mighty and honourable.

!Prov 3:11-15
11 My son, reject not the correction of the Lord: and do not faint when thou art chastised by him:
12 For whom the Lord loveth, he chastiseth: and as a father in the son he pleaseth himself.
13 Blessed is the man that findeth wisdom and is rich in prudence:
14 The purchasing thereof is better than the merchandise of silver, and her fruit than the chiefest and purest gold:
15 She is more precious than all riches: and all the things that are desired, are not to be compared with her.

[Responsory3]
R. Lord, thine eyes behold all that is in the heart of man, and in thy book are they all written.
* Man looketh on the outward appearance, but God looketh on the heart.
V. For He searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts.
R. Man looketh on the outward appearance, but God looketh on the heart.
&Gloria
R. Man looketh on the outward appearance, but God looketh on the heart.
