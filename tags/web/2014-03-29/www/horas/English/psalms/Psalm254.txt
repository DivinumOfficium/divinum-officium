(Canticum Sapientiae * Sap 3:7-9)
3:7 The just shall shine, and shall run to and fro like sparks among the reeds.
3:8 They shall judge nations, and rule over people, and their Lord shall reign for ever.
3:9 They that trust in him, shall understand the truth: and they that are faithful in love shall rest in him: for grace and peace is to his elect.
