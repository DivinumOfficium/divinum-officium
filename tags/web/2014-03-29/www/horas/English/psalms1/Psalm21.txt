21:1 O God my God, look upon me: why hast thou forsaken me? * Far from my salvation are the words of my sins.
21:2 O my God, I shall cry by day, and thou wilt not hear: * and by night, and it shall not be reputed as folly in me.
21:3 But thou dwellest in the holy place, * the praise of Israel. 
21:4 In thee have our fathers hoped: * they have hoped, and thou hast delivered them.
21:5 They cried to thee, and they were saved: * they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.
21:6 But I am a worm, and no man: * the reproach of men, and the outcast of the people.
21:7 All they that saw me have laughed me to scorn: * they have spoken with the lips, and wagged the head.
21:8 He hoped in the Lord, let him deliver him: * let him save him, seeing he delighteth in him.
21:9 For thou art he that hast drawn me out of the womb: * my hope from the breasts of my mother. I was cast upon thee from the womb.
21:10 From my mother’s womb thou art my God, * depart not from me.
21:11 For tribulation is very near: * for there is none to help me.
21:13 Many calves have surrounded me: * fat bulls have besieged me.
21:14 They have opened their mouths against me, * as a lion ravening and roaring.
21:15 I am poured out like water; * and all my bones are scattered.
21:16 My heart is become like wax melting * in the midst of my bowels.
21:17 My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue hath cleaved to my jaws: * and thou hast brought me down into the dust of death.
21:18 For many dogs have encompassed me: * the council of the malignant hath besieged me.
21:19 They have dug my hands and feet. * They have numbered all my bones.
21:20 And they have looked and stared upon me. * They parted my garments amongst them; and upon my vesture they cast lots.
21:21 But thou, O Lord, remove not thy help to a distance from me; * look towards my defence.
21:22 Deliver, O God, my soul from the sword: * my only one from the hand of the dog.
21:23 Save me from the lion’s mouth; * and my lowness from the horns of the unicorns.
21:23 I will declare thy name to my brethren: * in the midst of the church will I praise thee.
21:24 Ye that fear the Lord, praise him: * all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him.
21:25 Let all the seed of Israel fear him: * because he hath not slighted nor despised the supplication of the poor man.
21:26 Neither hath he turned away his face from me: * and when I cried to him he heard me.
21:27 With thee is my praise in a great church: * I will pay my vows in the sight of them that fear him.
21:28 The poor shall eat and shall be filled: and they shall praise the Lord that seek him: * their hearts shall live for ever and ever.
21:29 All the ends of the earth * shall remember, and shall be converted to the Lord:
21:30 And all the kindreds of the Gentiles * shall adore in his sight.
21:31 For the kingdom is the Lord’s; * and he shall have dominion over the nations.
21:32 All the fat ones of the earth have eaten and have adored: * all they that go down to the earth shall fall before him.
21:32 And to him my soul shall live: * and my seed shall serve him.
21:32 There shall be declared to the Lord a generation to come: * and the heavens shall shew forth his justice to a people that shall be born, which the Lord hath made.
