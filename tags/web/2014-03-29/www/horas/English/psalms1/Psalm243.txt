(Canticum Isaiae * Isa 63:1-5)
63:1 Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bosra, this beautiful one in his robe, walking in the greatness of his strength. I, that speak justice, and am a defender to save.
63:2 Why then is thy apparel red, and thy garments like theirs that tread in the winepress?
63:3 I have trodden the winepress alone, and of the Gentiles there is not a man with me: I have trampled on them in my indignation, and have trodden them down in my wrath, and their blood is sprinkled upon my garments, and I have stained all my apparel.
63:4 For the day of vengeance is in my heart, the year of my redemption is come.
63:5 I looked about, and there was none to help: I sought, and there was none to give aid: and my own arm hath saved for me, and my indignation itself hath helped me.
