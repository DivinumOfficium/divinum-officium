81:1 God hath stood in the congregation of gods: * and being in the midst of them he judgeth gods.
81:2 How long will you judge unjustly: * and accept the persons of the wicked?
81:3 Judge for the needy and fatherless: * do justice to the humble and the poor.
81:4 Rescue the poor; * and deliver the needy out of the hand of the sinner.
81:5 They have not known nor understood: they walk on in darkness: * all the foundations of the earth shall be moved.
81:6 I have said: You are gods * and all of you the sons of the most High.
81:7 But you like men shall die: * and shall fall like one of the princes.
81:8 Arise, O God, judge thou the earth: * for thou shalt inherit among all the nations.
