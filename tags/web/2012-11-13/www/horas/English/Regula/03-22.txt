03-22# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 43: Concerning Those Who Come Late to the Work of God Or to Table
_
At the hour of divine office, as soon as the signal has been heard, let the monk leave whatever he may have in hand and make great haste, but with due gravity, that levity find no occasion; for let nothing be preferred before the Work of God. But if anyone shall have come in to night office after the Gloria of the ninety-fourth psalm, which for this very reason we particularly wish shall be said in a drawn out and scrupulously careful manner, let him not take his proper place in choir, but last of all, or in a place set apart by the abbot for such as are thus guilty of negligence, that he may be visible to him and to all present until, the Work of God being finished, he has made satisfaction by this public penance.

And we have adjudged that they ought thus to be placed either in the last place in choir or else in a place apart by themselves, so as to be seen by all and that they may amend for very shame’s sake; for if they remain outside the oratory one of them perchance might be such as would return to his place in the dormitory and go to sleep, or at least sit himself down outside the door and while away the time with conversation, so that occasion would be given to the enemy; let him then enter so that he may not lose the whole of the office; and for the future let him amend. But at the day hours let him who shall have come to the Work of God after the versicle and Gloria of the first psalm said after the versicle stand last and not presume to take his place among those chanting in choir until he has made satisfaction according to the rule we have stated above, unless by chance the abbot shall have personally given him leave; but on the understanding that he do penance afterwards.
