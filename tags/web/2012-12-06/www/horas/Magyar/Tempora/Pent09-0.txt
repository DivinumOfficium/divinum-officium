When the Lord would take up * Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, Elisha cried,~
and said: My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.

[Versum 1]
V. Let the evening prayer ascend unto thee, O Lord.
R. And let there descend upon us thy mercy.

[Oratio]
Let thy merciful ears, O Lord, be open to the prayers of thy humble servants;~
and, that they may obtain their petitions, make them to ask such things as shall~
please thee.

Olvasmány a Királyok második könyvébõl
!2 Kgs 1:1-4
1 Acháb halála után Moáb elszakadt Izraeltõl. 
2 Achaszja pedig Szamariában a rácson át leesett a tetõrõl, és betegen feküdt. Ezért követeket küldött ezzel a megbízatással: "Menjetek, kérdezzétek meg Baal-Zebubot, Ekron istenét, vajon felépülök-e bajomból?" 
3 Az Úr angyala azonban így szólt a tisbei Illéshez: "Indulj, menj eléje Szamaria királya követeinek és kérdezd meg tõlük: Hát nincs Isten Izraelben, hogy Baal-Zebubot, Ekron istenét mentek megkérdezni? 
4 Ezért ezt mondja az Úr: Többé nem kelsz föl fekvõhelyedrõl, amelyre lefeküdtél, meg kell halnod." 

[Responsory1]
R. Prepare your hearts unto the Lord, and serve Him Only
* And He will deliver you out of the hand of your enemies.
V. Return unto Him with all your hearts, and put away the strange gods from~
among you.
R. And He will deliver you out of the hand of your enemies

[Lectio2]
!2 Kgs 1:4-6
4 Ezzel Illés továbbment. 
5 Amikor a követek visszatértek, (Achaszja) megkérdezte: "Miért jöttetek vissza?" 
6 Ezt válaszolták: "Szembejött velünk egy ember és ezt mondta: Menjetek vissza a királyhoz, aki küldött benneteket, és jelentsétek neki: ezt mondja az Úr: Hát nincs Isten Izraelben, hogy Baal-Zebubot, Ekron istenét küldesz megkérdezni? Ezért nem kelsz föl többé fekvõhelyedrõl, amelyre lefeküdtél, meg kell halnod." 

[Responsory2]
R. God, Which heareth all, even He sent His Angel, and took me from keeping my~
father's sheep, and
* Anointed me with the oil of His mercy.
V. The Lord That delivered me out of the mouth of the lion, and out of the paw~
of the bear
R. And anointed me with the oil of His mercy.

[Lectio3]
!2 Kgs 1:7-10
7 Megkérdezte tõlük: "Milyen volt az az ember, aki szembejött veletek és ezeket a szavakat intézte hozzátok?" 
8 "Szõrruha volt rajta, a derekán pedig bõröv" - felelték. Erre megjegyezte: "Illés volt, a tisbei." 
9 Azután elküldött hozzá egy ötven (férfi) fölé rendelt embert az ötvennel együtt. Az éppen akkor ért oda, amikor egy hegy csúcsán ült, s így szólította meg: "Isten embere, a király parancsolja, gyere le!" 
10 Illés azt felelte az ötven (férfi) fölé rendelt embernek: "Jól van, ha Isten embere vagyok, szálljon alá tûz az égbõl és pusztítson el ötven (embereddel) együtt." Erre tûz csapott le az égbõl és elpusztította az ötvennel együtt. 

[Responsory3]
R. The Lord That delivered me out of the mouth of the lion, and out of the paw~
of the bear
* He will deliver me out of the hand of mine enemies.
V. God hath sent forth His mercy and His truth, and delivered my soul from among~
the lion's whelps.
R. He will deliver me out of the hand of mine enemies.
&Gloria
R. He will deliver me out of the hand of mine enemies.

From the sermons of St Austin, Bishop of Hippo
!201st for the Season.
Dearly beloved brethren, in the Lessons which are now being read to us day by~
day, I have often warned you that we must not follow the deathful letter, to the~
abandonment of the quickening spirit. For it is thus that the Apostle saith:~
"The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life." (2 Cor. iii. 6.) If we will~
understand only the plain meaning of the letter, we shall get little or no~
edification from our readings in the Divine Scriptures. All those things whereof~
we hear were types and images of things

[Responsory4]
R. Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.
* Because the hand of the Lord was with him, he smote the Philistine, and took~
away the reproach from Israel.
V. Is not this David? Did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying~
Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
R. Because the hand of the Lord was with him, he smote the Philistine, and took~
away the reproach from Israel.

[Lectio5]
The Blessed Elias was a type of the Lord our Saviour. Just as Elias was rejected~
by the Jews, so was the true Elias, even our Lord, rejected and despised by the~
same Jews. Elias went away out of his own country, and Christ hath left the~
synagogue Elias went into the desert, and Christ hath come into the world. Elias,~
when he was in the desert, was fed by ravens, and Christ in the desert of this~
world is comforted by the faith of the Gentiles.

[Responsory5]
R. Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain upon~
you
* For there are the mighty of Israel fallen
V. All ye mountains that stand round about, the Lord look upon you but let Him~
pass by Gilboa
R. For there are the mighty of Israel fallen

[Lectio6]
For the ravens which, at the command of the Lord, ministered unto Elias, were a~
type of the flock of Gentiles. Wherefore also it is said for the Gentile Church:~
"I am black, but comely O daughters of Jerusalem!" (Cant. i. 4.) Why is the~
Church black but comely She is black by nature, but comely by grace. Why is~
she black by nature? Because she must needs own: "Behold, I was shapen in~
iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me." (Ps. 1. 7.) Why is she comely~
by? Sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be clean wash me, and I shall be~
whiter than snow,

[Responsory6]
R. Thus saith the Lord I took thee out of thy father's house, and appointed~
thee to be ruler over My people, over Israel.
* And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, to establish thy kingdom for~
ever.
V. And I have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that~
are in the earth and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies.
R. And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, to establish thy kingdom for~
ever.
&Gloria
R. And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, to establish thy kingdom for~
ever.

!Luke 19:41-17
At that time When Jesus was come near to Jerusalem, He beheld the city, and~
wept over it, saying If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day,~
the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.~
And so on.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory the Great.
!39 on the Gospels.
No man that hath read the history of the destruction of Jerusalem by the Roman~
Princes Vespasian and Titus, can be ignorant that it was of that destruction~
that the Lord spoke when He wept over the ruin of the city. It is these Princes~
that are pointed at where it is said " For the days shall come upon thee that~
thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee." The truth of what folio weth "~
They shall not leave in thee one stone upon another "  is even now fulfilled~
in the change of site of the city, which hath been re-built round about that~
place without the gates, where the Lord was crucified, while the ancient city~
hath been, as I am told, rooted up from the very foundations

[Responsory7]
@Tempora/Pent01-3:Responsory1

[Lectio8]
What the sin of Jerusalem was which brought upon her the punishment of this~
destruction, we find written after " Because thou knewest not the time of thy~
visitation." The Maker of men, through the mystery of His Incarnation, was~
pleased to visit her, but she remembered not to fear and to love Him. Hence also~
the Prophet Jeremiah, rebuking the hardness of man's heart, calleth the birds of~
the air to testify against it, saying "The stork in the heaven knoweth her~
appointed time and the turtle, and the swallow, and the crane, observe the~
time of their coming but my people know not the judgment of the Lord." (viii.~
7.)

[Responsory8]
@Tempora/Pent01-0:Responsory8

[Lectio9]
The Saviour wept over the ruin of the unfaithful city, while she herself as yet~
knew not that it was coming. If thou hadst known, said He, even thou and we may~
understand Him to have meant thou wouldest thyself have wept, in place of making~
merry as thou now dost, knowing not what hangeth over thee. And hence He saith~
farther: "at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace."~
While she was giving herself up to fleshly pleasures, and casting no look ahead~
upon coming sorrows, she had still for a day in her power the things which might~
have brought unto her peace.
&teDeum

[Ant 2]
When the Lord was come near to Jerusalem, He beheld the city, and wept * over it,~
saying If thou hadst known, even thou! For the days shall come upon thee, that~
thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep~
thee in on every side and shall lay thee even with the ground because thou~
knewest not the time of thy visitation. Alleluia.

[Versum 2]
V. The Lord reigneth He is clothed with majesty.
R. The Lord is clothed with strength, and hath girded Himself with power.

[Ant 3]
It is written My house is the house of prayer * for all nations but ye have~
made it a den of thieves. And He taught daily in the Temple.

[Versum 3]
V. Let my prayer, O Lord, be set forth.
R. As incense before thee.
