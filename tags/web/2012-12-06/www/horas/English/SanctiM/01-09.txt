[Lectio1]
From the letter of blessed Apostle Paul to the Romans
!Rom 13:1-4
1 LET every soul be subject to higher powers: for there is no power but from~
God: and those that are, are ordained of God.
2 Therefore he that resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God. And~
they that resist, purchase to themselves damnation.
3 For princes are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. Wilt thou then~
not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good: and thou shalt have praise~
from the same.
4 For he is God's minister to thee, for good. But if thou do that which is evil,~
fear: for he beareth not the sword in vain.

!Rom 13:4-7
4 For he is God's minister: an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.
5 Wherefore be subject of necessity, not only for wrath, but also for~
conscience' sake.
6 For therefore also you pay tribute. For they are the ministers of God, serving~
unto this purpose.
7 Render therefore to all men their dues. Tribute, to whom tribute is due:~
custom, to whom custom: fear, to whom fear: honour, to whom honour.

[Lectio3]
!Rom 12:8-10
8 He that exhorteth, in exhorting; he that giveth, with simplicity; he that~
ruleth, with carefulness; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.
9 Let love be without dissimulation. Hating that which is evil, cleaving to that~
which is good.
10 Loving one another with the charity of brotherhood, with honour preventing~
one another.
