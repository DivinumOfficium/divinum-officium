Evangélium szent Lukács Evangélista kõnyvébõl
!Luke 1:39-47
Azon idõben Mária útnak indult, és a hegyekbe sietett, Júda városába. Zakariás~
házába tért be és üdvözölte Erzsébetet. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan,)
!Commentary on Luke, Bk. ii. c
When any one asketh another for credence, he is bound to give some reasonable~
ground. And so the Angel, when he announced to Mary the counsel of God, gave,~
as a proof, the conception of Elizabeth, then aged and barren, that Mary might~
perceive, by this example, that with God nothing is impossible. When the holy~
Virgin had heard it, she arose and went to visit her cousin. She did not go to~
see if what she had heard was true, because she did not believe God, or because~
she knew not who the messenger had been, or yet because she doubted the fact~
adduced in proof. She went joyfully as one who hath received a mercy in answer~
to his vow goeth to pay the same. She went with devotion, as a godly person~
goeth to execute a religious duty. She went into the hill country in joyful~
haste. And is it not something that she went up into the hills? God was already~
in her womb, and her feeling bore her continually upward. The grace of the Holy~
Spirit knoweth no slow working.

[Responsory1]
R. Send forth the Lamb, O Lord, the Ruler of the land
* From the rock in the wilderness unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.
V. Show us thy mercy, O Lord, and grant us thy salvation.
R. From the rock in the wilderness unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.

[Lectio2]
Godly women will learn from the example of the Mother of God to take a tender~
care of their kinswomen who are with child. In pursuance of this charity, Mary,~
who had hitherto remained alone at home, was not deterred by her maidenly~
shyness from entering on a public journey; she faced for this end the hardships~
of mountain travelling; and encountered with a sense of duty the weary length of~
the way. The Virgin left her home, and went into the hill country with haste,~
unmindful of the trouble, and remembering only the office to which her cousinly~
love prompted her, in spite of the delicacy of her sex. Maidens will learn from~
her not to idle about from house to house, to loiter in the streets, nor to take~
part in conversations in public. Mary, as she was hasteful to pass through the~
public roads, so was she slow again to enter on them she abode with her cousin~
about three months.

[Responsory2]
R. Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down the Righteous~
One.
* Let the earth open, and let her bring forth the Saviour.
V. Send forth the Lamb, O Lord, the Ruler of the land, from the rock in the~
wilderness unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.
R. Let the earth open, and let her bring forth the Saviour.

[Lectio3]
As the modesty of Mary is a pattern for the imitation of all maidens, so also is~
her humility. She went to see Elizabeth, like one cousin going to visit another,~
and as the younger to the elder. Not only did she first go, but she first~
saluted Elizabeth. Now, the purer a virgin is, the humbler ought she to be. She~
will know how to submit herself to her elders. She that professeth chastity~
ought to be a very mistress of humility. Lowly-mindedness is at once the very~
ground in which devotion groweth, and the first and principal rule of its~
teaching. In this act of the Virgin then we see the greater going to visit and~
to succour the lesser Mary to Elizabeth, Christ to John.

[Responsory3]
R. The waste places have brought forth sweet-smelling buds for Israel; for,~
behold, our God will come with power.
* And His brightness is with Him.
V. Out of Zion the perfection of beauty, our God shall come manifestly.
R. And His brightness is with Him.
&Gloria
R. And His brightness is with Him.

[Ant 2]
As soon as the voice of thy salutation * sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped~
in my womb for joy. Alleluia.

[Oratio]
Stir up, O Lord, we pray thee, thy might, and come among us; that we, trusting~
only in thy mercy, may by thee be speedily delivered from all adversity 
$Qui vivis

[Ant 3]
John bare witness of Him, * saying He That cometh after me is preferred before~
me.
