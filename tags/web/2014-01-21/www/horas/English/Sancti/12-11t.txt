[Lectio4]
Damasus was a Spaniard, a man of eminence and of great learning in the~
Scriptures, (and was elected to the Chair of Peter in the year~
of our Lord 381) he convoked the First Council of Constantinople,~
wherein he crushed the wicked heresy of Eunomius and Macedonius. He confirmed~
the condemnation of the Assembly, at Rimini, which condemnation had already been~
pronounced by Liberius. This Assembly of Rimini was that in which, to use the~
language of St Jerome, Valens and Ursacius brought it about through trickery~
that the Faith of Nice was abrogated by mob law, and the world afterwards~
groaned in amazement to find itself Arian.

This Pope built two Basilicas, first, St Lawrence's, near Pompey's Theatre,~
which he magnificently enriched, and endowed with houses and farms; and,~
secondly, another, over the Catacombs on the Road to Ardea. He also consecrated~
the Platonia, where the bodies of St Peter and St Paul lay for some time, and~
decorated it with elegant inscriptions in poetry composed by himself. He wrote~
on the subject of virginity both in prose and verse, and likewise many other~
poems on various subjects.

[Lectio6]
He ordained that false accusers should be punished for the offences which they~
had falsely laid to the charge of their neighbours. He established the usage,~
which already prevailed in many churches, of singing the Psalms, both by day and~
by night, by alternate choirs, and of adding at the end of each Psalm the words,~
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. It was at his~
command that St Jerome revised the translation of the New Testament to accord~
with the Greek text. He ruled the Church for seventeen years, two months, and~
twenty-six days. He held five Advent ordinations, wherein he ordained thirty-one~
Priests, eleven Deacons, and sixty-two Bishops for divers Sees. At length he~
fell asleep in the Lord, in the reign of Theodosius the Elder, (upon the 10th~
day of December, in the year 384, being) aged nearly eighty years, and full of~
righteousness, truth, and judgment. He was buried beside his mother and sister~
in the Church which he had himself founded on the Road to Ardea. His reliques~
were afterwards taken to the Basilica of St Lawrence, which is thence sometimes~
called San Lorenzo in Damaso.
