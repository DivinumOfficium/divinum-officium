From the letter of blessed Apostle Paul to the Romans
!Rom 6:2-4
2 God forbid. For we that are dead to sin, how shall we live any longer therein? 
3 Know you not that all we, who are baptized in Christ Jesus, are baptized in his death? 
4 For we are buried together with him by baptism into death; that as Christ is risen from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also may walk in newness of life. 

[Responsory1]
R. The Angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the~
stone, and sat upon it, and said unto the women
* Fear not ye; for I know that ye seek Him That was crucified : He is risen~
already. Come, see the place where the Lord was laid. Alleluia.
V. And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right~
side, clothed in a long white garment, and they were affrighted; and he saith~
unto them :
R. Fear not ye : for I know that ye seek Him That was crucified : He is risen~
already; come, see the place where the Lord was laid. Alleluia.
&Gloria
R. The Angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the~
stone and sat upon it, and said unto the women : Fear not ye : for I know that~
ye seek Him That was crucified : He is risen already : Come, see the place where~
the Lord was laid. Alleluia.

[Lectio2]
!Rom 6:5-7
5 For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection.
6 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin may be destroyed, to the end that we may serve sin no longer. 
7 For he that is dead is justified from sin. 

[Responsory2]
R. When the Sabbath was passed, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James,~
and Salome, had bought sweet spices
* That they might come and anoint Jesus. Alleluia, Alleluia.
V. And very early in the morning, the first day of the week, they came unto the~
sepulchre, at the rising of the sun.
R. That they might come and anoint Jesus. Alleluia, Alleluia.

[Lectio3]
!Rom 6:8-13
8 Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall live also together with Christ:
 9 Knowing that Christ rising again from the dead, dieth now no more, death shall no more have dominion over him. 
10 For in that he died to sin, he died once; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God:
11 So do you also reckon, that you are dead to sin, but alive unto God, in Christ Jesus our Lord. 
12 Let no sin therefore reign in your mortal body, so as to obey the lusts thereof. 
13 Neither yield ye your members as instruments of iniquity unto sin; but present yourselves to God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of justice unto God. 


[Responsory3]
R. Mary Magdalen and the other Mary went very early to the sepulchre.
* That Jesus Whom ye seek, is not here; for He is risen, as He said He goeth~
before you into Galilee; there shall ye see Him.
V. And very early in the morning, the first day of the week, they came unto~
the sepulchre, at the rising of the sun; and, entering into the sepulchre, they~

R. That Jesus Whom ye seek, is not here; for He is risen, as He said He goeth~
before you into Galilee; there shall ye see Him.
&Gloria
R. That Jesus Whom ye seek, is not here; for He is risen, as He said He goeth~

Sermon of St Gregori Nazienzi
!Sermon on Easter
The Passover of the Lord, the Passover, and again, in honour of the Holy~
Trinity, I say the Passover. This is to us the festival of all festivals and the~
celebration of all celebrations, not only among the feasts taht pertain to men~
and are established upon earth, but even among those that belong to Christ~
himself, and are celebrated to His glory, for this feast outshines all others,~
even as the sun out shines the stars. Yesterday the Lamb was slain and the door~
posts anointed, while Egypt bewailed her first born, but the Angel of death has~
passed us by, (for the sign was even to him a thing of terror and awe,) for we~
were protected by the Precious Blood.

[Responsory4]
R. With great power gave the Apostles
* Witness of the Ressurection of Our Lord Jesus Christ, alleluia, alleluia.
V. They were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the Word of God with~
boldness
R. Witness of the Ressurection of Our Lord Jesus Christ, alleluia, alleluia.

[Lectio5]
To-day we leave Egypt utterly behind us, and Pharaoh our cruel master, and his harsh officers; for we are delivered from the clay and the making of bricks. Nor is there any to forbid us to to celebrate it not with the leaven of our former malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth, bringing with us nothing of the unholy leaven of Egypt. Yesterday I shared his death, to-day I am made alive again with him, to-day with him I arise.

[Responsory5] 
R. From the mouth + of the wise proceedeth honey, alleluia, the sweetness of honey is under his tongue, alleluia, 
* His lips drop as the honeycomb, alleluia, alleluia.
V. Wisdom doth abide in his heart, and out of his heart, and out of his mouth cometh understanding 
R. His lips drop as the honeycomb, alleluia, alleluia.

[Lectio6]
Christ took what was lower, in order that he might give us the higher. He became poor that by his poverty we might be made rich. He took upon him the form of a servant, to set us at liberty. He stooped that we may be exalted. He was tempted, that we might overcome. He was despised, that he might bring us to glory. He died, to bring us to salvation. He ascended on high, to draw unto himself those who were sunk in sin. Let a man give all things to him who gave himself for us as the price of redemption and as the subistute for our guilt. Nothing so great, however, can be given in return, as the offering of ourselves, if we rightly understand this mystery, and if we do for his sake, become all things, whatsoever he for our sakes became.

[Responsory6] 
R.I am + the true vine, ye are the branches: 
* He that abideth in me and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit, alleluia, alleluia.
V. As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you.
R. He that abideth in me and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit, alleluia alleluia.
&Gloria
R. He that abideth in me and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit, alleluia, alleluia.

[Lectio7]
From the holy Gospel according to Mark.
!Mark 16:1-7
And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of James, and~
Salome, bought sweet spices, that coming, they might anoint Jesus. And follows.
_
Homily of St. Gregory pope
!Homilia 21. in Evangelia.
Dearly beloved brethren, ye have heard the deed of the holy women which had~
followed the Lord; how that they brought sweet spices to His sepulchre, and, now~
that He was dead, having loved Him while He was yet alive, they followed Him~
with careful tenderness still. But the deed of these holy women doth point to~
somewhat which must needs be done in the holy Church. And it behoveth us well to~
give ear to what they did, that we may afterward consider with ourselves what we~
must do likewise after their ensample. We also, who believe in Him That was dead,~
do come to His sepulchre bearing sweet spices, when we seek the Lord with the~
savour of good living, and the fragrant report of good works. Those women, when~
they brought their spices, saw a vision of Angels, and, in sooth, those souls~
whose godly desires do move them to seek the Lord with the savour of good lives,~
do see the countrymen of our Fatherland which is above.

[Responsory7]
R. They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid Him. The~
Angels say unto her Woman, why weepest thou? He is risen, as He said.
* He goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see Him.
V. And as she wept, she stooped down and looked into the Sepulchre, and saw two~
Angels in white, sitting; and they say unto her
R. He goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see Him.
&Gloria
R. He goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see Him.

[Lectio8]
It behoveth us to mark what this meaneth, that they saw the Angel sitting on the~
right side. For what signifieth the left, but this life which now is? or the~
right, but life everlasting? Whence also it is written in the Song of Songs (ii.~
6) : His left hand is under my head, and His right hand doth embrace me. Since,~
therefore, our Redeemer had passed from the corruption of this life which now is,~
the Angel which told that His undying life was come, sat, as became him, on the~
right side. They saw him clothed in a white garment, for he was herald of the~
joy of this our great solemnity, and the glistering whiteness of his raiment~
told of the brightness of this holy Festival of ours. Of ours, said I? or of~
his? But if we will speak the truth, we must acknowledge that it is both his and~
ours. The Again-rising of our Redeemer is a Festival of gladness for us, for us~
it biddeth know that we shall not die for ever; and for Angels also it is a~
festival of gladness, for it biddeth them know that we are called to fulfil~
their number in heaven.

[Responsory8]
R. Rejoice with me, all ye that love the Lord for I sought Him and He hath~
appeared unto me
* And while as I was weeping at the Sepulchre, I saw the Lord.
V. When His disciples were gone away, I tarried still; and the fire of love in~
my heart yearned after Him.
R. And while as I was weeping at the Sepulchre, I saw the Lord.

[Lectio9]
See this glad Festival then, which is both his and ours, the Angel appeared in~
white raiment. For as the Lord, rising again from the dead, leadeth us unto the~
mansions above, He. repaireth the breaches of the heavenly Fatherland. But what~
meaneth this, that the Angel said unto the women which came to the sepulchre :~
Fear not? Is it not as though he had said openly : Let them fear which love~
not the coming of the heavenly countrymen; let them be afraid who are so laden~
by fleshly lusts, that they have lost all hope ever to be joined to their~
company. But as for you, why fear ye, who, when ye see us, see but your fellow -~
countrymen? Hence also Matthew, writing of the guise of the Angel, saith~
~(xxviii. 3) : His countenance was like lightning, and His raiment white as~
snow. The lightning speaketh of fear and great dread, the snow of the soft~
brilliancy of rejoicing.

[Responsory9]
R. Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be new dough : for even Christ our~
Passover is sacrificed for us :
* Therefore let us keep the Feast, in the Lord. Alleluia.
V. He died for our offences, and rose again for our justification.
R. Therefore let us keep the Feast, in the Lord. Alleluia.
&Gloria
R. Therefore let us keep the Feast, in the Lord. Alleluia.

[Ant Laudes]
For an angel of the Lord * descended from heaven and coming rolled back the stone and sat upon it, alleluia, alleluia.
There was a great earthquake * For an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, alleluia.

V. This is the day which the Lord hath made
R. Let us be glad and rejoice therein,alleluia.

[Ant 2]
And very early in the morning * the first day of the week, they come to the~
sepulchre, the sun being now risen, alleluia.

[Oratio 2]
God, who on this day, through thy Only-begotten Son, overcame death, and opened to us the gate of everlasting life: as by thy anticipating grace, thou breathest good desires into our hearts, so also, by thy gracious help, bring them to good effect.
