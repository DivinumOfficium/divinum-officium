[Oratio]
Do we helpen, O Lord, we beseech thee, by the prayers of thine holy Confessor~
Bruno, that we who by our sins have so grievously offended against thy Majesty,~
may for his sake and at his petition obtain forgiveness of our trespasses.

[Lectio4]
Bruno, the Founder of the Charterhouse Monks, was born at Cologne, (about the~
year of our Lord 1030.) From his earliest years he was a very grave child,~
turning away from childish things, and that so manifestly, that by the grace of~
God the tokens of holiness already pointed him out as a Father of monks, and a~
restorer of the life of hermits. His parents, who were eminent for rank and~
goodness, sent him to Paris, where he studied so well in Philosophy and Theology,~
that he took the degree of Doctor in both faculties; and a short while after,~
for his famous graces, he was made a Canon of Rheims.

[Lectio5]
After some years, he, and six comrades, forsook the world and betook themselves~
to Hew, the holy Bishop of Grenoble, who, when he learned the reason of their~
coming, and believing them to have been figured by seven stars which he had seen~
that night in a dream falling at his feet, gave them a grant of land in some~
very wild mountains in his Dioecese, which are called the Chartreuses. Thither~
Bruno and his companions, together with Hew, withdrew themselves, (in the year~
1084,) and led for some years the life of hermits. Pope Urban II., who had~
formerly been his disciple (at Rheims,) commanded him to come to Rome, (in 1089,)~
and amid the afflictions which then scourged the Church, held him for some time~
as his counsellor. But at last Bruno, who had refused the Archbishoprick of~
Reggio, got his leave to go away.

[Lectio6]
In his love of the wilderness, he betook himself to a certain desert place in~
the Dicecese of Squillaci, in the uttermost coasts of Calabria, (whither he went~
in 1090.) He was praying there one day in a cave, when the hounds of Roger,~
Sovereign Earl of Sicily and Calabria, who was out a-hunting, came and bayed at~
the door of it. Thus was he found by this Prince, who was moved by his holiness,~
and began to cherish him and his comrades, and treat them very kindly. The~
Earl's goodness was rewarded, for when he was one time laying siege to Capua,~
and one Sergius, who was first groom of his bedchamber, had made a plot to~
betray him, Bruno, who was still living in the desert above mentioned, appeared~
to him in a dream, and delivered him from the danger which was hanging over him.~
At length Bruno, full of graces and good works, and famous for godliness not~
less than for learning, fell asleep in the Lord, (upon the 6th day of October,~
in the year 1101,) and was buried in the monastery of St Stephen, founded by the~
same Earl Roger, where he is still held in great honour.

[Lectio94]
Bruno, the founder of the Carthausian Order, was born at Cologne. From his~
boyhood he excelled in the soberness of his ways and his desire for solitude~
parents sent him to Paris, and there he made such progress in the studv of~
philosophy and theology that he earned the degree of doctor and master in both~
faculties. Not long after, because of outstanding virtues he was anointed a~
Canon of the church Rheims. Having founded the Carthusian Order and having led a~
hermit's life in this Order for some years, he was summoned to Rome by Urban II,~
who had been his disciple. In those calamitous times, the Pope made use of~
Bruno's counsel and learning for several years. Finally the man of God, who had~
refused the archbishopric of Rheims, was allowed to depart. He again sought a~
Place of solitude, and there, full of virtutes and merits, he fell asleep in the~
Lord.
