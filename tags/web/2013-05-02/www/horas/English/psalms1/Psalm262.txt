(Canticum Jeremiae * Jer 7:2-7)
7:2 Stand in the gate of the house of the Lord, and proclaim there this word, and say: Hear ye the word of the Lord, all ye men of Juda, that enter in at these gates, to adore the Lord.
7:3 Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Make your ways and your doings good: and I will dwell with you in this place.
7:4 Trust not in lying words, saying: The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, it is the temple of the Lord.
7:5 For if you will order well your ways, and your doings: if you will execute judgement between a man and his neighbor,
7:6 If you opress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, and walk not after strange gods to your own hurt,
7:7 I will dwell with you in this place: in the land, which I gave to your fathers from the beginning and for evermore.
