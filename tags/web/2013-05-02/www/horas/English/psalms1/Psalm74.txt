74:1 We will praise thee, O God: * we will praise, and we will call upon thy name.
74:2 We will relate thy wondrous works: * when I shall take a time, I will judge justices.
74:3 The earth is melted, and all that dwell therein: * I have established the pillars thereof.
74:4 I said to the wicked: Do not act wickedly: * and to the sinners: Lift not up the horn.
74:5 Lift not up your horn on high: * speak not iniquity against God.
74:6 For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the desert hills: * for God is the judge.
74:7 One he putteth down, and another he lifteth up: * for in the hand of the Lord there is a cup of strong wine full of mixture.
74:8 And he hath poured it out from this to that: but the dregs thereof are not emptied: * all the sinners of the earth shall drink.
74:9 But I will declare for ever: * I will sing to the God of Jacob.
74:10 And I will break all the horns of sinners: * but the horns of the just shall be exalted.
