88:1 The mercies of the Lord * I will sing for ever.
88:2 I will shew forth thy truth with my mouth * to generation and generation.
88:3 For thou hast said: Mercy shall be built up for ever in the heavens: * thy truth shall be prepared in them.
88:4 I have made a covenant with my elect: I have sworn to David my servant: * Thy seed will I settle for ever.
88:5 And I will build up thy throne * unto generation and generation.
88:6 The heavens shall confess thy wonders, O Lord: * and thy truth in the church of the saints.
88:7 For who in the clouds can be compared to the Lord: * or who among the sons of God shall be like to God?
88:8 God, who is glorified in the assembly of the saints: * great and terrible above all them that are about him.
88:9 O Lord God of hosts, who is like to thee? * thou art mighty, O Lord, and thy truth is round about thee.
88:10 Thou rulest the power of the sea: * and appeasest the motion of the waves thereof.
88:11 Thou hast humbled the proud one, as one that is slain: * with the arm of thy strength thou hast scattered thy enemies.
88:12 Thine are the heavens, and thine is the earth: the world and the fulness thereof thou hast founded: * the north and the sea thou hast created.
88:13 Thabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name: * thy arm is with might.
88:14 Let thy hand be strengthened, and thy right hand exalted: * justice and judgment are the preparation of thy throne.
88:15 Mercy and truth shall go before thy face: * blessed is the people that knoweth jubilation.
88:16 They shall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance: and in thy name they shall rejoice all the day, * and in thy justice they shall be exalted.
88:17 For thou art the glory of their strength: * and in thy good pleasure shall our horn be exalted.
88:18 For our protection is of the Lord, * and of our king the holy one of Israel.
88:20 Then thou spokest in a vision to thy saints, and saidst: * I have laid help upon one that is mighty, and have exalted one chosen out of my people. 
88:21 I have found David my servant: * with my holy oil I have anointed him.
88:22 For my hand shall help him: * and my arm shall strengthen him.
88:23 The enemy shall have no advantage over him: * nor the son of iniquity have power to hurt him.
88:24 And I will cut down his enemies before his face; * and them that hate him I will put to flight.
88:25 And my truth and my mercy shall be with him: * and in my name shall his horn be exalted.
88:26 And I will set his hand in the sea; * and his right hand in the rivers.
88:27 He shall cry out to me: Thou art my father: * my God, and the support of my salvation.
88:28 And I will make him my firstborn, * high above the kings of the earth.
88:29 I will keep my mercy for him for ever: * and my covenant faithful to him.
88:30 And I will make his seed to endure for evermore: * and his throne as the days of heaven.
88:31 And if his children forsake my law, * and walk not in my judgments: 
88:32 If they profane my justices: * and keep not my commandments:
88:33 I will visit their iniquities with a rod: *and their sins with stripes. 
88:34 But my mercy I will not take away from him: * nor will I suffer my truth to fail.
88:35 Neither will I profane my covenant: * and the words that proceed from my mouth I will not make void.
88:36 Once have I sworn by my holiness: I will not lie unto David: * his seed shall endure for ever.
88:37 And his throne as the sun before me: * and as the moon perfect for ever, and a faithful witness in heaven.
