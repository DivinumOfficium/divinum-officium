(Canticum David 1 Par 29:10-13)
10 Blessed art thou, O Lord the God of Israel, our father from eternity to eternity.
11 Thine, O Lord, is magnificence, and power, and glory, and victory: and to thee is praise: for all that is in heaven, and in earth, is thine: thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art above all princes. 
12 Thine are riches, and thine is glory, thou hast dominion over all, in thy hand is power and might: in thy hand greatness, and the empire of all things. 
13 Now therefore our God we give thanks to thee, and we praise thy glorious name.
