Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 9:1-38
In that time Jesus passing by, saw a man, who was blind from his birth. And so~
on.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!44th Tract on John.
Dread and wondrous are all the things which our Lord Jesus Christ did, both His~
works and His words; the works, because He wrought them; the words, because they~
are deep. If, therefore, we consider the meaning of this work of His, we see~
that that man which was blind from his birth was a figure of mankind. This~
spiritual blindness was the consequence of the sin of the first man, from whom~
we all inherit by birth, not death only, but depravity also. For if blindness be~
unbelief, and faith, light, whom, when Christ came, did He find faithful? May,~
the Apostle who had himself been born of the race of which the Prophets came,~
saith We also were by nature children of wrath, even as others. (Eph. ii. 3.)~
And if children of wrath, then children also of vengeance, children of damnation,~
children of hell. And wherefore so by nature, unless it were that the sin of the~
first man had made all his descendants to be born in sin, in that they partook~
of his nature? If, then, our nature bring sin with it, all men, according to the~
spirit, are born blind.

The Lord came; and what did He? He set before us a great mystery. Jesus spat on~
the ground, and made clay of the Spittle for the Word was made flesh. And He~
anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay but yet that man saw not. He~
was anointed, indeed, but yet still he saw not. And He said unto him Go, wash~
in the Pool of Siloam. Now, it was the duty of the Evangelist to impress upon us~
the name of this Pool, and therefore he saith Siloam, which is, by~
interpretation, Sent. Ye, my brethren, know Who is signified where it is~
written: (The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a law-giver from his~
loins, until) He that shall be Sent (cometh.) (Gen. xlix. 10.) Yea, He it is,~
Who, if He had not been sent, we had never been sent loose out of the~
prison-house of sin. The blind man went his way therefore, and washed his eyes~
in that Pool, which is, by interpretation, Sent in other words, he was baptized~
in Christ. When, therefore, he had figuratively been baptized in Him Whom the~
Father hath Sent into the world he came seeing. When he was anointed, he was~
perchance made a figure of a Catechumen. 1

[Lectio3]
We have heard this great mystery. Ask of a man: Art thou a Christian? He~
answereth thee I am not. Then, if thou ask him: Art thou a pagan then, or a~
Jew? And he still saith unto thee Nay and thou say Art thou then a~
Catechumen, though not yet one of the faithful? and he saith Yea, a Catechumen~
then there thou seest a man anointed, but not yet washed. With what hath he been~
anointed? Ask of him, and he will tell thee. Ask of him in Whom he believeth,~
and, being a Catechumen, he will say: In Christ. But, behold, I speak before~
both Faithful and Catechumens. What said I touching the. Spittle and the clay? I~
said for 'the Word was made flesh.' This the Catechumens hear, but it is not~
enough for them to be anointed; they must make haste to the washing, if they~
would have their eyes opened. 2

[Ant 2]
Rabbi, who did sin, this man, or his parents, * that he was born blind? Jesus~
answered, and said Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents; but that the~
works of God shall be made manifest in him.

[Oratio 2]
O God, Who by mean of fasting dost give unto the righteous the reward of their~
good works, and unto sinners pardon; have mercy upon us, we beseech thee, and~
grant that we, humbly confessing our guiltiness, may so be enabled to obtain thy~
forgiveness.
$Per Dominum.

[Ant 3]
The Man that is called Jesus * made clay of His Spittle, and anointed mine eyes,~
and now I do see.

[Oratio 3]
Let thy merciful ears, O Lord, be open unto the prayers of all them that entreat~
thee, and that Thou mayest grant us ever such things as we ask, teach us ever to~
ask such things as are pleasing in thy sight.

[LectioE]
Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 9:1-38
9:1 AND Jesus passing by, saw a man, who was blind from his birth:
9:2 And his disciples asked him: Rabbi, who hath sinned, this man, or his parents, that he should be born blind?
9:3 Jesus answered: Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents; but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.
9:4 I must work the works of him that sent me, whilst it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.
9:5 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
9:6 When he had said these things, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and spread the clay on his eyes,
9:7 And said to him: Go, wash in the pool of Siloe, which is interpreted, Sent. He went therefore, and washed, and he came seeing.
9:8 The neighbours therefore, and they who had seen him before that he was a beggar, said: Is not this he that sat and begged? Some said: This is he.
9:9 But others said: No, but he is like him. But he said: I am he.
9:10 They said therefore to him: How were thy eyes opened?
9:11 He answered: That man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me: Go to the pool of Siloe, and wash. And I went, I washed, and I see.
9:12 And they said to him: Where is he? He saith: I know not.
9:13 They bring him that had been blind to the Pharisees.
9:14 Now it was the sabbath, when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.
9:15 Again therefore the Pharisees asked him, how he had received his sight. But he said to them: He put clay upon my eyes, and I washed, and I see.
9:16 Some therefore of the Pharisees said: This man is not of God, who keepeth not the sabbath. But others said: How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.
9:17 They say therefore to the blind man again: What sayest thou of him that hath opened they eyes? And he said: He is a prophet.
9:18 The Jews then did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight,
9:19 And asked them, saying: Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then doth he now see?
9:20 His parents answered them, and said: We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:
9:21 But how he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: ask himself: he is of age, let him speak for himself.
9:22 These things his parents said, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had already agreed among themselves, that if any man should confess him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
9:23 Therefore did his parents say: He is of age, ask himself.
9:24 They therefore called the man again that had been blind, and said to him: Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.
9:25 He said therefore to them: If he be a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I see.
9:26 They said then to him: What did he to thee? How did he open thy eyes?
9:27 He answered them: I have told you already, and you have heard: why would you hear it again? will you also become his disciples?
9:28 They reviled him therefore, and said: Be thou his disciple; but we are the disciples of Moses.
9:29 We know that God spoke to Moses: but as to this man, we know not from whence he is.
9:30 The man answered, and said to them: Why, herein is a wonderful thing, that you know not from whence he is, and he hath opened my eyes.
9:31 Now we know that God doth not hear sinners: but if a man be a server of God, and doth his will, him he heareth.
9:32 From the beginning of the world it hath not been heard, that any man hath opened the eyes of one born blind.
9:33 Unless this man were of God, he could not do any thing.
9:34 They answered, and said to him: Thou wast wholly born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.
9:35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out: and when he had found him, he said to him: Dost thou believe in the Son of God?
9:36 He answered, and said: Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?
9:37 And Jesus said to him: Thou hast both seen him; and it is he that talketh with thee.
9:38 And he said: I believe, Lord. And falling down, he adored him.
