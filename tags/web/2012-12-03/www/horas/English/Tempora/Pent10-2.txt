Lesson from the second book of Kings
!2 Kgs 12:1-3
1 In the seventh year of Jehu Joas began to reign: and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Sebia of Bersabee.
2 And Joas did that which was right before the Lord all the days that Joiada the priest taught him.
3 But yet he took not away the high places: for the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.

4 And Joas said to the priests: O All the money of the sanctified things, which is brought into the temple of the Lord by those that pass, which is offered for the price of a soul, and which of their own accord, and of their own free heart they bring into the temple of the Lord:
5 Let the priests take it according to their order, and repair the house, wheresoever they shall see any thing that wanteth repairing.

6 Now till the three and twentieth year of king Joas, the priests did not make the repairs of the temple.
7 And king Joas called Joiada the high priest and the priests, saying to them: Why do you not repair the temple? Take you therefore money no more according to your order, but restore it for the repairing of the temple.
8 And the priests were forbidden to take any more money of the people, and to make the repairs of the house
