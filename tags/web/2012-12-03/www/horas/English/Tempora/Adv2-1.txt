Lesson from the book of Isaias
!Isa 13:1-4
1 The burden of Babylon, which Isaias the son of Amos saw.
2 Upon the dark mountain lift ye up a banner, exalt the voice, lift up the hand, and let the rulers go into the gates.
3 I have commanded my sanctified ones, and have called my strong ones in my wrath, them that rejoice in my glory.
4 The noise of a multitude in the mountains, as it were of many people, the noise of the sound of kings, of nations gathered together.

!Isa 13:4-8
4 The Lord of hosts hath given charge to the troops of war.
5 To them that come from a country afar off, from the end of heaven: the Lord and the instruments of his wrath, to destroy the whole land.
6 Howl ye, for the day of the Lord is near: it shall come as a destruction from the Lord.
7 Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every heart of man shall melt,
8 And shall be broken. Gripings and pains shall take hold of them, they shall be~
in pain as a woman in labour. Every one shall be amazed at his neighbour, their countenances shall be as faces burnt.

!Isa 13:9-11
9 Behold, the day of the Lord shall come, a cruel day, and full of indignation, and of wrath, and fury, to lay the land desolate, and to destroy the sinners thereof out of it.
10 For the stars of heaven, and their brightness shall not display their light: the sun shall be darkened in his rising, and the moon shall not shine with her light.
11 And I will visit the evils of the world, and against the wicked for their iniquity: and I will make the pride of infidels to cease, and will bring down the arrogancy of the mighty.
