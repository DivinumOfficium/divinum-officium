Lesson from the first book of Samuel
!1 Sam 15:1-3
1 And Samuel said to Saul: The Lord sent me to anoint thee king over his People~
Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the Lord:
2 Thus saith the Lord of hosts: I have reckoned up all that Amalec hath done to~
Israel: I how he opposed them in the way when they came up out of Egypt.
3 Now therefore go, and smite Amalec, and utterly destroy all that he hath:~
spare him not, nor covet any thing that is his: but slay both man and woman,~
child and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.

!1 Sam 15:4-8
4 So Saul commanded the people, and numbered them as lambs: two hundred thousand~
footmen, and ten thousand of the men of Juda.
5 And when Saul was come to the city of Amalec, he laid ambushes in the torrent.
6 And Saul said to the Cinite: Go, depart and get ye down from Amalec: lest I~
destroy thee with him. For thou hast shown kindness to all the children of~
Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. And the Cinite departed from the midst~
of Amalec.
7 And Saul smote Amalec from Hevila, until thou comest to Sur, which is over~
against Egypt.
8 And he took Agag the king of Amalec alive: but all the common people he slew~
with the edge of the sword

!1 Sam 15:9-11
9 And Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the flocks of sheep and of~
the herds, and the garments and the rams, and all that was beautiful, and would~
not destroy them: but every thing that was vile and good for nothing, that they~
destroyed.
10 And the word of the Lord came to Samuel, saying:
11 It repenteth me that I have made Saul king: for he hath forsaken me, and hath~
not executed my commandments. And Samuel was grieved, and he cried unto the Lord~
all night.
