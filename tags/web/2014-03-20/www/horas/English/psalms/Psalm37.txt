37:1 (A psalm for David, for a remembrance of the sabbath.)
37:2 Rebuke me not, O Lord, in thy indignation; nor chastise me in thy wrath.
37:3 For thy arrows are fastened in me: and thy hand hath been strong upon me.
37:4 There is no health in my flesh, because of thy wrath: there is no peace for my bones, because of my sins.
37:5 For my iniquities are gone over my head: and as a heavy burden are become heavy upon me.
37:6 My sores are putrified and corrupted, because of my foolishness.
37:7 I am become miserable, and am bowed down even to the end: I walked sorrowful all the day long.
37:8 For my loins are filled with illusions; and there is no health in my flesh.
37:9 I am afflicted and humbled exceedingly: I roared with the groaning of my heart.
37:10 Lord, all my desire is before thee, and my groaning is not hidden from thee.
37:11 My heart is troubled, my strength hath left me, and the light of my eyes itself is not with me.
37:12 My friends and my neighbours have drawn near, and stood against me. And they that were near me stood afar off:
37:13 And they that sought my soul used violence. And they that sought evils to me spoke vain things, and studied deceits all the day long.
37:14 But I, as a deaf man, heard not: and as a dumb man not opening his mouth.
37:15 And I became as a man that heareth not: and that hath no reproofs in his mouth.
37:16 For in thee, O Lord, have I hoped: thou wilt hear me, O Lord my God.
37:17 For I said: Lest at any time my enemies rejoice over me: and whilst my feet are moved, they speak great things against me.
37:18 For I am ready for scourges: and my sorrow is continually before me.
37:19 For I will declare my iniquity: and I will think for my sin.
37:20 But my enemies live, and are stronger than I: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.
37:21 They that render evil for good, have detracted me, because I followed goodness.
37:22 Forsake me not, O Lord my God: do not thou depart from me.
37:23 Attend unto my help, O Lord, the God of my salvation.
