From the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 8:36-50
At that time One of the Pharisees desired Jesus that He would eat with him.~
And He went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat. And so on.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great.)
!33rd on the Gospels.
Of what is the Pharisee that was exalted by self-righteousness a type, but of~
the Jewish people And of what the woman which was a sinner and came and wept~
at the Lord's feet, but of the conversion of the Gentiles She brought an~
alabaster box of ointment, and stood at His feet behind Him weeping, and began~
to wash His Feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and~
kissed His Feet, and anointed them with the ointment. Of us, therefore, even of~
us, was that woman a type, if after our sins we turn unto the Lord with all our~
heart, and imitate the example of her repentant grief. And of what is the~
ointment a type, but of the sweet savour of a good reputation Whence also Paul~
saith (God maketh manifest the savour of His knowledge by us) in every place~
~(for) we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ. (2 Cor. ii. 15.)

If therefore we do good works, whereby we gain for the Church the savour of good~
reputation, what do we but pour ointment upon the body of the Lord But the~
woman stood at the Feet of Jesus, behind Him we stood opposite to the Feet of~
the Lord, what time we were in sin, and went contrary unto His ways. But when we~
turn again, and truly repent us of our sins, we stand behind His Feet, for we~
follow His footsteps against Whom we once contended. The woman washed His Feet~
with her tears and we do in very deed the same when we show the tenderness of~
sympathy to any of His humbler members, when we feel with His Saints in their~
tribulations, when we make their woes our own.

She wipe the Lord's Feet with our hair when we give charity, even out of such~
things as we have ourselves no need of, to His holy ones, with whom we feel in~
their trials, in as far as our heart so sympathizeth, that the bounty of our~
hand showeth the truth of our compassion. He washeth the Feet of the Redeemer,~
but wipeth them not with his hair, who feeleth for the sufferings of his~
neighbours, but nevertheless, relieveth them not, even out of such things as he~
himself hath no need for. He weepeth, but wipeth not, who offereth words of~
tenderness, but sootheth not sorrow by giving such things as be lacking. The~
woman kissed the Feet and we do fully the same, if we warmly love those whom~
out of bounty we support, so that the neediness of our neighbour is not grievous~
unto us, nor the penury which we relieve a weariness to us, nor, when the hand~
is giving what is needful, the heart is untouched by compassion.

and began to wash His Feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her~

soul.

v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 7:36-50
7:36 And one of the Pharisees desired him to eat with him. And he went into the house of the Pharisee, and sat down to meat.
7:37 And behold a woman that was in the city, a sinner, when she knew that he sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment;
7:38 And standing behind at his feet, she began to wash his feet, with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.
7:39 And the Pharisee, who had invited him, seeing it, spoke within himself, saying: This man, if he were a prophet, would know surely who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him, that she is a sinner.
7:40 And Jesus answering, said to him: Simon, I have somewhat to say to thee. But he said: Master, say it.
7:41 A certain creditor had two debtors, the one who owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.
7:42 And whereas they had not wherewith to pay, he forgave them both. Which therefore of the two loveth him most?
7:43 Simon answering, said: I suppose that he to whom he forgave most. And he said to him: Thou hast judged rightly.
7:44 And turning to the woman, he said unto Simon: Dost thou see this woman? I entered into thy house, thou gavest me no water for my feet; but she with tears hath washed my feet, and with her hairs hath wiped them.
7:45 Thou gavest me no kiss; but she, since she came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet.
7:46 My head with oil thou didst not anoint; but she with ointment hath anointed my feet.
7:47 Wherefore I say to thee: Many sins are forgiven her, because she hath loved much. But to whom less is forgiven, he loveth less.
7:48 And he said to her: Thy sins are forgiven thee.
7:49 And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves: Who is this that forgiveth sins also?
7:50 And he said to the woman: Thy faith hath made thee safe, go in peace.
