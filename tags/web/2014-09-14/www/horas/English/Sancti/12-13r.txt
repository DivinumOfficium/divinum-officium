$Per Dominum

[Responsory1]
R. Maiden Lucy, why seekest thou of me that which thou thyself canst presently~
give thy mother? For thy faith hath holpen her, and, behold, she is made whole
* Because thou hast made in thy virginity a pleasant dwelling-place for thy God.
V. Even as Christ hath by me glorified Catania, so by thee shall He glorify~
Syracuse.
R. Because thou hast made in thy virginity a pleasant dwellingplace for thy God.

[Responsory2]
R. I besought my Lord Jesus Christ that this fire might not take hold upon me
* And I obtained from the Lord that I should not finish my testimony for yet a~
while.
V. For so much as they loved me, so bitterly spake they against me: but I gave~
myself unto prayer. 
R. And I obtained from the Lord that I should not finish my testimony for yet a~
while.

sight of God and man she spake wisdom before princes
* And the Lord of all loved her.

not be moved.
R. And the Lord of all loved her.

Through thee, O virgin Lucy, * the city of Syracuse shall be made glorious by the Lord Jesus Christ.
I bless thee, * O Father of my Lord Jesus Christ, for through thy Son the fire was extinguished round about me.
Lucy my sister, * thou virgin consecrated to God, wherefore askest thou of me what thou canst thyself forthwith obtain for thy mother?

all the people wait for thee, until thou receive the crown of life, alleluia.

[Ant 3]
With such power * did the Holy Spirit fix her to the ground, that the virgin of~
Christ remained immovable.

[Lectio94]
Lucy a virgin of Syracuse, noble by birth and by her Christian faith, went to~
the tomb of St. Agatha at Catheria and obtained the cure of her mother, Eutichia~
who was suffering from a hemorrhage. Soon after, she gained her mother's~
permission to distribute to the poor all the possessions which were to have~
served as her dowry. As a result of this charitable action, she was accused of~
being a Christian and brought before Paschasius the Prefect. When neither~
promises nor threats could induce her to sacrifice the idols, Paschasius became~
enraged and commanded Lucy to be taken to a place where her virginity would be~
violated. But the power of God gave the virgin a strength that matched the~
firmness of her resolution, so that no force could move her where she stood. And~
so the prefect commanded a fire to be kindled all around here, but the flames~
did not harm her. After she had suffered many torments, therefore her throat was~
pierced through with a sword. So wounded she foretold that the Church would have~
peace after the deaths of Diocletian and Maximilian, and on December 13 she gave~
up her spirit to God. Her body was first buried at Syracuse, than taken to~
Constantinople, and finally transferred to Venice.
