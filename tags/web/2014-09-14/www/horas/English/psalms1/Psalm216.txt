(Canticle from_the_Ecclesiasticus * Sir 36:1-16)
36:1 Have mercy upon us, O God of all, and behold us, * and shew us the light of thy mercies:
36:2 And send thy fear upon the nations, * that have not sought after thee:
36:3 That they may know that there is no God beside thee, * and that they may shew forth thy wonders.
36:4 Lift up thy hand over the strange nations, * that they may see thy power.
36:5 For as thou hast been sanctified in us in their sight, * so thou shalt be magnified among them in our presence,
36:6 That they may know thee, as we also have known thee, * that there is no God beside thee, O Lord.
36:7 Renew thy signs, and work new miracles. * Glorify thy hand, and thy right arm.
36:8 Raise up indignation, and pour out wrath. * Take away the adversary, and crush the enemy.
36:9 Hasten the time, and remember the end, * that they may declare thy wonderful works.
36:10 Let him that escapeth be consumed by the rage of the fire: * and let them perish that oppress thy people.
36:11 Crush the head of the princes of the enemies * that say: There is no other beside us.
36:12 Gather together all the tribes of Jacob: that they may know that there is no God besides thee, * and may declare thy great works.
36:13 And thou shalt inherit them * as from the beginning.
36:14 Have mercy on thy people, upon whom thy name is invoked: * and upon Israel, whom thou hast raised up to be thy firstborn.
36:15 Have mercy on Jerusalem, the city which thou hast sanctified, * the city of thy rest.
36:16 Fill Sion with thy unspeakable words, * and thy people with thy glory.
