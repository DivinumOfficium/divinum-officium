heaven by His Presence.

[Lectio1]
From the letter of blessed Apostle Paul to the Romans
!Rom 5:1-5
5:1 Being justified therefore by faith, let us have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ:
5:2 By whom also we have access through faith into this grace, wherein we stand, and glory in the hope of the glory of the sons of God.
5:3 And not only so; but we glory also in tribulations, knowing that tribulation worketh patience;
5:4 And patience trial; and trial hope;
5:5 And hope confoundeth not: because the charity of God is poured forth in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost, who is given to us.

!Rom 5:6-9
 5:6 For why did Christ, when as yet we were weak, according to the time, die for the ungodly?
5:7 For scarce for a just man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man some one would dare to die.
5:8 But God commendeth his charity towards us; because when as yet we were sinners, according to the time,
5:9 Christ died for us; much more therefore, being now justified by his blood, shall we be saved from wrath through him.

!Rom 5:10-12
5:10 For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son; much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.
5:11 And not only so; but also we glory in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received reconciliation.
5:12 Wherefore as by one man sin entered into this world, and by sin death; and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned.
