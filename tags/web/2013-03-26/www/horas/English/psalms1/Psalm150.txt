150:1 Praise ye the Lord in his holy places: * praise ye him in the firmament of his power.
150:2 Praise ye him for his mighty acts: * praise ye him according to the multitude of his greatness.
150:3 Praise him with sound of trumpet: * praise him with psaltery and harp.
150:4 Praise him with timbrel and choir: * praise him with strings and organs.
150:5 Praise him on high sounding cymbals: praise him on cymbals of joy: * let every spirit praise the Lord.
