Lesson from the first book of Kings
!1 Kgs 10:1-3
1 And the queen of Saba, having; heard of the fame of Solomon in the name of the~
Lord, came to try him with hard questions.
2 And entering into Jerusalem with a great train, and riches, and camels that~
carried spices, and an immense quantity of gold, and precious stones, she came~
to king Solomon, and spoke to him all that she had in her heart.
3 And Solomon informed her of all the things she proposed to him: there was not~
any word the king was ignorant of, and which he could not answer her

!1 Kgs 10:4-7
4 And when the queen of Saba saw all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house which~
he had built,
5 And the meat of his table, and the apartments of his servants, and the order~
of his ministers, and their apparel, and the cupbearers, and the holocausts,~
which he offered in the house of the Lord: she had no longer any spirit in her,
6 And she said to the king: The report is true, which I heard in my own country,
7 Concerning thy words, and concerning thy wisdom. And I did not believe them~
that told me, till I came myself, and saw with my own eyes, and have found that~
the half hath not been told me: thy wisdom and thy works, exceed the fame which I~
heard.

8 Blessed are thy men, and blessed are thy servants, who stand before thee~
always, and hear thy wisdom.
9 Blessed be the Lord thy God, whom thou hast pleased, and who hath set thee~
upon the throne of Israel, because the Lord hath loved Israel for ever, and hath~
appointed thee king, to do judgment and justice.
10 And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices a~
very great store, and precious stones: there was brought no more such abundance~
of spices as these which the queen of Saba gave to king Solomon.
11 (The navy also of Hiram, which brought gold from Ophir, brought from Ophir~
great plenty of thyine trees, and precious stones.
