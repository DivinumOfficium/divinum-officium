12 And Joachin king of Juda went out to the king of Babylon, he and his mother,~
and his servants, and his nobles, and his eunuchs: and the king of Babylon~
received him in the eighth year of his reign.
13 And he brought out from thence all the treasures of the house of the Lord,~
and the treasures of the king's house: and he cut in pieces all the vessels of~
gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the Lord, according~
to the word of the Lord.
14 And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the valiant~
men of the army, to the number of ten thousand into captivity: and every~
artificer and smith: and none were left, but the poor sort of the people of the~
land
