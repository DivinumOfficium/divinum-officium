Lesson from the book of Wisdom
!Wis 10:10-14
The Lord guided the just in direct ways, showed him the kingdom of God, and gave him knowledge of holy things. He prospered him in his labors and made abundant the fruit of his works, stood by him against the greed of his defrauders, and enriched him; He preserved him from foes, and secured him against ambush, and He gave him the prize for his stern struggle that he might recognize that devotion to God is mightier than all else. He did not abandon the just man when he was sold, but delivered him from sin. He went down with him into the dungeon, and did not desert him in his bonds, until He brought him the scepter of royalty and authority over his oppressors, and showed those who had defamed him false; and the Lord our God gave him eternal glory.

[Graduale]
!Ps 111:1-2
Happy the man who fears the Lord, who greatly delights in His commands.
V. His posterity shall be mighty upon the earth; the upright generation shall be~
blessed. Alleluia, alleluia.
!Ps 20:4
V. You placed on his head, O Lord, a crown of pure gold. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 10:34-42
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples, Do not think that I have come to send~
peace upon the earth; I have come to bring a sword, not peace. For I have come~
to set a man at variance with his father, and a daughter with her mother, and a~
daughter-in-law with her mother-in-law; and a man’s enemies will be those of his~
own household. He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me;~
and he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me. And he who~
does not take up his cross and follow Me, is not worthy of Me. he who finds his~
life will lose it, and he who loses his life for My sake, will find it. He who~
receives you, receives Me; and he who receives Me, receives Him Who sent Me. He~
who receives a prophet because he is a prophet, shall receive a prophet’s reward;~
and he who receives a just man because he is a just man, shall receive a just~
man’s reward. And whoever gives to one of these little ones but a cup of cold~
water to drink because he is a disciple, amen I say to you, he shall not lose~
his reward.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 8:6-7
You crowned him with glory and honor. You have given him rule over the works of~
Your hands, O Lord.

[Secreta]
Now that You have received our gifts and prayers, we beseech You, O Lord,~
cleanse us by Your heavenly mysteries and in Your mercy, hear us.

[Communio]
!Matt 16:24
Whoever wishes to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross,~
and follow Me.

[Postcommunio]
Grant, we beseech You, O Lord our God, that we who in this life joyously assist~
in the veneration of Your Saints, may rejoice in beholding them forever in~
heaven.
