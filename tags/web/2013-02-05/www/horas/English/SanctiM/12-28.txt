De Jeremia Propheta.
!Jer 31:15-17
15 Thus saith the Lord: A voice was heard on high of lamentation, of mourning,~
and weeping, of Rachel weeping for her children, and refusing to be comforted~
for them, because they are not.
16 Thus saith the Lord: Let thy voice cease from weeping, and thy eyes from~
tears: for there is a reward for thy work, saith the Lord: and they shall return~
out of the land of the enemy.
17 And here is hope for thy last end, saith the Lord: and the children shall~
return to their own borders.

[Responsory1]

!Jer 31:18-20
18 Hearing I heard Ephraim when he went into captivity: thou hast chastised me,~
and I was instructed, as a young bullock unaccustomed to the yoke. Convert me,~
and I shall be converted, for thou art the Lord my God.
19 For after thou didst convert me, I did penance: and after thou didst shew~
unto me, I struck my thigh: I am confounded and ashamed, because I have borne~
the reproach of my youth.
20 Surely Ephraim is an honourable son to me, surely he is a tender child: for~
since I spoke of him, I will still remember him. Therefore are my bowels~
troubled for him: pitying I will pity him, saith the Lord.

[Responsory2]
R. I heard under the altar the voices of them that were slain, saying
* How long dost Thou not avenge our blood? And it was said unto them from God~
Rest yet for a little season, until the number of your brethren be fulfilled.
V. I saw under the altar of God the souls of them that were slain for the Word~
of God, and for the testimony which they held, and they cried with a loud voice,~
saying
R. How long dost Thou not avenge our blood? And it was said unto them from God~
Rest yet for a little season, until the number of your brethren be fulfilled.

[Lectio3]
!Jer 31:21-23
21 Set thee up a watchtower, make to thee bitterness: direct thy heart into the~
right way, wherein thou hast walked: return, O virgin of Israel, return to these~
thy cities.
22 How long wilt thou be dissolute in deliciousness, O wandering daughter? for~
the Lord hath created a new thing upon the earth: A WOMAN SHALL COMPASS A MAN.
23 Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: As yet shall they say this~
word in the land of Juda, and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring back~
their captivity: The Lord bless thee, the beauty of justice, the holy mountain.
