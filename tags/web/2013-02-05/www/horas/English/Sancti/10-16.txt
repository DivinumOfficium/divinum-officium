[Oratio]
O God, Who didst teach thy blessed hand-maid Hedwiga to turn away from the glory~
of the world, and with all her heart to take up her Cross and follow thee, teach~
us, for her sake and after her ensample, to hold light the perishing pleasures~
of this present world, and cleaving ever unto thy Cross to rest in the end more~
than conquerors over all things that would hurt us.

For the confession of Blessed Hedwig * let us praise our God. 

[Lectio4]
Hedwiga, a Princess, in whom the splendour of her family was outshone by the~
radiant innocency of her life, was the daughter of Bertold and Agnes, Marquess~
and Marchioness of Moravia, and sister to Gertrude, wife of Andrew, King of~
Hungary, and mother of the holy Elizabeth of Thuringia. From her earliest~
childhood she was a very grave child, and had already done with childish things~
when, at twelve years of age, she was given in marriage by her father and mother~
to Henry, Grand Prince of Poland. In marriage she kept the bed in all holiness~
undefined, and brought up in the fear of God the children that were therein~
begotten of her. (After the birth of her sixth child,) she was fain to give~
herself more continually to God, and induced her husband to agree to a mutual~
vow of separation of bed-fellowship. After his death (in 1238,) by the~
inspiration of God, whom she besought in unceasing prayer, she clad herself for~
godliness' sake in the habit of a Cistercian nun in the monastery (which had~
been finished) at Trebnitz (in 1219.)  She continued absorbed in God. She~
remained engaged in the Divine Office and hearing Masses from sunrise till noon,~
and trod mightily under foot the old enemy of man.

[Lectio5]
She could not bear to hear talk of worldly things, unless they had to do with~
the things of God or the saving of souls. She was very wise in business, not~
doing too much, nor unseasonably, and withal courteous and gentle toward all~
men. She got a great victory over herself by maltreating her flesh with fasting,~
watching, and rough clothing. She was an ensample of the higher Christian graces~
and of a godly nun, by the wisdom of her counsels, and the straightforwardness~
and peacefulness of her mind. It was her use to rank herself after all others,~
and cheerfully to undertake lower offices than those of the other nuns. She~
ministered to the poor even upon her knees, and washed and kissed the feet of~
lepers, having such command over herself as not to recoil from their sores~
oozing with matter.

[Lectio6]
Her long-suffering and endurance were very marvellous, especially when her son~
Henry, Duke of Silesia, to whom she bore a mother's love, was killed by the~
Tartars (in 1241.) His death drew from her rather thanksgiving to God than tears~
for him. (She died upon the 15th day of October, in the year 1243.) She was~
famous for miracles. One while, being called on, she restored to life a boy who~
had fallen into the water, been dashed against the wheels of a mill, and wholly~
crushed. This and the like being duly proved, Clement IV. numbered her name~
among those of the Saints, and allowed her Feastday to be kept in Poland, in~
which country, being Patroness, she hath most honour, upon the 15th of October;~
which permission was given to the whole Church by Innocent XI. for the 17th day~
of the same month.

[Lectio94]
Hedwig was illustrious for her royal birth, being the maternal aunt of St Elisabeth, daughter of the King of Hungary. At the age of twelve she was given in marriage to Henry, duke of Poland, and brought up the children of their marriage in the fear of God. In order to devote herself more closely to the service of God, she persuaded her husband to agree to a vow of continence for both of them. Upon the death of her husband she took the Cistercian habit in the monastery of Trebnitz, where she was intent on contemplation and took her delight in continually assisting at Divine Office and at Mass. Adorned with the highest virtue, most severe penance, wise counsel and candor of soul, she became an example of highest religious perfection. She was accustomed to make herself subject to all and to undertake the most menial tasks, ministering to the poor on her knees, and washing and kissing the feet of lepers. Her wonderful patience and constancy of soul where shown especially at the death of Henry, the duke of Silesia, her son, who was killed in battle by the Tatars. She was famous for miracles, especially after her death, and was enrolled among the Saints by Clement IV.
