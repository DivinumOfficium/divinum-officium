From the Sermons of Pope St Leo (the Great.)
!First Sermon on the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul, before the middle.
When the twelve holy Apostles had received from the Holy Ghost the power to~
speak all languages, they divided the whole world into districts, which they~
severally allotted to themselves as fields for their Gospel labours. Then was~
Peter, the Prince of the Apostles, sent to the capital city of the Roman Empire,~
that he might cause the light to shine thence throughout the whole body of the~
civilized nations. At that time what nation was there that had no representative~
in Rome? When Rome had learnt, what people that did not learn too? In Rome were~
the dreams of an unbelieving philosophy to be destroyed, in Rome were the empty~
utterances of earthly wisdom to be confuted, in Rome was idolatry to be overcome,~
in Rome profanity to be put down, even in Rome, where the activity of~
superstition had gathered together from the whole earth every error which it~
could find.

[Lectio5]
O most blessed Apostle Peter! this was the city to which thou didst not shrink~
to come. The Apostle Paul, thy comrade in glory, was yet occupied in founding~
the Churches, and thou didst enter alone into that forest of wild beasts roaring~
furiously; thou didst commit thyself to that stormy ocean, more boldly than when~
thou walkest upon the waters to come to Jesus.

[Lectio6]
Thou hadst already taught them of the circumcision who were converted; thou~
hadst founded the Church of Antioch, the first that bore the noble name of~
Christian; thou hadst published the law of the Gospel throughout Pontus, Galatia,~
Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia; and thou didst not fear for the hardness of thy~
work, nor turn back because of thine old age, but didst boldly set up the trophy~
of the cross of Christ upon those Roman walls, where the Providence of God had~
appointed the throne of thine honour, and the glorious -scene of thy passion.

From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 16:13-19
In that time Jesus came into the quarters of Cesarea Philippi: and he asked his~
disciples, saying: Whom do men say that the Son of man is? And so on.
_
Homily by St Hilary, Bishop (of Poitiers.)
!Commentary on Matthew xvi.
The Lord asketh His disciples who men say that He is, and He addeth, He, the Son~
of Man. Let us ever remember to hold fast this truth of our profession, namely,~
that the Son of God is the Son of Man also. Were He one and not the other, then~
were He no Saviour for us. The Lord then, having heard the various opinions of~
men, asketh, But Who say ye that I am? And Simon Peter answered and said Thou~
art the Christ, the Son of the living God. Peter had weighed the questions. The~
Lord had asked, Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am? That He was Son of~
Man was sufficiently evident to all who looked upon His Body. But when He spake~
of His whole Self, and asked, Who do ye say that I am? He showed that the mind~
had something to grasp beyond That Which was seen, for Son of Man He was~
manifestly. What judgment did He wish them to give? I think it was not /that~
which He had owned concerning Himself. That something more, which He wished them~
to own, was a hidden thing, whereunto the faith of them that believed in Him was~
to reach.

[Lectio8]
Peters confession was followed by a proper reward for having seen the Son of God~
in the Son of Man. Blessed is this holy Apostle, in whose praise it is said that~
he saw with more than human eyes That Which was unseen, who gazed upon Flesh and~
Blood, and by the secret revelation of the Heavenly Father recognised the~
Eternal Son of God; who was the first thought worthy to acknowledge the Divinity~
of Christ. {Here, if necessary, the Lesson is divided.) God bless thee, O Peter,~
thou who by uttering for the first time the title of Divine honour, didst lay~
the goodly foundation of the Church! God bless thee, thou worthy rock whereon~
she is built, for ever triumphant over the infernal powers, the gates of hell,~
and the bands of death! God bless thee, happy door-keeper of heaven, to whose~
keeping are given the keys of the everlasting mansions, whose sentences on earth~
are already confirmed in heaven so that whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth~
shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be~
loosed in heaven.

[Lectio93]
!Commemoratio for St Prisca, Virgin and Martyr.
Prisca was a noble Roman maiden, who at thirteen years of age was accused of~
Christianity before the Emperor Claudius. By his command she was taken to the~
temple of Apollo to sacrifice there, and when she refused, was buffeted and sent~
to prison. She was taken out from thence again, but as she still held~
steadfastly to the faith, they flogged her, poured boiling tallow upon her, and~
sent her back a second time. She was at last thrown to a lion in the~
amphitheatre, but it quietly lay down at her feet. She was starved for three~
days in a slaves' prison house, and then tortured upon the rack. Pieces of flesh~
were next torn from her body with iron hooks, and she was thrown on a burning~
pile. She marvellously still remained alive, and was accordingly beheaded~
outside the city. Thus she added the crown of martyrdom to the palm of~
virginity. The Christians buried her body at the tenth milestone on the road~
from Rome to Ostia on the eighteenth of January.
