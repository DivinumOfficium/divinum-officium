[Hymnus Vespera]
O Christ, the world’s Creator bright,
Who didst mankind from sin redeem,
Light from the Father’s glorious Light,
True God of God, in bliss supreme.
_
thy love compelled thee to assume
A mortal body, man to save;
Reversing the old Adam’s doom;
Our ransom the New Adam gave.
_
That love which gloriously framed all
The earth, the stars, and wondrous sea
Took pity on our parents’ fall,
Broke all our bonds and set us free.
_
O Saviour, let thy potent love
Flow ever from thy bounteous Heart;
To nations that pure fount above
The grace of pardon will unpart.
_
His Heart for this was opened wide,
And wounded by the soldier’s spear,
That freely from His sacred side
Might flow the streams our souls to clear.
_
Glory to Father and to Son,
And to the Holy Ghost the same,
To whom all power, when time is done,
And endless rule, in endless fame.
Ámen.

[Versum 1]
V. I am come to send fire on the earth,
R. And what will I, if it be already kindled?

[Ant 1]
My heart hath looked for * reproach and bitterness and I looked for some to~
take pity on me, and there was none and for comforters, and I found none.

[Oratio 1]
O God, the Protector of all them that trust in thee, without Whom nothing is~
strong, nothing is Holy increase and multiply upon us thy mercy, that Thou~
being our ruler and guide, we may so pass through things temporal, that we~
finally lose not the things eternal.

[Invit]
Christ suffered for us, * O come, let us worship Him

[Hymnus Matutinum]
Lo, how the savage crew
Of our proud sins hath rent
The Heart of our all-gracious God,
That Heart so innocent.
_
The soldier’s quivering lance
Our guilt it was that drave,
Our wicked deeds that to its point
Such cruel sharpness gave.
_
O wounded Heart, whence sprang
The Church, the Saviour’s bride;
Thou Door of our Salvation’s Ark
Set in its mystic side.
_
Thou holy fouit, whence flows
The sacred sevenfold flood,
Where we our filthy robes may
cleanse
_
In the Lamb’s saving Blood:
By sorrowful relapse, thee will we rend no more;
But like the flames, those types of love,
Strive heavenward to soar.
_
Father and Son supreme
And Spirit, hear our cry;
Whose is the kingdom, praise and power,
Through all eternity.
Ámen.

De Isaia Propheta.
!Isa 12:1-6
1 Azon a napon így szólsz majd: Hálát adok neked, Uram, mert haragudtál ugyan~
rám, de lecsillapult haragod és megvigasztaltál.
2 Nézzétek: Isten az üdvösségem! Bizalom tölt el, s nincs bennem félelem, mert~
az Úr az erõsségem, a dicsõítõ énekem, és az üdvösségem.
3 Örömmel meríttek majd vizet az üdvösség forrásaiból.
4 Azon a napon így szóltok majd: Adjatok hálát az Úrnak, magasztaljátok nevét. A~
népek között hirdessétek tetteit, s mondjátok el, milyen fölséges a neve.

!Isa 26:1-6
1 Azon a napon ezt az éneket éneklik Júda földjén: Erõs várunk van, védelmül~
kõfal és bástya szolgál.
2 Nyissátok ki a kapukat! Hadd vonuljon be az igaz nemzet, amely mindvégig~
hûséges,
3 amelynek szíve állhatatos és megõrzi a békét, mert benned van bizalma.
4 Bízzatok az Úrban örökkön-örökké, mert az Úr örökké megmaradó Szikla!
5 Letaszította a magasban lakókat, és a büszke várost megalázta, és földig~
alázta, a porba sújtotta,
6 úgyhogy most láb tiporja, a szegények lába, a szûkölködõk talpa.

[Responsory2]

[Lectio4]
From the Sermons of St Bernard, Abbat of Clairvaux.
!3rd on the Lords Passion.
How that we have once reached the Heart of Jesus, that Heart of exceeding~
sweetness, and know how that "it is good for us to be here," (Matth. xvii. 4,)~
let us never again suffer ourselves to be torn away from Him concerning Whom it~
is written "They that depart from thee shall be written in the earth." (Jer.~
xvii. 13.) But what portion is theirs that draw nigh unto thee, Thou thyself, O~
Lord, dost tell us, for Thou hast said unto such " Rejoice, because your names~
are written in heaven." (Luke x. 20.) Unto thee therefore let us draw nigh "we~
will be glad and rejoice in thee " when " we remember thine" Heart. (Cant. i.~
3.) "Behold, how good and pleasant it is to dwell in" (Ps. cxxxii. 1) this~
Heart! Yea, let me cast away all things, all my thoughts, and all my feelings,~
let me cast them all away, and let me "cast all my care" (1 Pet. v. 7) upon the~
Heart of the Lord Jesus "and He shall sustain me." (Ps. liv. 23.)

[Responsory4]
R. He that eateth My Flesh and drinketh My Blood
* Dwelleth in Me, and I in him
V. What nation is there so great, who hath gods so nigh unto them, as the Lord~
our God is to us?
R. Dwelleth in Me, and I in him.

[Lectio5]
Toward this Temple, toward this Holy of Holies, towards this Ark of the covenant,~
"will I worship and praise thy Name " (Ps. cxxxvii. 2) saying with David " thy~
servant hath found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee " (2 Kings vii.~
27.) And I have found the Heart of Jesus, the Heart of my King, my Brother, and~
my tender Friend. And am I not to worship Yea, O Jesus most sweet, now that I~
have found this Heart, Which is both thine and mine, I will worship thee, O my~
God And, O, do Thou graciously let my supplication enter into that Sanctuary~
of mercy Draw me altogether into that Heart of thine O Jesus, in the~
Perfection of thy beauty fairer than the children of men, wash Thou me "~
thoroughly from mine iniquity and cleanse me from my sin," (Ps. 1. 4,) that,~
being made pure by thee, I may be able to come unto thee, Who art thyself most~
Pure, and that I may be meet " to dwell in thy " Heart " all the days of my life,~
to behold " (Ps. xxvi. 4) thee, and to be strong to do thy will.

[Responsory5]
R. He hath been brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and while he was~
evil-entreated he opened not his mouth he was delivered up to death
* That he might quicken his people
V. He hath poured out his soul unto death, and he was numbered with the~
transgressors.
R. That he might quicken his people.

[Lectio6]
To this end was thy Side pierced, that we might find a wide entrance there. To~
this end was thine Heart wounded, that we might be able to dwell in It and in~
thee, "hidden in the secret of thy presence from the troubling of men." (Ps.~
xxx. 21.) Nevertheless, It was pierced to this end also, that behind that Bodily~
Wound which we see, we may perceive that wound of love which is not bodily. And~
how could that love be more strikingly shown than it is by Him Who hath given,~
not His Body only, but His very Heart, to be pierced for us The bodily wound~
showeth the spiritual. Who is there that would not love that wounded Heart Who~
would not return love for love to Him That hath loved so well Who would not~
embrace Him Who standeth so pure While, therefore, we yet linger here in this~
body, let us love and love again Him Who hath first loved us, let us lay hold on~
that Wounded One, Wounded for us, Whose Hands and Feet, Whose Side and Heart,~
the wicked husbandmen have so pierced. (Matth. xxi. 35-39.) Let us stand waiting~
till He be pleased to constrain with the bond, and pierce with the spear, of His~
love, these hearts of ours that still are so hard and unrepentant. (So far St~
Bernard.) The Supreme Pontiff Clement XIII., to the end that Christ's faithful~
people might in still more godly and earnest sort call to mind, and more readily~
drink in the fruits of, the wondrous love of Him Who suffered for us, Who laid~
down His life for the redemption of man, and who hath instituted the Sacrament~
of His Own Body and Blood for a continual showing-forth of His death, of which~
love His Most Sacred Heart is an embodiment, granted the prayer of certain~
Churches, which desired to observe a Festival in honour of the said Most Sacred~
Heart. This Feast Pius IX. extended to the whole Church, and at length the~
Supreme Pontiff, Leo XIII., in accordance with the wishes of the whole Catholic~
world, raised it to the rank of a Double of the First Class.

[Responsory6]
R. Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised
* And His Wisdom is unsearchable. '
V. Great is our Lord, and of great power, and His understanding is infinite.
R. And His Wisdom is unsearchable.
&Gloria
R. And His Wisdom is unsearchable.

[Lectio7]
From the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 19:31-17
31 Az elõkészület napja volt. A zsidók arra kérték Pilátust, töresse meg a~
keresztre feszítettek lábszárát és vetesse le õket a keresztrõl.  És így tovább
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop of Hippo
!12 oth Tract on John.
"One of the soldiers with a spear pierced His Side, and forthwith came thereout~
Blood and Water." The Evangelist speaketh carefully. He saith not that He smote~
the Side, nor yet that he wounded It, nor yet anything else, but "pierced"~
"pierced" It, to fling wide the entrance unto life, whence flow the Sacraments~
of the Church, those Sacraments without which there is no entrance unto the life~
which is life indeed. That Blood Which was shed there was shed for the remission~
of sins, that Water is the water that mantleth in the cup of salvation. Therein~
are we washed and thereof do we drink. Of this was it a type when it was said~
unto Noah: "The door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof.. and of~
every living thing of all flesh shalt thou bring into the ark.. to keep them~
alive." (Gen. vi. 16, 19.) A figure this of the Church.

[Responsory7]
R. As the living Father hath sent Me, and I live by the Father
* So he that eateth Me, even he shall live by Me.
V. With the bread of life and understanding hath the Lord fed him.
R. So he that eateth Me, even he shall live by Me.

[Lectio8]
From the Homilies of St John Chrysostom, Patriarch of Constantinople.
!84th on John.
Seest thou the power of the truth? The act of the Jews was a mean to the~
fulfilment of prophecy, whereby another truth was made manifest. " Then came the~
soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other, which was crucified~
with Him. But when they came to Jesus, and saw that He was dead already, they~
brake not His Legs but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced His Side."~
Willing to do the Jews a pleasure, that man outraged his Redeemer even in death~
vile and iniquitous willingness But rest Thou still, O Thou Whom my soul~
loveth they thought to do it wickedly, but they did service to the truth. "~
For these things were done that the Scripture should be fulfilled: 'A bone of~
Him shall not be broken ' and again another Scripture saith 'They shall look~
on Him Whom they pierced.'" Nor was it done for this alone, but it was afterward a~
mean to faith for Thomas and them that were with him. And yet again another~
great mystery was here established, for " forthwith came thereout Blood and~
Water." Nor idly nor perchance sprang forth that twofold fountain, for the~
Church, like her Great Head, " came by Water and Blood not by Water only, but by~
Water and Blood." (1 John v. 6.)

[Responsory8]
R. Our Shepherd, even the Fountain of living waters, is gone from us He passed~
away, and the sun was darkened.
* Our Saviour hath burst the gates and bars of death.
V. The bands of hell He hath utterly abolished, and hath done away the power of~
the devil.
R. Our Saviour hath burst the gates and bars of death.
&Gloria
R. Our Saviour hath burst the gates and bars of death.

!De Homilia sancti Bonaventurae Episcopi.
!Liber de ligno Vitae.
Porro ut de latere Christi dormientis formaretur Ecclesia, divina est~

perfoderet, quatenus sanguine cum aqua manente pretium effunderetur nostrae~

[Hymnus Laudes]
Jesus, behind thy Temple’s veil,
Hid in an ark of gold,
On stones engraven, lay the
Law thy finger wrote of old.
_
But in thy Body’s temple new,
thy life-blood’s throbbing shrine,
Held, upon fleshly tables graved,
The law of Love Divine.
_
And when that Heart in death was stilled,
Each temple’s veil was riven:
And lo, within thy Love’s red shrine,
To us to look was given.
_
There make us gaze and see the love
Which drew thee, for our sake,
O great High-priest, thyself to God
A sacrifice to make.
_
Thou, Saviour, cause that every soul
Which Thou hast loved so well,
May will within thine open Heart
In life and death to dwell.
_
Grant it, O Father, only Son,
And Spirit, God of grace,
To whom all worship shall be done,
In every time and place.
Ámen.
