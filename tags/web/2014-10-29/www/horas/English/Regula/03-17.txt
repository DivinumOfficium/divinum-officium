03-17# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 38: Concerning the Weekly Reader
_
Reading ought not to be wanting to the brethren when they eat at table: and let not anyone presume to read there because he happens to have casually picked up the book, but let one who is to read for the whole week enter upon his office on the Lord’s day: and when he enters upon his office let him, after the Mass and Communion, beg of all prayers for himself that God avert from him the spirit of pride: and let this versicle be said in the oratory thrice by all, he himself however beginning it: “Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord; and my mouth shall shew forth Thy praise”; and so having received his blessing let him enter upon his office of reading: and let complete silence be kept so that the whispering of none be heard there, nor the voice of any but of him only who is reading: and let the brethren who are eating and drinking pass each other such things as they require so that no one may have to ask for anything; but if it should be necessary, it were better to make request by means of some sound-signal rather than by word of mouth: and let not anyone presume to ask any question there whether about the reading or otherwise, that occasion be not given for talking, unless by chance the superior wish to say anything briefly for the purpose of edification.

And let the brother who is weekly reader receive a “mixtum” before he begins to read, both because of the Holy Communion and also lest by chance it be too great strain upon him to keep his fast; and afterwards let him take his meal with the weekly kitcheners and the servitor. And let not all the brethren read or sing in order, but only those who may edify their hearers.
