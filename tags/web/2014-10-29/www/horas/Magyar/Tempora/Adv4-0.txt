Olvasmány Izaiás próféta könyvébõl
!Isa 35:1-7
1 Örüljön a puszta és a kiaszott vidék, ujjongjon a sivatag és viruljon!
2 Virulva viruljon, mint a liliom, és örömében ujjongva daloljon! Mert övé a~
Libanon dicsõsége, a Kármel és a Sáron pompája; meglátják az Úr dicsõségét,~
Istenünk ragyogó fönségét.
3 Erõsítsétek meg az elernyedt kezeket, és a roskadozó térdeket szilárdítsátok~
meg!
4 Mondjátok a csüggedt szívûeknek: "Bátorság! Ne féljetek! Nézzétek, eljön~
Istenetek, eljön, hogy bosszút álljon és megfizessen. Maga az Isten jön el, hogy~
szabadulást hozzon nektek."
5 Akkor megnyílik a vakok szeme, s a süketek füle hallani fog.
6 Ugrándozik majd a sánta, mint a szarvas, és a némák nyelve ujjongva ujjong.~
Mert vizek fakadnak a pusztában, folyóvizek a sivatagban.
7 A száraz vidék tóvá változik, a szomjas föld vizek forrásává. 

[Responsory1]
R. Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, call together the nations, tell it out among the~
people, and say
* Behold, God our Saviour cometh.
V. Tell it out and make it to be heard; speak aloud and cry
R. Behold, God our Saviour cometh.

[Lectio2]
!Isa 35:7-10
7 A sakálok egykori lakóhelyén zöldellõ fû és nád terem..
8 És egy tiszta út vezet majd át rajta, úgy fogják hívni: a szentek útja.~
Tisztátalan nem léphet rá, sem a balgák nem bolyongnak rajta.
9 Nem lesz ott oroszlán, más ragadozó sem jár arra; a megváltottak vándorolnak~
rajta,
10 akiknek az Úr szabadulást szerzett, azok térnek vissza rajta. Éneket zengve~
érnek a Sionra, s örök boldogságot tükröz az arcuk. Öröm és ujjongás jár a~
nyomukban, mert fájdalom és siralom nem lesz többé.

[Responsory2]
R. The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor the law-giver from his loins,~
until he that shall be sent cometh.
* And unto him shall the longing of the Gentiles be.
V. His eyes shall be bright with wine, and his teeth white with milk.
R. And unto him shall the desire of the Gentiles be.

[Lectio3]
!Isa 41:1-4
1 Hallgassatok rám, ti szigetek; kapjanak új erõre a nemzetek, lépjenek elé és~
beszéljenek, szálljunk egymással perbe!
2 "Ki támasztotta kelet felõl azt, akit minden lépésében gyõzelem kísér? Ki az,~
aki a nemzeteket kiszolgáltatja neki, és megalázza elõtte a királyokat? Kardja~
porrá zúzza õket, íja meg szétszórja, mint a pelyvát.
3 Üldözõbe veszi õket, s akadálytalanul halad elõre, lába szinte nem is éri az~
utat.
4 Ki határozta el, s ki vitte ezt végbe? Az, aki kezdettõl fogva szólította a~
nemzeteket. Én, az Úr, az elsõ, aki még az utolsók közt is ugyanaz vagyok."

[Responsory3]
R. I must decrease, but He must increase He it is Who, coming after me is~
preferred before me
* Whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.
V. I baptize you with water; but He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.
R. Whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.
&Gloria
R. Whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.

[Lectio4]
From the Sermons of Pope St Leo (the Great,)
!1st on the December Fast, and almsgiving.
Dearly beloved brethren, if we study attentively the history of the creation of~
our race, we shall find that man was made in the image of God, that his ways~
also might be an imitation of the ways of his Maker. This is the natural, real,~
and highest dignity to which we are capable of attaining, that the goodness of~
the Divine nature should have a reflection in us, as in a glass. As a mean of~
reaching this dignity, we are daily offered the grace of our Saviour, for as in~
the first Adam all men are fallen, so in the Second Adam can all men be raised~
up again (i Cor. xv. 22).

[Responsory4]
R. Unto us shall a Child be born, and His name shall be called the Mighty God.
* He shall sit upon the throne of His father David, and shall reign, and the~
government shall be upon His shoulder.
V. In Him shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed; all nations shall~
serve Him.
R. He shall sit upon the throne of His father David, and shall reign, and the~
government shall be upon His shoulder.

[Lectio5]
Our restoration from the consequences of Adam's fall is sheer mercy of God, and~
nothing else; we should not have loved Him unless He had first loved us, (1 John~
iv. 19,) and scattered the darkness of our ignorance by the light of His truth.~
This the Lord promised by the mouth of Isaiah, where He saith, (Isa. xlii. 16,) I~
will bring the blind by a way that they knew not, and I will lead them in paths~
that they have not known I will make darkness light before them, and crooked~
things straight. These things will I do unto them and not forsake them. And~
again, (Isa. lxv. 1, 2; Rom. x. 20,) I was found of them that sought Me not; I~
was made manifest unto them that asked not after Me.

[Responsory5]
R. Behold, the fulness of the time is come, wherein God hath sent forth His Son~
into the world, born of a Virgin, made under the law
* To redeem them that were under the law.
V. God, for His great love wherewith He loved us, hath sent His own Son in~
the likeness of sinful flesh.
R. To redeem them that were under the law.

[Lectio6]
And we know from the Apostle John how God fulfilled His promise, (1 John v. 20.)~
We know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we~
may know Him That is True, and be in Him That is True, even in His Son. And~
again, (iv. 19,) Let us therefore love God, because He first loved us. For His~
great love then wherewith he hath loved us, (Eph. ii. 4,) God reneweth His~
likeness in us. And, moreover, in order that He may find in us the reflection of~
His goodness, He giveth us that whereby to work along with Himself, (Who worketh~
all in all,) lighting, as it were, candles in our dark minds, and kindling in us~
the fire of His love, to make us love not Himself only, but likewise, in Him,~
whatsoever He loveth.

[Responsory6]
R. O virgin of Israel, turn again to thy cities.
* How long wilt thou go about sorrowing? Thou shalt bring forth the Lord thy~
Saviour, a new offering in the earth; men shall walk in paths of salvation.
V. I have loved thee with an everlasting love therefore with lovingkindness~
have I drawn thee.
R. How long wilt thou go about sorrowing? Thou shalt bring forth the Lord thy~
Saviour, a new offering in the earth.
&Gloria
R. Men shall walk in paths of salvation.

Evangélium szent Lukács Evangélista kõnyvébõl
!Luke 3:1-6
Tiberius császár uralkodásának 15. esztendejében, amikor Poncius Pilátus volt~
Júdea helytartója És így tovább.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great,)
!20th on the Gospels.
John said unto the multitude, that came forth to be baptised of him O~
generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? The~
wrath to come in one sense signifieth the great vengeance of the Latter Day~
the sinner that repenteth not of his sin now, will have no mean whereby to flee~
from punishment then. Let us remark that addressing evil children copying the~
example of evil parents, the Baptist calleth them a generation of vipers in~
that they were envious at the righteous, and persecuted them; that they repaid~
evil for evil; that they hunted out ways of harming their neighbours, in all~
these things following the pattern of carnal parents, the prophet likeneth them~
to a venomous brood hatched from a venomous stock.

[Responsory7]
R. I have sworn, saith the Lord, that I will not be wroth any more with the~
earth; for the mountains and the hills shall receive My righteousness.
* And the covenant of My peace shall be in Jerusalem.
V. My salvation is near to come, and My righteousness to be revealed.
R. And the covenant of My peace shall be in Jerusalem.

[Lectio8]
We also have sinned, we have fallen into wicked habits. What must we do, if we~
would flee from the wrath to come? Let us hear John. Bring forth fruits worthy~
of repentance. In which words let us remark that the Friend of the Bridegroom~
demandeth not only fruits of repentance, but fruits worthy of repentance. The~
former are one thing, and the latter another. In considering then what are~
fruits worthy of repentance, we may remark that if we had done nothing unlawful~
we might have had free use of things which are lawful, and been able to sanctify~
ourselves without abstaining from indulgence in the things of the world.

[Responsory8]
R. We will not go back from thee. Thou, O Lord, shalt quicken us, and we will~
call upon thy name.
* Cause thy face to shine upon us, and we shall be saved.
V. Remember us, O Lord, with the favour that Thou showest unto thy people; O~
visit us with thy salvation.
R. Cause thy face to shine upon us, and we shall be saved.

[Lectio9]
But if any one, for example, hath fallen into fornication, or perhaps, into what~
is much worse, adultery, he ought to make up for his lawless pleasure by~
abstaining in some degree from lawful enjoyments. He that hath sinned less is~
not bound to mortify himself as much as he that hath sinned more, nor he that is~
innocent like him that is guilty. Let every one hearing these words bring forth~
fruits worthy of repentance, proceed to judge himself by his own conscience, and~
the more he perceiveth that he hath sinned, the greater penance let him do.

[Responsory9]
R. Consider how great this man is, who is entered in for the salvation of the~
nations; he is King of Righteousness
* Without descent, nor end of life.
V. The Fore-runner is for us entered, made an High Priest for ever after the~
order of Melchisedek.
R. Without descent, nor end of life.
&Gloria
R. Without descent, nor end of life.
