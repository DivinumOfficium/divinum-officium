!Song 5:8-12
8 I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my beloved, that you tell~
him that I languish with love.
9 What manner of one is thy beloved of the beloved, O thou most beautiful among~
women? what manner of one is thy beloved of the beloved, that thou hast so~
adjured us?
10 My beloved is white and ruddy, chosen out of thousands.
11 His head is as the finest gold: his locks as branches of palm trees, black as a~
raven.
12 His eyes as doves upon brooks of waters, which are washed with milk, and sit~
beside the plentiful streams.

!Song 6:1-5
1 My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the bed of aromatical spices, to~
feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
2 I to my beloved, and my beloved to me, who feedeth among the lilies.
3 Thou art beautiful, O my love, sweet and comely as Jerusalem: terrible as an~
army set in array.
4 Turn away thy eyes from me, for they have made me flee away. thy hair is as a~
flock of goats, that appear from Galaad.
5 thy teeth as a flock of sheep, which come up from the washing, all with twins,~
and there is none barren among them.

!Song 6:8-12
8 One is my dove, my perfect one is but one, she is the only one of her mother,~
the chosen of her that bore her. The daughters saw her, and declared her most~
blessed: the queens and concubines, and they praised her.
9 Who is she that cometh forth as the morning rising, fair as the moon, bright~
as the sun, terrible as an army set in array?
10 I went down into the garden of nuts, to see the fruits of the valleys, and to~
look if the vineyard had flourished, and the pomegranates budded.
11 I knew not: my soul troubled me for the chariots of Aminadab.
12 Return, return, O Sulamitess: return, return that we may behold thee.

De Sermone sancti Joannis Damasceni.
!Orat. 2. de Dormitione Deiparae, sub finem.
Ex antiqua accepimus traditione, quod tempore gloriosae dormitionis beatae~
Virginis, universi quidem sancti Apostoli, qui orbem terrae ad salutem Gentium~
peragrabant, momento tomporis in sublime elati, convenerunt Jerosolymis: cumque~
illic essent, eis visio apparuit angelica, et audita est psalmodia coelestium~
Potestatum; et sic cum divina gloria in manus Dei sanctam tradidit animam. Ejus~
autem corpus, quod Deum ineffabili quadam ratione suscepit, cura angelica et~
apostolica hymnodia elatum, in loculo fuit depositum Gethsemane: quo in loco~
Angelorum cantus mansit tres dies continuos.

Post tres autem dies angelico cantu cessante, qui aderant Apostoli cum unus~
Thomas, qui abfuerat, post tertiura diera venisset, et quod Deum susceperat,~
corpus adorare voluisset, tumulum aperuerunt; sed orani ex parte sacrum ejus~
corpus nequaquam invenire potuerunt. Cum ea autem tantum invenissent, in~
quibus fuerat compositura, et ineffabili, qui ex iis proficiscebatur, essent~
odore repleti, loculum clauserunt. Ejus mysterii obstupefacti miraculo hoc~
solum cogitare potuerunt, quod cui placuit ex Maria Virgine carnem suniere, et~
hominera fieri et nasci, cura esset Deus Verbum, et Dominus gloriae: quique post~
partura incoruptam servavit ejus virginitatem, eidem etiam placuit et ipsius,~
postquara migravit, iramaculatum corpus, incorruptum servatum, translatione~
honorare ante communem et universalem resurrectionem.

Aderant tunc cum Apostolis sanctissimus Timotheus, primus episcopus Ephesiorum,~
et Dionysius Areopagita, sicut ipse testatur in iis, quae de beato Hierotheo,~
qui ipse quoque tunc aderat, scripsit ad praedictum Timotheum, sic dicens: Nam~
etiam apud ipsos a Deo afflatos sacrorum antistites, quando nos quoque, ut nosti,~
et multi ex sanctis nostris fratribus, ad contuendum corpus, quod vitae~
principium dedit, et Deum suscepit, convenissemus (aderat autem et Domini frater~
Jacobus, et Petrus, suprema et antiquissima theologdrum summitas): et viso sacro~
corpore, placuit omnibus, prout quisque poterat, hymnis celebrare infinitam~
bonitatem divinae potentiae.

From the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 10:38-42 
At that time Jesus~
entered into a certain village, and a woman named Martha received Him into her~
house. And so on.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!27th on the Words of the Lord.
The troubling about many things passeth away, but the love for the one thing~
remaineth. Therefore that which Mary hath chosen shall not But that which thou~
hast chosen, O Martha, it must needs follow, it must needs be understood, shall~
be taken away from thee. But it will be taken away from thee for thy good, that~
that which is better may be given unto thee. Work will be taken away from thee~
that thou mayest rest. Thou art on the voyage Mary is already in port.

[Lectio8]
Ye see then, my dearly beloved brethren, and, as I think, ye now understand that~
in these two women, who were both well-pleasing in the sight of the Lord, both~
lovely, both disciples, ye see, I say, and whosoever ye be that understand, ye~
understand something great, which ye also that do not understand ought to hear~
and know, that in these two women there were figured two lives, that which now~
is, and that which is to come, the toilful and the restful, the sorrowing and~
the blessed, the temporal and the eternal.

[Responsory8]
@Sancti/08-15:Responsory8

[Lectio9]
There are two lives. Think more about them. Whatsoever this present life hath, I~
say not of evil, not of wickedness, not of crime, not of uncleanness, not of~
ungodliness, but toilsome and full of troubles, chastened by fears, and tried by~
temptations, so, I say, is even the guileless life which Martha must have. Look~
into this, then, as well as ye can, and, as I have said, think more about it~
than I speak. There was no wrong life in that house, either in the case of~
Martha, or in the case of Mary, and if ever there had been, it fled away when~
the Lord came in.
