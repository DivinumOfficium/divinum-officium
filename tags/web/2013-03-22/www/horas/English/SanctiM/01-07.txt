From the letter of blessed Apostle Paul to the Romans
!Rom 9:1-5
1 I speak the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing me witness in~
the Holy Ghost:
2 That I have great sadness, and continual sorrow in my heart.
3 For I wished myself to be an anathema from Christ, for my brethren, who are my~
kinsmen according to the flesh,
4 Who are Israelites, to whom belongeth the adoption as of children, and the~
glory, and the testament, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and~
the promises:
5 Whose are the fathers, and of whom is Christ, according to the flesh, who is~
over all things, God blessed for ever. Amen.

!Rom 9:6-10
6 Not as though the word of God hath miscarried. For all are not Israelites that~
are of Israel:
7 Neither are all they that are the seed of Abraham, children; but in Isaac~
shall thy seed be called:
8 That is to say, not they that are the children of the flesh, are the children~
of God; but they, that are the children of the promise, are accounted for the~
seed.
9 For this is the word of promise: According to this time will I come; and Sara~
shall have a son.
10 And not only she. But when Rebecca also had conceived at once, of Isaac our~
father.

!Rom 9:11-16
11 For when the children were not yet born, nor had done any good or evil that~
the purpose of God, according to election, might stand,
12 Not of works, but of him that calleth, it was said to her: The elder shall~
serve the younger.
13 As it is written: Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated.
14 What shall we say then? Is there injustice with God? God forbid.
15 For he saith to Moses: I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy; and I~
will shew mercy to whom I will shew mercy.
16 So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God~
that sheweth mercy.
