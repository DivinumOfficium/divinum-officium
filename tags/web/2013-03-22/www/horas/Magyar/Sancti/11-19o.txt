!Commemoration S. Pontianae Pope and Martyr
Pontian was a Roman, who ruled the Church in the reign of the Emperor Alexander.~
This Emperor banished him into the Island of Sardinia, along with the Priest~
Hippolytus, on account of their profession of the Christian faith. There he.~
endured many hardships because of his belief in Christ, and departed this life~
upon the 19th day of November, (in the year of our Lord 235.) His body was~
brought to Rome by Pope Fabian and his clergy, and buried in the cemetery of~
Kallistus, upon the Appian Way. He sat in the seat of Peter four years, four~
months, and twentyfive days. He held two Ordinations in the month of December,~
wherein he made six Priests, five Deacons, and six Bishops for divers places. At~
Lauds a Commemoration is made of the holy Martyr.
