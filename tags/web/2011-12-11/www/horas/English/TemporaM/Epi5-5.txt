[Lectio1]
From the letter of St Paul to Titus
!Titus 2:15;3:1-2
15 These things speak, and exhort and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.
1 Admonish them to be subject to princes and powers, to obey at a word, to be ready to every good work.
2 To speak evil of no man, not to be litigious, but gentle: shewing all mildness towards all men.

[Lectio2]
!Titus 3:3-7
3 For we ourselves also were some time unwise, incredulous, erring, slaves to divers desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.
4 But when the goodness and kindness of God our Savior appeared:
5 Not by the works of justice, which we have done, but according to his mercy, he saved us, by the laver of regeneration, and renovation of the Holy Ghost;
6 Whom he hath poured forth upon us abundantly, through Jesus Christ our Savior:
7 That, being justified by his grace, we may be heirs, according to hope of life everlasting.

[Lectio3]
!Titus 3:8-11
8 It is a faithful saying: and these things I will have thee affirm constantly: that they, who believe in God, may be careful to excel in good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.
9 But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law. For they are unprofitable and vain.
10 A man that is a heretic, after the first and second admonition, avoid:
11 Knowing that he, that is such an one, is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned by his own judgment.
