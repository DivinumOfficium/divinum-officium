[Versum 1]
V. Let the evening prayer ascend unto thee, O Lord.
R. And let there descend upon us thy mercy.

[Ant 1]
God hath received * Israel his servant: as he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed for ever.

[Oratio]
O God, Who knowest us to be set in the midst of so many and great dangers, that,~
by reason of the frailty of our nature, we cannot always stand upright; grant to~
us such health of mind and body, that by thy strength and protection we may~
overcome all evils, whereby for our sins we are justly afflicted.

Here begins the letter of St Paul to the Philippians
!Phil 1:1-7
1 Paul and Timothy, the servants of Jesus Christ; to all the saints in Christ~
Jesus, who are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons.
2 Grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus~
Christ.
3 I give thanks to my God in every remembrance of you,
4 Always in all my prayers making supplication for you all, with joy;
5 For your communication in the gospel of Christ from the first day until now.
6 Being confident of this very thing, that he, who hath begun a good work in you,~
will perfect it unto the day of Christ Jesus.
7 As it is meet for me to think this for you all, for that I have you in my~
heart; and that in my bands, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel,~
you all are partakers of my joy.

!Phil 1:8-14
8 For God is my witness, how I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.
9 And this I pray, that your charity may more and more abound in knowledge, and~
in all understanding:
10 That you may approve the better things, that you may be sincere and without~
offence unto the day of Christ,
11 Filled with the fruit of justice, through Jesus Christ, unto the glory and~
praise of God.
12 Now, brethren, I desire you should know, that the things which have happened~
to me, have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the gospel:
13 So that my bands are made manifest in Christ, in all the court, and in all~
other places;
14 And many of the brethren in the Lord, growing confident by my bands, are much~
more bold to speak the word of God without fear.

!Phil 1:15-18
15 Some indeed, even out of envy and contention; but some also for good will~
preach Christ.
16 Some out of charity, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.
17 And some out of contention preach Christ not sincerely: supposing that they~
raise affliction to my bands.
18 But what then? So that by all means, whether by occasion, or by truth, Christ~
be preached: in this also I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.

[Lectio4]
From the Book of Moral (Reflections on Job) written by Pope St Gregory (the~
Great.)
!iv. 30.
We refresh the body lest it should grow too weak and fail us; we chasten it by~
abstinence, lest it should wax gross, and become lord over us; we strengthen it~
with exercise, lest it perish by the not using; and straightway we give it rest,~
lest it faint through weariness; we succour it with raiment, lest the cold~
should blight it; and we strip it of the raiment wherewith we have clothed it,~
lest the heat should afflict it. In all these so many offices what do we but~
serve the corruptible? Upon what is all this care spent but upon that wherover~
hangeth the doom of weakness and change?

[Lectio5]
Therefore saith Paul tells: For the creature was made subject to vanity, not~
willingly, but by reason of Him Who hath subjected the same in hope because~
the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into~
the glorious liberty of the children of God. (Rom. viii. 20.) The creature was~
made subject to vanity, not willingly  for when man had of his own free will~
abdicated his state of unchangeable blessedness, the just sentence of death was~
passed upon him, and whether he willed or not, he became subject to the state of~
change and corruption. But the creature itself also shall be delivered from the~
bondage of corruption when it shall rise again incorruptible and be made~
partaker of the glory of the children of God.

[Lectio6]
Where, then, the elect are still subject to sorrow, being yet bound by the~
sentence of corruption; but when we shall have put off this corruptible we shall~
be loosed from that sentence, and shall sorrow no more. For though we earnestly~
desire to appear before God, we are still hindered by the burden of this dying~
body. Rightly then are we called prisoners, since we are not free to go whither~
we will, that is to say, to God; and rightly did the prisoner Paul, yearning~
after the things which are eternal, and still weighed down with the burden of~
this corruptible, rightly did he cry out I have a desire to depart and to be~
with Christ. (Phil. i. 23.) He would not have felt this keenness if he had not~
felt himself bound down.

From the holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 8:23-27
In that time when Jesus entered into the boat, his disciples followed him: And~
behold a great tempest arose in the sea, so that the boat was covered with waves,~
but he was asleep. And so on.
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Bk. i. Comm. on Matth. viii.
The fifth sign that He did was when He took ship at Capernaum, and commanded the~
winds and the sea the sixth, when, in the country of the Gergesenes, He~
suffered the devils to enter into the swine the seventh, when, as He came into~
His own city, He cured the man sick of the palsy lying on a bed. The first man~
sick of the palsy that He cured was the centurion's servant.

[Lectio8]
But He was asleep; and His disciples came to Him, and awoke Him, saying Lord,~
save us. There is a type of this in the history of Jonah, who, when the storm~
arose, was lying fast asleep, and whom the sailors woke to help them; who also~
saved the sailors by commanding them to throw him into the sea, the said casting~
of him into the sea, being, as we know, a figure of Christ's Passion. Then He~
arose and rebuked the winds and the sea. From these words we understand that all~
things, which have been made, are sentient to their Maker. All things which He~
rebuketh or commandeth, hear His voice. This is not the error of the heretics~
who will have it that everything is quick, but part of the majesty of the~
Creator, Who maketh to feel Him things which we cannot make to feel us.

[Lectio9]
But the men marvelled, saying What manner of man is this, that even the winds~
and the sea obey Him? It was not His disciples that marvelled, but the sailors,~
and the others that were in the ship. tf r however, any one willeth to withstand~
this our interpretation and to maintain that it was the disciples who marvelled,~
we are ready to answer them that they who knew not before the power of the~
Saviour deserve to be stripped of the title of disciples, and to be called~
simply the men.

[Versum 2]
V. The Lord reigneth He is clothed with majesty.
R. The Lord is clothed with strength, and has girded Himself with power.

[Ant 2]
When Jesus was entered into a ship, * there arose a great tempest in the sea~
and His disciples awoke Him, saying Lord, Save us we perish.

[Ant 3]
Lord, Save us * we perish give the word, O God, and let there be a great~
calm!

[LectioE]
v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 8:23-27
8:23 And when he entered into the boat, his disciples followed him:
8:24 And behold a great tempest arose in the sea, so that the boat was covered with waves, but he was asleep.
8:25 And they came to him, and awaked him, saying: Lord, save us, we perish.
8:26 And Jesus saith to them: Why are you fearful, O ye of little faith? Then rising up he commanded the winds, and the sea, and there came a great calm.
8:27 But the men wondered, saying: What manner of man is this, for the winds and the sea obey him?
