04-29# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 71: That the Brethren Be Obedient Among Themselves
_
The excellence of obedience is not only to be shown by all towards the abbot, but likewise let the brethren also be obedient among themselves, bearing in mind that by this way of obedience they will be journeying Godwards.

Any command from the abbot therefore, or from the provosts who are appointed by him—to which we do not permit private commands to be preferred—having been put first, for the rest let all juniors be obedient to their seniors with most vigilant charity. But if anyone be found contentious, let him be corrected. And if any brother is corrected, it matters not in what way, by the abbot or by any other of those senior to him, or if he shall at all perceive that any senior’s mind is angered or moved against him, however slightly, at once without delay having prostrated on the ground let him lie at his feet, thus making satisfaction until that feeling be healed by giving of benediction. But if anyone should disdain to do so, either let him be subjected to corporal punishment, or else if he be contumacious let him be expelled from the monastery.
