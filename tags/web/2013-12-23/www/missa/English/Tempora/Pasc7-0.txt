Lesson from the Acts of Apostles
!Acts 2:1-11.
When the days of Pentecost were drawing to a close, they were all together in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a violent wind blowing, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. And there appeared to them parted tongues as of fire, which settled upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy spirit and began to speak in foreign tongues, even as the Holy Spirit prompted them to speak. Now there were staying at Jerusalem, devout Jews, from every nation under heaven. And when this sound was heard, the multitude gathered and were bewildered in mind, because each heard them speaking in his own language. But they were all amazed and marvelled saying, Behold, are not all these that are speaking Galileans? And how have we heard each his own language in which he was born? Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and inhabitants of Mesopotamia, Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphilia, Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, Jews also and proselytes, Cretens and Arabians, we have heard them speaking in our own languages of the wonderful works of God.

[Graduale]
Alleluia, alleluia.
!Ps. 103:30
V. Send forth Your Spirit, and they shall be created: and You shall renew the~
face of the earth. Alleluia. (Kneel.)
V. Come, O Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of Your faithful: and kindle in them the~
fire of Your love.

[Sequentia]
Holy Spirit! Lord of light!
From Thy clear celestial height,
Thy pure, beaming radiance give:
_
Come, Thou, Father of the poor!
Come, with treasures which endure!
Come, Thou light of all that live!
_
Thou of all consolers best,
Visiting the troubled breast,
Dost refreshing peace bestow:
_
Thou in toil art comfort sweet;
Pleasant coolness in the heat;
Solace in the midst of woe.
_
Light immortal! Light divine!
Visit Thou these hearts of Thine,
And our inmost being fill.
_
If Thou take Thy grace away,
Nothing pure in man will stay;
All his good is turn’d to ill.
_
Heal our wounds - our strength renew;
On our dryness pour Thy dew;
Wash the stains of guilt away:
_
Bend the stubborn heart and will;
Melt the frozen, warm the chill;
Guide the steps that go astray.
_
Thou, on those who evermore
Thee confess and Thee adore,
In Thy sevenfold gifts descend.
_
Give them comfort when they die;
Give them life with Thee on high;
Give them joys which never end.
Amen. Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 14:23-31.
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples: If anyone love Me, he will keep My~
word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our abode~
with him. He who does not love Me, does not keep My words. And the word that you~
have heard is not Mine, but the Father’s Who sent Me. These things I have spoken~
to you while yet dwelling with you. But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, Whom the~
Father will send in My Name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your~
mind whatever I have said to you. Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you;~
not as the world gives do I give to you. Do not let your heart be troubled, or~
be afraid. You have heard Me say to you, ‘I go away and I am coming to you.’ If~
you loved Me, you would indeed rejoice that I am going to the Father, for the~
Father is greater than I. And now I have told you before it comes to pass, that~
when it has come to pass you may believe. I will no longer speak much with you,~
for the prince of the world is coming an in Me he has nothing. But he comes that~
the world may know that I love the Father, and that I do as the Father has~
commanded Me.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 67:2-3
Confirm, O God, what You have wrought in us; from Your temple, which is in~
Jerusalem, kings shall offer gifts to You. Alleluia.

[Secreta]
Sanctify these offerings, we beseech You, O Lord, and cleanse our hearts by the~
light of the Holy Spirit.

Suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a violent wind blowing, where~

[Postcommunio]
May the inpouring of the Holy Spirit cleanse our hearts, O Lord, and make them~
