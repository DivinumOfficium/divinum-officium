[Lectio93]
!Commemoratio for SS. Gordian and Epimachus. )
Gordian was a judge before whom, in the reign of Julian the Apostate,~
Januarius the Priest was brought to be condemned. Januarius instructed Gordian~
in the Christian faith, and himself, with his wife, and fifty-three other~
persons of the same household, were all baptized at Rome. On this account the~
Praetor sent back Januarius, and ordered Clementian the Deputy to cast Gordian~
into prison. Afterward he caused the same Gordian to be brought before him in~
chains, and when he found he could not shake him in his will to cleave to the~
faith, he commanded that he should first be hided with whips loaded with lead,~
and thereafter beheaded. His body was thrown out before the temple of Apollo for~
dogs to eat, but the Christians buried it at night in the catacombs upon the~
Latin Way, in the same vault where were already lying the remains of the blessed~
Martyr Epimachus. These had been brought from Alexandria, in which city~
Epimachus had long been imprisoned for owning Christ, and had in the end grasped~
the crown of his testimony by being burnt alive.
