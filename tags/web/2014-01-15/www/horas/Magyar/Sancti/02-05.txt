The blessed Agatha * stood in the midst of the prison, and stretched forth her~
hands, and prayed unto the Lord, saying: O Lord Jesus Christ, my Good Master, I~
thank thee because Thou hast made me to overcome the cruelty of the executioners~
and now, O Lord, may it please thee that I should happily attain unto thy glory,~
which fadeth not away.

O Lord, Thou hast seen * how I have fought, and how I have run in the race; but, because I would not obey the magistrates, they ordered me to be tortured in the breasts;;14

!Sir 51:1-7
1 Jézusnak, Sirák fiának imádsága. Hálát adok neked, Uram Királyom! És dicsérlek~
téged, szabadító Istenemet.
2 Hálát adok a te nevednek, mert segítöm és oltalmazóm lettél.
3 Megszabadítottad testemet a romlástól, a rosz nyelvek törétöl, és a hazudságot~
koholók ajkaitól, és az ellenem állók szine elött segitöm lettél.
4 És megszabadítottál engem a te neved irgalmának sokasága szerint az~
elnyelésemre készölt ordítóktól,
5 az én lelkemet keresök kezeiböl, és a háborúság kapuiból, mely körölvett engem,
6 a láng égetésétöl, mely körölvett engem, és a töz közepett nem égtem meg,
7 a pokol gyomrának mélységéböl, és a megfertözött nyelvtöl, és a hazug igétöl,~
az igazságtalan királytól és az álnok nyelvtöl.

[Responsory1]
R. While the blessed Agatha was being grievously tortured in the breasts, she~
said to the judge
* Thou foul, cruel, and bloody tyrant, art thou not ashamed to do this to me,~

V. I have breasts within, which have been the Lord's from my childhood, and them~
thou canst not mangle.
R. Thou foul, cruel, and bloody tyrant, art thou not ashamed to do this to me,~
having thyself sucked at a mother's breast?

[Lectio2]
!Sir 51:8-12
8 Mindhalálig dicséri lelkem az Urat;
9 mert életem közelgetett lefelé a pokolhoz.
10 Körölvettek engem mindenfelöl, és nem volt, ki segítsen; körölnéztem az~
emberek segítsége után, és nem volt.
11 Ekkor megemlékeztem a te irgalmasságodról, Uram! és azokról, miket öröktöl~
fogva cselekedtél;
12 hogy kimented, Uram, a te rád várakozókat, és kiszabadítod öket a pogányok~
kezeiböl.

13 Felmagasztaltad a földön lakhelyemet és az elmúló halálért könyörögtem.
14 Segítségöl hittam az Urat, az én Uram Atyját, hogy ne hagyjon engem~

15 Dicsérni fogom a te nevedet szüntelen, és dicsérem azt hálaadással, mert~

[Lectio4]
The Maiden Agatha was a Sicilian of noble birth. The citizens of Palermo and~
Catania dispute as to which city had the honour of being her birthplace. It was~
at Catania that, during the persecution under the Emperor Decius, she won the~
crown of a glorious martyrdom. She was equally celebrated for her beauty and her~
chastity, and Quintianus, Praetor of Sicily, conceived a passion for her. He~
tried every sort of device to overcome her modesty, and when he found it~
impossible to make her consent to his wishes, he caused her to be arrested on a~
charge of Christian superstition, and handed over to a woman named Aphrodisia to~
be corrupted. The company, however, of this woman had no effect in shaking her~
constancy in the Christian worship, nor her settled determination to preserve~
her purity. Aphrodisia therefore reported to Quintianus that she was only~
throwing away her pains on Agatha. He ordered her to be brought before him. Thou,~
said he, art the daughter of a noble family dost thou feel no shame in living~
the degraded and slavish life of a Christian? Agatha answered him, The lowliness~
and bondage of a Christian are far nobler than the estate and pride of a king.

[Responsory4]
R. But by the Lord's help I will continue to acknowledge Him Who hath saved me
* And strengthened me.
V. I thank thee, O my Lord Jesus Christ, because Thou hast sent thine Apostle~
unto me to heal my wounds.
R. And strengthened me.

[Lectio5]
Then the Praetor, being incensed against her, gave her the alternative of either~
sacrificing to the gods, or being submitted to the torture; and as she remained~
firm in the faith, she was buffeted and sent back to prison. The next day she~
was brought forth, and, because her resolution was still unshaken, she was~
stretched on the rack and tortured with pieces of white-hot metal. Then her~
breasts were cut off. When Agatha received this injury she cried out to~
Quintianus, Cruel tyrant, art thou not ashamed to do this to me, having thyself~
sucked at a mother's breast? She was remanded again to prison and put in irons.~
That night an old man, who called himself an Apostle of Christ, came to her, and~
healed her wounds. The following day she was brought for the last time before~
the Praetor. Her constancy was unmoved, and she was rolled on sharp potsherds~
and live embers.

[Responsory5]
R. He hath cured me Who hath sent His Apostle Peter to the prison to strengthen~
me, after I was ordered to be put on the rack.
* Because of my chastity, help me, O Lord my God, for they are torturing my~
breasts.
V. He hath vouchsafed to heal me of all my wounds, and to put new paps on my~
breasts.
R. Because of my chastity, help me, O Lord my God, for they are torturing my~
breasts.

[Lectio6]
At that time the whole city was shaken with a great earthquake, and two of the~
Praetor's dearest friends, Silvinus and Falconius, were killed by falling walls.~
The townspeople were in an uproar, and Quintianus, in fear of a riot, ordered~
Agatha, who was half dead, to be carried back to prison quietly. Then she made~
the following prayer O Lord, Who hast been my Keeper from my childhood, Who~
hast taken from me all love for this present world, Who hast strengthened me so~
that I am more than conqueror over the cruelty of the executioners, receive my~
spirit, and with these words she passed to heaven. She finished her testimony on~
the th day of February, (in the year of our Lord 251.) Her body was buried by~
the Christians.

[Responsory6]
R. O Lord, Thou hast seen and known how I have fought, and how I have run in the~
race; but, because I would not obey the magistrates
* They ordered me to be tortured in the breasts.
V. Because of truth, and meekness, and righteousness,
R. They ordered me to be tortured in the breasts.
&Gloria
R. They ordered me to be tortured in the breasts.

Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kõnyvébõl
!Matt 19:3-12
Azon idõben odamentek Jézushoz a farizeusok, hogy próbára tegyék. Ezt kérdezték:~
"El szabad a férfinek bármilyen okból bocsátania a feleségét?" És így tovább.
_
Homily by St John Chrysostom, Patriarch of (Constantinople.)
!63th on Matthew.
Seeing that directly to exhort them unto virginity was well-nigh more than they~
could bear, our Lord seeketh to draw them to the desire thereof, taking occasion~
by the needfulness of a law against divorce. Then He showeth that virginity is~
possible, saying There are some eunuchs which were so born from their mother's~
womb; and there are some eunuchs which were made eunuchs of men; and there be~
eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. In~
these words He persuadeth them indirectly to choose virginity, while He teacheth~
them that such a gift is not so good as to be impossible.

[Responsory7]
R. When the blessed Agatha came into the prison, she stretched forth her hands~
to God, and said O Lord, Who hast made me to overcome the cruelty of the~
executioners
* May it please thee that I should attain unto thy mercy.
V. O Lord, Who hast made me, Who hast taken from me all love for this present~
world, and Who hast saved my body from pollution,
R. May it please thee that I should attain unto thy mercy.

[Lectio8]
This doctrine He establisheth somewhat thus. Supposing that thou hadst been born a~
eunuch by nature, or hadst been made a eunuch by the cruelty of men, so that~
thou hadst no sexual enjoyment, and hadst no credit for having none, what~
wouldest thou do? Give God thanks therefore, that thou dost, for a reward and a~
crown, what such others suffer with no reward and no crown yea, and that, rather a~
lighter burden than the same, and that not only because thou hast the joy of~
hope, and of knowing that thou doest well, but also because thou art not so~
battered by storms of desire as they are.

[Responsory8]
R. I have used no earthly medicine for my body, but I have for a Master, Christ~
Jesus
* By Whose Word alone all things are made.
V. He hath vouchsafed to heal me of all my wounds, and to put new paps on my~
breasts, and upon Him will I call, even upon the Living God.
R. By Whose Word alone all things are made.
&Gloria
R. By Whose Word alone all things are made.

[Lectio9]
When, therefore, He had spoken of such as are eunuchs by nature, or by~
mutilation, and are eunuchs vainly and uselessly, unless they also bridle their~
thoughts, and of such as deny themselves for the kingdom of heaven's sake, He~
added He that is able to receive it, let him receive it, that He might make~
them the readier by showing the very sternness of the work, and, in His~
unspeakable goodness, He would not include any such precept within the~
requirements of the law, and, by saying this, showeth it to be the more possible,~
that He might increase the desire of freely choosing it.

The heathen multitude made haste * and came to the grave of the virgin, and took~
therefrom her veil wherewith to stem the fire; that the Lord might show~
Himself to be a Deliverer from the burning, for the sake of Agatha, His blessed~
Martyr.

[Oratio]
O God, Who, amidst the wondrous work of thy Divine power, dost make even weak~

Agatha, born in Sicily of noble parents, suffered a glorious martyrdom at~
Catania In the persecution of the emperor Decius. For when Quintianus, the~
praetor of Sicily, had vainly tried every means to tempt her from her virginity,~
he had her arrested as adhering to the Christian superstition. First she was~
beaten,then tortured on the rack with whit hot iron plates laid on her; then one~
of her. breasts was cut off. Next she was thrown into prison, where St. Peter~
the Apostle appeared to her by night and healed her. Again called before the~
praetor she persevered in confessing Christ, and he had her rolled over broken~
pottery and burning coals. But then a great earthquake violently shook the city,~
and Ouintianus, afraid of a riot among the people,gave orders that Agatha, now~
half dead, secretly be taken back to prison. There after a short time she went~
to heaven on February 5.
