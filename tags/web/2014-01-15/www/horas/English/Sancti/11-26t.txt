!Commemoration S. Peter of Alexandria
This Peter succeeded that eminent Saint, Theonas, as Pope of Alexandria, (in the~
year of our Lord 300,) and the glory of his holiness and teaching hath~
enlightened not Egypt only, but the whole Church of God. The wondrous patience~
wherewith he bore the roughness of the times in the persecution under Maximian~
Galerius caused many greatly to increase in Christian graces. He was the first~
who cut off Arius, then a Deacon of Alexandria, from the Communion of the~
faithful, on account of his leaning to the Meletian schism. He was condemned to~
death by Maximian, and was in prison when there came to him the two Priests~
Achilles and Alexander to plead for Arius, but Peter told them that Jesus had~
appeared to him in the night clad in a rent garment, and when he asked what was~
thereby signified, had said unto him Arius hath torn My vesture, which is the~
Church. Also, he foretold to them that they should be Popes of Alexandria after~
him, and strictly commanded them never to receive Arius into Communion, because~
he knew him to be dead in the sight of God. That this was a true prophecy the~
event did shortly prove. At length, in the twelfth year of his Popedom, upon the~
26th day of November, (in the year of salvation 311,) his head was cut off, and~
he went hence to receive the crown of his testimony.
