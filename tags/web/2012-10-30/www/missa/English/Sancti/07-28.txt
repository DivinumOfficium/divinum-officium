Lesson from the book of Wisdom
!Wis 10:17-20
God gave the holy ones the recompense of their labors, conducted them by a wondrous road, and became a shelter for them by day and a starry flame by night. He took them across the Red Sea and brought them through the deep waters - but their enemies He drowned in the sea, and cast them up from the bottom of the depths. Therefore the just despoiled the wicked; and they sang, O Lord, Your holy name and praised in unison Your conquering hand, O Lord, our God.

[Graduale]
!Ex 15:11, 6.
God is glorious in His Saints, wonderful in majesty, a worker of wonders.
V. Your right hand, O Lord, is magnificent in power; Your right hand has~
shattered the enemy. Alleluia, alleluia.
!Sir 44:14
V. The bodies of the Saints are buried in peace, but their name lives on and on.~
Alleluia.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 21:9-19
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples, When you hear of wars and~
insurrections, do not be terrified; these things must first come to pass, but~
the end will not be at once. Then He said to them, Nation will rise against~
nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be great earthquakes in~
various places, and pestilences and famines, and there will be terrors and great~
signs from heaven. But before all these things they will arrest you and~
persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, dragging you~
before kings and governors for My name’s sake. It shall lead to your bearing~
witness. Resolve therefore in your hearts not to meditate beforehand how you are~
to make your defense. For I Myself will give you utterance and wisdom, which~
all your adversaries will not be able to resist or gainsay. But you will be~
delivered up by your parents and brothers and relatives and friends; and some of~
you they will put to death. And you will be hated by all for My name’s sake; yet~
not a hair of your head shall perish. By your patience you will win your souls.

[Offertorium]
!Ps 67:36
God is wonderful in His Saints; the God of Israel is He Who gives power and~
strength to His people. Blessed be God! Alleluia.

[Secreta]
Grant, almighty God, that we may please You by these gifts which we bring in~
honor of Your Saints Nazarius, Celsus, Victor and Innocent, so that by offering~
them we may be strengthened by Your accepting them.

[Communio]
!Wis 3:4-6
For if before men they be punished, God tried them; as gold in the furnace, He~
proved them, and as sacrificial offerings He took them to Himself.

[Postcommunio]
Be appeased by the prayers of Your Saints Nazarius, Celsus, Victor and Innocent, O~
Lord, and grant, we beseech You, that the rites we perform in this life may~
avail for our eternal salvation.
