56:1 (Unto the end, destroy not, for David, for an inscription of a title, when he fled from Saul into the cave. [1 Kings 24.])
56:2 Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me: for my soul trusteth in thee. And in the shadow of thy wings will I hope, until iniquity pass away.
56:3 I will cry to God the most high; to God who hath done good to me.
56:4 He hath sent from heaven and delivered me: he hath made them a reproach that trod upon me. God hath sent his mercy and his truth,
56:5 And he hath delivered my soul from the midst of the young lions. I slept troubled. The sons of men, whose teeth are weapons and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.
56:6 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, and thy glory above all the earth.
56:7 They prepared a snare for my feet; and they bowed down my soul. They dug a pit before my face, and they are fallen into it.
56:8 My heart is ready, O God, my heart is ready: I will sing, and rehearse a psalm.
56:9 Arise, O my glory, arise psaltery and harp: I will arise early.
56:10 I will give praise to thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing a psalm to thee among the nations.
56:11 For thy mercy is magnified even to the heavens: and thy truth unto the clouds.
56:12 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth.
