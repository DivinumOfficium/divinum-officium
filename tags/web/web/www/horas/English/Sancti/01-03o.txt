Lesson from the book of Revelations
!Rev 4:1-4
1 After these things I looked, and behold a door was opened in heaven, and the~
first voice which I heard, as it were, of a trumpet speaking with me, said: Come~
up hither, and I will shew thee the things which must be done hereafter.
2 And immediately I was in the spirit: and behold there was a throne set in~
heaven, and upon the throne one sitting.
3 And he that sat, was to the sight like the jasper and the sardine stone; and~
there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.
4 And round about the throne were four and twenty seats; and upon the seats,~
four and twenty ancients sitting, clothed in white garments, and on their heads~
were crowns of gold.

[Lectio2]
!Rev 4:5-8
5 And from the throne proceeded lightnings, and voices, and thunders; and there~
were seven lamps burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God.
6 And in the sight of the throne was, as it were, a sea of glass like to crystal;~
and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four living~
creatures, full of eyes before and behind.
7 And the first living creature was like a lion: and the second living creature~
like a calf: and the third living creature, having the face, as it were, of a~
man: and the fourth living creature was like an eagle flying.
8 And the four living creatures had each of them six wings; and round about and~
within they are full of eyes. And they rested not day and night, saying: Holy,~
holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come.

[Lectio3]
!Rev 4:8-11
8 And the four living creatures had each of them six wings; and round about and~
within they are full of eyes. And they rested not day and night, saying: Holy,~
holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come.
9 And when those living creatures gave glory, and honour, and benediction to him~
that sitteth on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever;
10 The four and twenty ancients fell down before him that sitteth on the throne,~
and adored him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the~
throne, saying:
11 Thou art worthy, O Lord our God, to receive glory, and honour, and power:~
because thou hast created all things; and for thy will they were, and have been~
created.

[Lectio4]
The Lesson is taken from a treatise of St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo,)
! on John. (36.) 
Of the Four Evangelists, or, rather, the Four Writers of the 'one Evangel,~
the holy Apostle John hath not unworthily been compared by spiritual writers to~
an eagle, because of the lofty and glorious flight of his teaching, soaring~
above the other three; a flight that raiseth not himself alone, but also the~
hearts of all, whosoever will hear him. The other three writers walk with the~
Lord upon earth, as with a man, and enlarge little upon His Godhead; but John,~
as though it had wearied him to walk upon earth, in the very first words of his~
writing, riseth not above the earth only, or above the firmament, and the~
heavens, but above every angel, and above every power of things unseen, and~
flieth directly to Him by Whom all things were made, saying In the beginning~
was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

[Lectio5]
Then he goeth on worthily of such a beginning, and speaketh of the Lord's~
Godhead as none hath ever spoken, uttering freely the things which he had heard.~
It is not without cause that it is told of him in that Gospel how he lay on~
Jesus' Breast at supper. Truly he drank secretly from that Breast, and what he~
drank secretly he hath uttered openly, that all men may know not only how the~
Son of God became man, suffered, and rose again for us, but likewise how He was~
with the Father before He took flesh, the Onlybegotten Son, the Word of the~
Father, co-eternal with Him that begat Him, equal to Him That sent Him.

[Lectio6]
John is an eagle that soareth up to the things that are not made, and fixeth his~
eye unquailing upon the secret and eternal Light. It is said that the~
father-eagle taketh his young in his talons and flieth with them, that they may~
look at the sun. Them that look at it boldly, he acknowledgeth for his own~
offspring, but them whose eyes shrink, he letteth fall from his claws as~
bastards. Let us consider, then, how mightily he must speak who is likened to an~
eagle; and yet we who are reptiles crawling on earth, weak, and of small~
consideration even among men, dare take in hand these utterances, to treat of~
them, and to explain them, and think that our intelligence understandeth them,~
or our speech commendeth them.

[Lectio7]
From the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 21:20-24
In that time Jesus said to Peter: Follow me. Peter turning about, saw that~
disciple whom Jesus loved following. And so on.
_
Homily by St John Chrysostom, Patriarch (of Constantinople.)
!87th Homily. on John.
Christ had made known great things to Peter, charged him with the care of the~
whole world, announced to him his future martyrdom, and given him testimony of~
His especial love. Peter then would have John for a fellow and helper, and he~
said, What shall this man do? as it were, Shall not he also follow the same~
path with me? At the supper, when Peter would ask a question of the Lord, he~
dared not, but got John for his spokesman; and now Peter asketh that which he~
thought John fain would know, but dared not ask for himself. Christ saith unto~
him If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?

[Lectio8]
Peter asked because of his great love for John, hoping not to be parted from him,~
and Christ answered him, that with whatever affection he loved him, he could not~
love him as He loved him. If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to~
thee? Let us learn from these words, by the teaching of Christ, neither to~
chafe, nor to enquire too curiously, where the will of God is concerned. For~
when Peter would be still asking, the Lord at length checked him in these words~
for his continued curiosity.

[Lectio9]
When went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not~
die; yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry~
till I come, what is that to thee? That is, He would not have it thought that~
He had disposed of them both in the same way. He spoke thus that He might check~
the untimely motion of affection, and the desire to continue the old~
companionship. The Apostles were about to take in charge the whole earth, and it~
behoved them no more to continue together, lest the world should suffer.~
Therefore the Lord saith to Peter Thou hast received thy task; bend thyself~
to it, and do it; work and fight; what is it to thee if I will that he tarry~
here? Turn thou to thine own appointed labour and finish it.
