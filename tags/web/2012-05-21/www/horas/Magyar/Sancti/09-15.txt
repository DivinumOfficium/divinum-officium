[Hymnus Matutinum]
That a sea of tears and sorrow
Did the soul of Mary toss
To and fro upon its billows,
While she wept her bitter loss;
In her arms her Jesus holding,
Torn so newly from the Cross.
_
Oh, that mournful Virgin-Mother!
See her tears how fast they flow
Down upon His mangled body,
Wounded side, and thorny brow;
While His hands and feet she kisses—
Picture of immortal woe.
_
Oft and oft His arms and bosom
Fondly straining to her own;
Oft her pallid lips imprinting
On each wound of her dear Son;
Till at last, in swoons of anguish,
Sense and consciousness are gone.
_
Gentle Mother, we beseech thee
By thy tears and troubles sore;
By the death of thy dear Offspring,
By the bloody wounds He bore;
Touch our hearts with that true sorrow
Which afflicted thee of yore.
_
To the Father everlasting,
And the Son who reigns on high,
With the co-eternal Spirit,
Trinity in Unity,
Be salvation, honor, blessing
Now and through eternity.
Ámen.

Ne nézzetek le * amiért barna vagyok, hiszen a nap barnított le! Anyámnak fiai nehezteltek rám

Álljunk a kereszt mellé Szûz Máriával Jézus anyjával * az õ lelkét is a fájdalom tõre járta át

[Hymnus Vespera]
v. Nov let the darkling eve mount suddenly on high,
The sun affrighted reave his splendours from the sky,
While I in silence grieve o'er the mocked agony
And the divine catastrophe.
_
Grief-drenched, thou dost appear with heart of adamant,
O Mother; and dost hear the great hierophant,
Upon his wooden bier locked in the arms of death,
Utter in groans his parting breath.
_
What lookest thou upon, mangled and bruised and torn?
Ah, 'tis the very Son thy yearning breast bath borne!
Surely, each breaking moan and each deep-mouthèd wound
Its fellow in thy heart hath found!
_
Surely, the taunts and woes, the scourge, the dripping thorn,
The spitting and the blows, the gall, the lance, the scorn—
Surely, each torment throws a poison-dart at thee,
Crushed by their manifold tyranny.
_
Yet thou with patient mien beneath his cross dost stand,
Nobler in this, I ween, than all the martyr-band:
A thousand deaths, O Queen, upon thy spirit lie,
Yet thou, O marvel! dost not die.
_
O Holy Trinity, let earth and heaven raise
Their song of laud to thee the while my spirit prays:—
When evil comes to me, the strength do thou impart
That erst upheld thy Mother's heart!
Ámen.

Olvasmány Jeremiás próféta siralmainak könyvébõl
!Lam 1:2; 1:20-21
2 Csak sír, egyre sír éjjelente, könnyei peregnek az arcán. Azok közül, akik szerették, egy sincs, hogy vigasztalja. Barátai mind cserbenhagyták, és ellenségeivé lettek.
20 Nézd, Uram, mennyire szorongok! Megrendült egész bensõm, s a szívem megfordult bennem. Bizony, mennyit lázongtam ellened! És most kívül fiaimtól foszt meg a kard, belül meg a halál pusztít.
21 Halld meg, mennyit sóhajtozom, mert nincs, aki vigasztaljon! Ellenségeim mind ujjonganak pusztulásom hírére, amiért így bántál velem. Hozd el hát a napot, amelyet megígértél, hadd legyenek hozzám hasonlóvá!

[Responsory1]
R. There was a man whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout; and he said unto Mary
* Yea, a sword shall pierce through thine own soul also.
V. Call me not My-pleasantness, but call me Embittered, for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.
R. Yea, a sword shall pierce through thine own soul also.

!Lam 2:13-16
13 Mihez hasonlítsalak, mivel vesselek össze, Jeruzsálem leánya? Ki tudna megvigasztalni, Sionnak szûz leánya? Mert nagy, mint a tenger, a fájdalmad. Ki gyógyíthatna meg?
14 Amit prófétáid jövendöltek neked, az csalárdság volt és balgaság. Soha nem tárták fel vétkedet, hogy indítsanak megtérésre, Hamis látomásokkal hitegettek, becsaptak és félrevezettek.
15 Akiknek erre visz az útjuk, összecsapják a kezüket, amikor meglátnak. Felszisszennek, fejüket csóválják Jeruzsálem leánya miatt: "Ezzé lett a szépek szépe, az egész földnek ékessége?"
16 Kitárta ellened a száját minden ellenséged. Füttyentenek, fogukat csikorgatják, és ezt mondják: "Felfaltuk! Ez az a nap, amelyre vártunk megértük, megláttuk."

[Responsory2]
R. Arise, and take the young Child and His Mother, and flee into Egypt;
* And be thou there until I bring thee word.

R. And be thou there until I bring thee word.

!Lam 2:17-18
17 Amit elhatározott, azt végbevitte az Úr, teljesítette szavát, amelyet már rég kimondott. Könyörtelenül lerombolt! Ellenségeid ujjonghatnak fölötted, mert eltöltötte õket erõvel.
18 Kiálts szívbõl az Úrhoz, zokogj, Sion leánya! Mint a patak, úgy folyjon a könnyed éjjel és nappal! Ne tarts pihenõt, ne szûnjék meg sírni a szemed!

[Responsory3]
R. Son, why hast Thou thus dealt with us?
* I and thy father have sought thee sorrowing.
V. How is it that ye sought Me? Wist ye not that I must be about My Father's business?
R. I and thy Father
&Gloria
R. Have sought thee sorrowing.

[Lectio4]
From the Sermons of St Bernard, Abbat (of Clairvaux.)
!On the twelve stars.
The Martyrdom of the Virgin is set before us, not only in the prophecy of Simeon, but also in the story itself of the Lord's Passion. The holy old man said of the Child Jesus, (Luke ii. 34,) Behold, this Child is set for the fall and the rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against; yea, (said he unto Mary,) a sword shall pierce through thine own soul also Even so, O Blessed Mother! The sword did indeed pierce through thy soul! for nought could pierce the Body of thy Son, nor pierce thy soul likewise. Yea, and when this Jesus of thine had given up the ghost, and the bloody spear could torture Him no more, thy soul winced as it pierced His dead Side His Own Soul might leave Him, but thine could not.

[Responsory4]
R. Jesus bearing His Cross, went forth.
* And there followed Him a company of women, which bewailed and lamented Him.
V. Daughters of Jerusalem, weep for yourselves and for your children.
R. There followed Him a company of women, which bewailed and lamented Him.

[Lectio5]
The sword of sorrow pierced through thy soul, so that we may truly call thee more than martyr, in whom the love, that made thee suffer along with thy Son, wrung thy heart more bitterly than any pang of bodily pain could do. Did not that word of His indeed pierce through thy soul, sharper than any two-edged~
sword, even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, (Heb. iv. 12,) Woman, behold thy son! (John xix. 26.) O what a change to thee! Thou art given John for Jesus, the servant for his Lord, the disciple for his Master, the son of Zebedee for the Son of God, a mere man for Very God. O how keenly must the hearing of those words have pierced through thy most loving soul, when even our hearts, stony, iron, as they are, are wrung at the memory thereof only!

[Responsory5]
R. And when they were come to the place which is called Calvary, there they crucified Him.
* Now there stood by the Cross of Jesus His Mother.
V. Then was it that a sword of sorrow pierced through her blessed soul.
R. There stood by the Cross of Jesus His Mother.

[Lectio6]
Marvel not, my brethren, that Mary should be called a Martyr in spirit. He indeed may marvel who remembereth not what Paul saith, naming the greater sins of the Gentiles, that they were without natural affection, (Rom. i. 31.) Far other were the bowels of Mary, and far other may those of her servants be! But some man perchance will say Did she not know that He was to die? Yea, without doubt, she knew it. Did she not hope that He was soon to rise again? Yea, she most faithfully hoped it. And did she still mourn because He was crucified? Yea, bitterly. But who art thou, my brother, or whence hast thou such wisdom, to marvel less that the Son of Mary suffered than that Mary suffered with Him? He could die in the Body, and could not she die with Him in her heart? His was the~
deed of that Love, greater than which hath no man, (John xv. 13;) her's, of a love, like to which hath no man, save He.

[Responsory6]
R. Joseph of Arimathaea begged the Body of Jesus, and he took It down from the Cross,
* And His Mother received It into her arms.
V. l The Shunamite took her dead son, and laid him on her knees; and her soul was vexed within her.
R. His Mother received It into her arms.
&Gloria
R. His Mother received It into her arms.

Evangélium szent János Apostol kõnyvébõl
!John 19:25-27
Azon idõben Jézus keresztje alatt ott állt anyja, anyjának nõvére, Mária, aki Kleofás felesége volt és Mária Magdolna. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, (Bishop of Milan.)
!On Virgins, 7.
There stood by the Cross His Mother. Men had forsaken Him, but she stood there fearless. Behold how the Mother of Jesus could break through her shrinking modesty, but could not belie her heart. With the eyes of a mother's love she gazed upon the Wounds of her Son, those Wounds through Which she knew that redemption for all mankind was flowing. The Mother, who feared not the executioners, was able to endure the sight of their work. Her Son was hanging upon the Cross, and she braved His tormentors.

[Responsory7]
R. O what a sickening at heart was thine, thou Mother of sorrows
* When Joseph wrapped thy Son in linen and laid Him in the sepulchre?
V. Behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow.
R. When Joseph wrapped thy Son in linen and laid Him in the sepulchre.

[Lectio8]
!From St Ambrose, 25 th Epistle to the Church of Vercelli.
Mary, the Mother of the Lord, stood by the Cross of her Son. My only informant of this fact is the holy Evangelist John. Others have written that when the Lord suffered, the earth quaked, the heavens were veiled in darkness, the sun was hidden, and the thief received, after a good confession, the promise of Paradise. John hath taught us what the others have not taught us. Upon the Cross~
He called her Mother. It is reckoned (by John) a greater thing that in the moment of triumph over agony, He should have discharged the watchful duty of a Son to His Mother, than that He should have made gift of the kingdom of heaven. For if it be a sacred thing to have forgiven the thief, this so great kindness of the Son to the Mother is to be worshipped as the outcome of a tenderer and more touching love.

[Responsory8]
R. Forget not the sorrows of thy mother with thine whole heart,
* That thine offering and thy blessing may be perfected.
V. Hail, O maid of Royal birth, Noblest martyr-rose of earth, lily of virginity.
R. That thine offering and thy blessing may be perfected.
&Gloria
R. That thine offering and thy blessing may be perfected.

God of mercy, let us run
Where yon fount of sorrows flows;
Pondering sweetly, one by one,
Jesu's Wounds and Mary's woes.

Ah, those tears Our Lady shed,
Enough to drown a world of sin;
Tears that Jesu's sorrows fed,
Peace and pardon well may win!

His five Wounds, a very home,
For our prayers and praises prove;
And Our Lady's woes become
Endless joys in heaven above.

All on thee our love we pour;
And in the Holy Trinity
Worship thee forevermore.
