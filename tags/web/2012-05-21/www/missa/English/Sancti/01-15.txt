Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Philippians
!Phil 3:7-12
Brethren: The things that were gain to me, these, for the sake of Christ, I have counted loss. Nay more, I count everything loss because of the excelling knowledge of Jesus Christ, my Lord. For His sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and I count them as dung that I may gain Christ and be found in Him, not having a justice of my own, which is from the Law, but that which is from faith in Christ, the justice from God based upon faith; so that I may know Him and the power of His Resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings: become like to Him in death, in the hope that somehow I may attain to the resurrection from the dead. Not that I have already obtained this, or already have been made perfect, but I press on hoping that I may lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus has laid hold of me.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt. 11:25-30
At that time, Jesus spoke and said, I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and~
earth, that You hid these things from the wise and prudent, and revealed them to~
little ones. Yes, Father, for such was Your good pleasure. All things have been~
delivered to Me by My Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father; nor~
does anyone know the Father except the Son, and him to whom the Son chooses to~
reveal Him. Come to Me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will give you~
rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn from Me, for I am meek and humble of~
heart; and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden~
light.

!Ps 20:2-3
O Lord, in Your strength the just man is glad; in Your victory how greatly he~
rejoices! You have granted him his heart’s desire.
