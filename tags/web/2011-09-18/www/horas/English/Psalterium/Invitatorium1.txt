O come, let us sing unto the Lord : let us make a joyful~
noise to the God of our salvation.
Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful~
noise unto Him with psalms.
$ant
For the Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods.
In His hand are the inmost depths of the earth : and the heights of the~
hills are His also.
$ant
For the sea is His, and He made it, and His hands formed the dry land.
$ant
And we are the people of His pasture, and the sheep of His hand. Today~
if ye will hear His voice, harden not your heart.
As in the Provocation, and as in the day of Temptation~
in the wilderness, when your fathers tempted Me, and proved Me,~
and saw My works.
$ant
Forty years long was I grieved with that generation, and said : It is a~
people that do alway err in their heart.
And they have not known My ways; unto whom I sware in My wrath that~
they should not enter into My rest.
$ant
&Gloria
