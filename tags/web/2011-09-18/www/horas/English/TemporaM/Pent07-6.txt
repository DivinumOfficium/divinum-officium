Lesson from the first book of Kings
!1 Kgs 7:51; 8:1-2
51 And Solomon finished all the work that he made in the house of the Lord, and~
brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, the silver and the~
gold, and the vessels, and laid them up in the treasures of the house of the~
Lord.
1 Then all the ancients of Israel with the princes of the tribes, and the heads~
of the families of the children of Israel were assembled to king Solomon in~
Jerusalem: that they might carry the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the~
city of David, that is, out of Sion.
2 And all Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon on the festival day in the~
month of Ethanim, the same is the seventh month.

3 And all the ancients of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark,
4 And carried the ark of the Lord, and the tabernacle of the covenant, and all~
the vessels of the sanctuary, that were in the tabernacle: and the priests and~
the Levites carried them.
5 And king Solomon, and all the multitude of Israel, that were assembled unto~
him went with him before the ark, and they sacrificed sheep and oxen that could~
not be counted or numbered.
6 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord into its place,~
into the oracle of the temple, into the holy of holies under the wings of the~
cherubims.
7 For the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and~
covered the art, and the staves thereof above

!1 Kgs 8:9-12
9 Now in the ark there was nothing else but the two tables of stone, which Moses~
put there at Horeb, when the Lord made a covenant with the children of Israel,~
when they came out of the land of Egypt.
10 And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the sanctuary, that a~
cloud filled the house of the Lord,
11 And the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the~
glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord.
12 Then Solomon said: The Lord said that he would dwell in a cloud.
