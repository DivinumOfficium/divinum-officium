From the holy Gospel according to Mark.
!Mark 6:47-56
In that time when it was late, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and Jesus~
himself alone on the land. And so on.
_
Homily by the Venerable Bede, Priest (at Jarrow) and Doctor of the Church.
!Bk. ii., cap. 6, on Mark vi. 45
The toil of the disciples in rowing, and the wind contrary to them, is a figure~
of the divers toils of the Holy Church, as, amid the waves of a world that~
fighteth against her, and the stormy blasts of unclean spirits, she laboureth to~
reach the rest of her Fatherland above, as a shore safe for her anchor. Here~
also it is well said that the ship was in the midst of the sea, and He alone on~
the land; for sometimes it cometh to pass that the Church is, by the great~
pressure of the Gentiles, not only so afflicted, but also befouled, that it~
seemeth as though, if it were possible, her Redeemer had for the time forsaken~
her.

Whence it is that there cometh that cry of hers, when she is taken amid the~
waves, and the winds of temptations that break upon her, and with piteous~
entreaty she calleth on Him to protect her Why standest Thou afar off, O Lord,~
why hidest Thou thyself in times of trouble? (Ps. ix. 22.) And then, in the~
verses that follow, she telleth Him what saith the enemy that persecuted her,~
saying For he hath said in his heart God hath forgotten; He hideth His face He~
will never see it. (32.)

Verily, He forgetteth not the prayer of the poor, neither turneth He His face~
away from any that putteth his trust in Him; yea, rather, to him whosoever is~
striving with the enemy, He giveth help to conquer, and, whosoever conquereth,~
to him He giveth an everlasting crown. For the which reason also it is here said~
plainly He saw them toiling in rowing. The Lord seeth them that are toiling in~
the sea, albeit He be Himself on the land. Although He seem for a moment to~
tarry in succouring the distressed, nevertheless the look of His love is~
strengthening them, all the while, lest they should faint and sometimes He~
setteth them free, even by an open deliverance, conquering all their adversaries~
for them, as when He walked upon the swelling of the waves, and stilled them.

v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Mark
!Mark 6:47-56
6:47 And when it was late, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and himself alone on the land.
6:48 And seeing them labouring in rowing, (for the wind was against them,) and about the fourth watch of the night, he cometh to them walking upon the sea, and he would have passed by them.
6:49 But they seeing him walking upon the sea, thought it was an apparition, and they cried out.
6:50 For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he spoke with them, and said to them: Have a good heart, it is I, fear ye not.
6:51 And he went up to them into the ship, and the wind ceased: and they were far more astonished within themselves:
6:52 For they understood not concerning the loaves; for their heart was blinded.
6:53 And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Genezareth, and set to the shore.
6:54 And when they were gone out of the ship, immediately they knew him:
6:55 And running through that whole country, they began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.
6:56 And whithersoever he entered, into towns or into villages or cities, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch but the hem of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.
