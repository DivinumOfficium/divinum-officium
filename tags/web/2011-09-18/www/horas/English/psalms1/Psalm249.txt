(Canticum Ecclesiasticae * Eccli 39:17-21)
39:17 By a voice he saith: Hear me, ye divine offspring, and bud forth as the rose planted by the brooks of waters.
39:18 Give ye a sweet odour as frankincense.
39:19 Send forth flowers, as the lily, and yield a smell, and bring forth leaves in grace, and praise with canticles, and bless the Lord in his works.
39:20 Magnify his name, and give glory to him with the voice of your lips, and with the canticles of your mouths, and with harps, and in praising him, you shall say in this manner:
39:21 All the works of the Lord are exceeding good.
