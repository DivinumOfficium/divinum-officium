O God, Who lovest virginity, and who didst make thy blessed Virgin Mary Magdalen~
a-fire with the love of thyself, and rich with thy heavenly gifts, grant unto us,~
who honour her memory by a yearly feast, the grace to copy the ensample of her~
purity and of her tenderness.

[Lectio4]
This Mary Magdalen was born of the noble Florentine family of the Pazzi, (on the~
2nd day of April, in the year of Christ 1566.) She was hardly out of her cradle~
when she set her feet in the path of perfection. At ten years of age she made a~
vow of perpetual virginity, and (at fifteen) took the habit of the Order of~
Mount Carmel, in the convent of Saint Mary of the Angels. In that sisterhood she~
was in all ways a pattern to all. She was pure to that degree, that she did not~
even know of the existence of anything which can hurt modesty. For the space of~
five years, by the command of God, she lived upon nothing but bread and water,~
the Lord's Day only excepted, in which she used the food which is taken in Lent.~
She chastised her body with hair-cloth, scourging, cold, hunger, watching,~
nakedness, and all manner of hardships.

[Lectio5]
The love of God was so hot within her, that she was sometimes fain to bathe her~
breast with cold water to allay the agitation. She was oftentimes rapt in the~
spirit, and that most marvellously, for whole days at a time, during which~
trances she saw things hidden and heavenly, and was enlightened of God with~
great gifts. But after all these things she had a stern tussling with the prince~
of the darkness of this world, while God allowed her spirit to remain dry,~
deserted, abandoned by all, and tormented with divers temptations. And all that~
while she remained an ensample of unconquered patience and the deepest~
lowly-mindedness.

[Lectio6]
She was very remarkable for her tender love toward her neighbours. Sometimes she~
went whole nights without sleep, while she was working for the service of the~
sisters, Or waiting upon the sick. She sometimes healed sores even by licking~
them. That there should be unbelievers and sinners perishing caused her bitter~
weeping, and she offered herself to God to suffer for their conversion~
whatsoever He chose. For many years, therefore, before her death, her mighty~
charity towards Others, made her freely to give up that heavenly joy of spirit,~
wherewith she had once so overflowed. She had often in her mouth the words : To~
suffer, not to die. At length, in the forty-second year of her age, on the 25 th~
day of May, in the year 1607, after a long and grievous sickness, the Bridegroom~
came, and she entered with Him into the marriage-chamber. Clement IX., finding~
that God had glorified her by many miracles, both during her life and after her~
death, enrolled her name among those of the Holy Virgins. Her body, up to the~
present day, has never shown the least sign of corruption.

[Lectio94]
Mary Magdalene was born of the famous family of the Pazzi in Florence, and almost from her cradle entered on the way of perfection. At ten years old, she made a vow of perpetual virginity, and when she had taken the habit in the monastery of the Carmelite sisters, she shewed herself to be exemplary in all virtues. She was so chaste that she did not even know of anything that could harm purity. She burned with such a fire of divine love that she was unable to bear it, and had to cool her breast by pouring water over it. She was notable for her love of neighbour, often passing sleepless nights either in doing the work of the sisters, or in serving the sick, whose ulcers she sometimes cured by licking them. She frequently repeated this saying : To suffer, not to die. At length, worn out by a long and serious illness, she went to the Bridegroom in the year 1607, having completed her forty-first year. Clement IX numbered her among the Holy Virgins.
