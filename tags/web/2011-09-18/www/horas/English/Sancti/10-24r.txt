Christ, of the angels praise and adoration,
Father and Saviour thou, of every nation,
Graciously grant us all to gain a station,
Where Thou art reigning.

Angel Physician, health on man bestowing,
Raphael send us from the skies all glowing,
All sickness curing, wisest counsel showing
In doubt and danger.
_
May the fair Mother of the Light be o’er us,
Virgin of peace, with all the angel chorus,
And may the heavenly army go before us,
Guiding and guarding.
_
O May the Godhead, endless bliss possessing,
Father, Son, Spirit, grant to us this blessing;
All His creation joins His praise confessing,
Now and forever.
Amen.

[Ant Matutinum]
When Tobias went in, he found a young man with his loins girded, and as it were ready to set forth, and knowing not that it was an Angel, he saluted him;;8
The Angel Raphael hid himself, and said : I am Azarias, the son of Ananias the Great;;10

V. There was given unto the Angel much incense.
R. That he should offer it upon the golden altar, which is before the presence of the Lord.
And the Angel said, Take the fish by the gill, and draw him out of the water;;18
Tell me, I pray thee, brother Azarias, to what use is that which thou hast bidden me keep of the fish;;23
The gall is a healing to the eyes, but the virtue of the heart and the liver putteth the power of the devil to flight;;33
V. And the smoke of the incense ascended up before the Lord
R. Out of the Angel's hand.
Here is Sara the daughter of Raguel, who shall be given unto thee to wife, and all her substance with her;;95
She hath had seven husbands, who were all strangled by an evil spirit; I am afraid lest the like should befall me;;96
Spend three days in prayer with thy wife, that thou mayest obtain the blessing of sons, in the seed of Abraham;;102
V. The Angel Raphael took hold on the evil spirit.

[Lectio1]
From the Book of Tobias
!Tob 12:1-4
1 Then Tobias called to him his son, and said to him: What can we give to this~
holy man, that is come with thee?
2 Tobias answering, said to his father: Father, what wages shall we give him? or~
what can be worthy of his benefits?
3 He conducted me and brought me safe again, he received the money of Gabelus,~
he caused me to have my wife, and he chased from her the evil spirit, he gave~
joy to her parents, myself he delivered from being devoured by the fish, thee~
also he hath made to see the light of heaven, and we are filled with all good~
things through him. What can we give him sufficient for these things?
4 But I beseech thee, my father, to desire him, that he would vouchsafe to~
accept one half of all things that have been brought.

[Responsory1]
R. At that time the prayers of them twain were heard in the presence of the~
glory of the Most High God
* And holy Raphael, the Angel of the Lord, was sent to heal the twain of them,~
whose prayers had been uttered at one time in the presence of the Lord.
V. Tobias and Sara were in tribulation, and began to pray with tears.
R. And holy Raphael, the Angel of the Lord, was sent to heal the twain of them,~
whose prayers had been uttered at one time in the presence of the Lord.

[Lectio2]
!Tob 12:5-13
5 So the father and the son, calling him, took him aside: and began to desire~
him that he would vouchsafe to accept of half of all things that they had~
brought.
6 Then he said to them secretly: Bless ye the God of heaven, give glory to him~
in the sight of all that live, because he hath shewn his mercy to you.
7 For it is good to hide the secret of a king: but honourable to reveal and~
confess the works of God.
8 Prayer is good with fasting and alms more than to lay up treasures of gold:
9 For alms delivereth from death, and the same is that which purgeth away sins,~
and maketh to find mercy and life everlasting.
10 But they that commit sin and iniquity, are enemies to their own soul.
11 I discover then the truth unto you, and I will not hide the secret from you.
12 When thou didst pray with tears, and didst bury the dead, and didst leave thy~
dinner, and hide the dead by day in thy house, and bury them by night, I offered~
thy prayer to the Lord.
13 And because thou wast acceptable to God, it was necessary that temptation~
should prove thee.

[Responsory2]
R. When Tobias went forth he found a very well-favoured young man standing with~
his loins girded, and as it were ready to set forth, and he saluted him and said
* Whence art thou, O good young man?
V. And he knew not that it was an Angel of the Lord, and saluted him, and said :
R. Whence art thou, O good young man?

[Lectio4]
!Tob 12:14-22
14 And now the Lord hath sent me to heal thee, and to deliver Sara thy son's~
wife from the devil.
15 For I am the angel Raphael, one of the seven, who stand before the Lord.
16 And when they had heard these things, they were troubled, and being seized~
with fear they fell upon the ground on their face.
17 And the angel said to them: Peace be to you, fear not.
18 For when I was with you, I was there by the will of God: bless ye him, and~
sing praises to him.
19 I seemed indeed to eat and to drink with you: but I use an invisible meat and~
drink, which cannot be seen by men.
20 It is time therefore that I return to him that sent me: but bless ye God, and~
publish all his wonderful works.
21 And when he had said these things, he was taken from their sight, and they~
could see him no more.
22 Then they lying prostrate for three hours upon their face, blessed God: and~
rising up, they told all his wonderful works
