This website was created and designed by the late Laszlo Kiss.
Mr. Kiss, longtime resident of Forrest Lake, Illinois,
died suddenly at his home on Monday, 11 July 2011,
shortly after returning from a walk with his wife Marta.
He was three days shy of his 73rd birthday.
Mr. Kiss was born in Budapest, Hungary, on 14 July 1938,
and married Marta Noske on 31 January 1968.
He worked in Budapest as a computer engineer until emigrating
to the United States of America in 1982.
In 1983, he developed "Image,"
one of the first computer-controlled manufacturing systems in the world
(still in use to this day).
He retired in 2000, and, among other things,
selflessly devoted hundreds of hours to creating the website
divinumofficium.com,
which provides free access to many different versions of the Divine Office
(or <it>breviary</it>),
the traditional daily prayer book of the Roman Catholic Church.
His funeral was held at St. Peter's Catholic Church in Volo, Illinois,
on the Feast of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel (16 July).
Mr. Kiss is survived by three brothers in Hungary,
and in the States by his loving wife Marta (of forty-three years),
their two sons Zoltan and Chaba, and their two grandchildren Sophie and Ryan.
</P>

<P>
On Monday, August 15, 2011, the Solemnity of the Assumption of Our Lady,
The Divinum Officium Project was founded,
with the permission of Laszlo's son Chaba,
to preserve and further Laszlo's work and to promote the
worship of the Triune God through the Divine Office.
Currently, The Divinum Officium Project consists of a diocesan priest
as well as three software developers who maintain the site and ensure its accuracy.
