From the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke (xiii. 6.)
At that time Jesus spake unto the multitudes this parable A certain man~
had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard, and he came and sought fruit thereon,~
and found none. And so on. 
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great.) 
!31st on the Gospels.
Our Lord and Redeemer speaketh unto us sometimes by words, and~
sometimes by deeds, sometimes one thing by words, and another by deeds, and~
sometimes the same thing both by word and deed. In the portion of the Gospel~
which hath this day been read, ye have heard, my brethren, two things, the~
parable of the fig-tree and the history of the woman which was bowed together.~
In both is a manifestation of the Lord's mercy, but in the one by a parable, in~
the other by an example. But the barren figtree signifieth the same thing as~
doth the woman bowed together, and the patience shown to the fig-tree the same~
thing as doth the healing of the woman bowed together.

What is the fig-tree a type, but of mankind Of what is the woman bowed~
together by a spirit of infirmity a type, but of the same mankind Man was~
originally placed in a garden like the fig-tree, and created upright like the~
woman, but man fell away by his own wilful fault like the fig-tree he brought~
forth no fruit like the woman he ceased to stand straight. When he wilfully~
went into sin, because he would not bring forth the fruit of obedience, he lost~
his uprightness. The nature which had been created in the image of God,~
continued not in honour, but cast aside the state wherein it had been placed and~
made. The lord of the vineyard came thrice to the fig-tree, for God hath come in~
hope, and in warning, seeking fruit from mankind under three successive~
dispensations, that is to say, before the law, under the law, and under grace.

It came before the law, in that by natural understanding, He let all know by~
example of Himself, what and how they should do toward their neighbour. In the~
law He came teaching. After the law He came by grace, opening, manifesting His~
merciful Presence. But after all these three years He yet hath to complain that~
He findeth no fruit upon the fig-tree, for there are still some degraded minds~
which the inborn voice of the natural law doth not control, which the~
commandments do not teach, and which the wonders of the Incarnation itself do~
not convert. Of what is the dresser of the vineyard a type, but of the~
Episcopacy? For these are they who have the government in the Church, and~
are therefore truly called the dressers of the Lord's vineyard.

Give light, O Lord, to them that sit in darkness, * and guide our feet into the~
way of peace, O Thou the God of Israel.

[Versum 2]
V. We are filled in the morning with thy mercy:
R. And we have rejoiced, and are delighted

[Oratio]
O God, Who hast chosen healthy fasting, as a mean to do good both to bodies and~
to souls, we humbly implore thy Majesty, that the godly prayer of such as be~
fasting this day may turn away thy wrath, and may be effectual to gain for us~
thy blessing in time and in eternity.

v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 13:6-17
13:6 He spoke also this parable: A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it, and found none.
13:7 And he said to the dresser of the vineyard: Behold, for these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and I find none. Cut it done therefore: why cumbereth it the ground?
13:8 But he answering, said to him: Lord, let it alone this year also, until I dig about it, and dung it.
13:9 And if happily it bear fruit: but if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down.
13:10 And he was teaching in their synagogue on their sabbath.
13:11 And behold there was a woman, who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years: and she was bowed together, neither could she look upwards at all.
13:12 Whom when Jesus saw, he called her unto him, and said to her: Woman, thou art delivered from thy infirmity.
13:13 And he laid his hands upon her, and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.
13:14 And the ruler of the synagogue (being angry that Jesus had healed on the sabbath) answering, said to the multitude: Six days there are wherein you ought to work. In them therefore come, and be healed; and not on the sabbath day.
13:15 And the Lord answering him, said: Ye hypocrites, doth not every one of you, on the sabbath day, loose his ox or his ass from the manger, and lead them to water?
13:16 And ought not this daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?
13:17 And when he said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the things that were gloriously done by him.
