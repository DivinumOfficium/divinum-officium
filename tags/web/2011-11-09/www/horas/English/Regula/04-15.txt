04-15# The Rule of our Holy Father Benedict. Chapter 61: Concerning Monks Who Are Strangers, How They Should Be Received
_
If any monk arrive a stranger from distant parts and if he wish to dwell, as a guest, in the monastery and be content with the customs of the place as he find them and does not by chance disturb the monastery with his superfluous wants, but is in simplicity content with what he finds, let him be received for as long as he likes. Indeed if in a reasonable manner and with the humility of charity he rebukes or points out anything amiss let the abbot prudently investigate the matter lest by chance God sent him for this very thing. And if afterwards he should wish to be strengthened by stability, let not such wish be refused and especially because the time he was a guest afforded opportunity of judging of his manner of life.
