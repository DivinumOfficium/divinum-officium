[Ant 1]
In patience * hast thou possessed thy soul, Lucy, Bride of Christ thou hast~
hated the things that are in the world, and art glorified among the Angels; thou~
hast shed thine own blood, and conquered the Adversary.

[Oratio]
Graciously hear us, O God of our salvation; that as we rejoice in the festivity~
of blessed Lucy, thy Virgin and Martyr, we may be instructed in the affections~

[Lectio4]
Lucy was a maiden of Syracuse, the daughter of a noble Christian family. Her~
mother Eutychia, being afflicted with an issue of blood, went with her to~
Catania, to pray before the body of the blessed Agatha. Lucy, by her earnest~
prayers at the grave, obtained her mother's cure, through the intercession of~
Agatha, and then immediately begged her to give to Christ's poor the whole dowry~
which had been set apart for herself. As soon, therefore, as they returned to~
Syracuse, they sold the property, and distributed the money among the poor.

[Responsory4]
R. Maiden Lucy, why seekest thou of me that which thou thyself canst presently~
give thy mother? For thy faith hath holpen her, and, behold, she is made whole
* Because thou hast made in thy virginity a pleasant dwelling-place for thy God.
V. Even as Christ hath by me glorified Catania, so by thee shall He glorify~
Syracuse.
R. Because thou hast made in thy virginity a pleasant dwellingplace for thy God.

[Lectio5]
When this came to the ears of one to whom her parents had betrothed her against~
her will, he accused Lucy before Paschasius the Prefect of being a Christian.~
The Prefect could not move her to commit idolatry, either by his entreaties or~
his threats; nay, the more he strove to persuade her, so much the bolder did she~
become in her confession. Then, seeing that he could prevail nothing, words,~
saith he, will cease when we come to blows. To whom the virgin answered, God's~
servants will never want words, for the Lord Christ hath said When ye shall~
stand before kings and governors, take no thought how or what ye shall speak,~
for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak, for it is not~
ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost Which speaketh in you. (Matth. x. 18-20; Mark~
xiii. 9-11.)

[Responsory5]
R. I besought my Lord Jesus Christ that this fire might not take hold upon me
* And I obtained from the Lord that I should not finish my testimony for yet a~
while.
V. For so much as they loved me, so bitterly spake they against me: but I gave~
myself unto prayer.
R. And I obtained from the Lord that I should not finish my testimony for yet a~
while.

[Lectio6]
Then Paschasius asked her saying, Is the Holy Ghost in thee? Whereto she~
answered, They that live in chastity and piety are the temples of the Holy~
Ghost. Then, said he, I will send thee to be prostituted in a brothel, and get~
the Holy Ghost out of thee. To whom she made reply, Thou canst not prostitute my~
will. If thou cause this poor body to be violated, the crown of my soul's purity~
will be brighter through suffering. Then he bade them take her to the place of~
shame, but by the power of God it became impossible to move her. Whereupon,~
being inflamed with anger, he had pitch, resin, and boiling oil poured upon her,~
and then set on fire. But the fire did not take hold upon her. Therefore he~
practised many other cruelties upon her, and at last thrust a sword through her~
neck. When Lucy had received this wound, she began to speak of the peace of the~
Church, which it should enjoy after the death of Diocletian and Maximian, and~
presently returned her soul into the hands of God. She testified on the~
thirteenth day of December. Her body was buried at Syracuse, but afterwards~
taken to Constantinople, and lastly to Venice.

[Responsory6]
R. The Lord made her to prevail in the battle, and she was glorified in the~
sight of God and man she spake wisdom before princes
* And the Lord of all loved her.
V. God shall help her with His countenance God is in the midst of her she shall~
not be moved.
R. And the Lord of all loved her.
&Gloria
R. And the Lord of all loved her.

While St. Lucy was praying, * the blessed Agatha appeared unto her, and consoled the handmaiden of Christ
O virgin Lucy, * wherefore askest thou of me what thou canst thyself forthwith obtain for thy mother?
Through thee, O virgin Lucy, * the city of Syracuse shall be made glorious by the Lord Jesus Christ
I bless thee, * O Father of my Lord Jesus Christ, for through thy Son the fire was extinguished round about me
Lucy my sister, * thou virgin consecrated to God, wherefore askest thou of me what thou canst thyself forthwith obtain for thy mother?

[Ant 2]
Thou art become as a pillar * that cannot be shaken, Lucy, O Bride of Christ:~
all the people wait for thee, until thou receive the crown of life, alleluia.

[Ant 3]
With such power * did the Holy Spirit fix her to the ground, that the virgin of~
Christ remained immovable.

[Lectio94]
Lucy a virgin of Syracuse, noble by birth and by her Christian faith, went to~
the tomb of St. Agatha at Catheria and obtained the cure of her.mother, Eutichia~
who was suffering from a hemorrhage. Soon after, she gained her mother's~
permission to distribute to .the poor all the possessions which were to have~
served as her dowry. As a result of this charitable action, she was accused of~
being a Christian and brought before Paschasius the Prefect. When neither~
promises nor threats could induce her to sacrifice the idols, Paschasius became~
enraged and commanded Lucy to be taken to a place where her virginity would be~
violated. But the power of God gave the virgin a strength that matched the~
firmness of her resolution, so that no force could move her where she stood. And~
so the prefect commanded a fire to be kindled all around here, but the flames~
did not harm her. After she had suffered many torments, therefore her throat was~
pierced through with a sword. So wounded she foretold that the Church would have~
peace after the deaths of Diocletian and Maximilian, and on December 13 she gave~
up her spirit, to God. Her body was first buried at Syracuse, than taken to~
Constantinople, and finally transferred to Venice.
