Lesson from the letter of St Paul the Apostle to the Philippians
!Phil 3:17-21; 4:1-3
Brethren: Be imitators of me, and mark those who walk after the pattern you have in us. For many walk, of whom I have told you often and now tell you even weeping, that they are enemies of the Cross of Christ. Their end is ruin, their god is the belly, their glory is in their shame, they mind the things of earth. But our citizenship is in heaven from which also we eagerly await a Savior, our Lord Jesus Christ, Who will refashion the body of our lowliness, conforming it to the body of His glory by exerting the power by which he is able also to subject all things to Himself. So then, my brethren, beloved and longed for, my joy and my crown, stand fast thus in the Lord, beloved. I entreat Evodia and I exhort Syntyche to be of one mind in the Lord. And I beseech you also, my loyal comrade, help them, for they have toiled with me in the gospel, as have Clement and the rest of my fellow-workers whose names are in the book of life.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt. 16:13-19
At that time, Jesus, having come into the district of Caesarea Philippi, began~
to ask His disciples, saying, Who do men say the Son of Man is? But they said,~
Some say, John the Baptist; and others, Elias; and others, Jeremia, or one of~
the prophets. He said to them, But who do you say that I am? Simon Peter~
answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God. Then Jesus~
answered and said, Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jona, for flesh and blood has not~
revealed this to you, but My Father in heaven. And I say to you, you are Peter,~
and upon this rock I will build My Church, and the gates of hell shall not~
prevail against it. And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and~
whatever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
