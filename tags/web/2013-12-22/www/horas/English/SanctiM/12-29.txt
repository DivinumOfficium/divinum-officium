Here beginneth the Letter of Blessed Paul Apotle to the Romans
!Rom 1:1-7
1 Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the~
gospel of God,
2 Which he had promised before, by his prophets, in the holy scriptures,
3 Concerning his Son, who was made to him of the seed of David, according to the~
flesh,
4 Who was predestinated the Son of God in power, according to the spirit of~
sanctification, by the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead;
5 By whom we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith, in~
all nations, for his name;
6 Among whom are you also the called of Jesus Christ:
7 To all that are at Rome, the beloved of God, called to be saints. Grace to you,~
and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

!Rom 1:8-12
8 First I give thanks to my God, through Jesus Christ, for you all, because your~
faith is spoken of in the whole world.
9 For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of his Son,~
that without ceasing I make a commemoration of you;
10 Always in my prayers making request, if by any means now at length I may have a~
prosperous journey, by the will of God, to come unto you.
11 For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual grace, to~
strengthen you:
12 That is to say, that I may be comforted together in you, by that which is~
common to us both, your faith and mine.

!Rom 1:13-19
13 And I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that I have often purposed to~
come unto you, (and have been hindered hitherto,) that I might have some fruit~
among you also, even as among other Gentiles.
14 To the Greeks and to the barbarians, to the wise and to the unwise, I am a~
debtor;
15 So (as much as is in me) I am ready to preach the gospel to you also that are~
at Rome.
16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel. For it is the power of God unto salvation~
to every one that believeth, to the Jew first, and to the Greek.
17 For the justice of God is revealed therein, from faith unto faith, as it is~
written: The just man liveth by faith.
18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and~
injustice of those men that detain the truth of God in injustice:
19 Because that which is known of God is manifest in them. For God hath~
manifested it unto them.
